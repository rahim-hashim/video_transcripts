# Sean Hannity: The pro-Hamas crowd is running the show
**Fox News:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and this is a Fox, a Fox News alert we begin with tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are monitoring a developing situation out of NYU in New York City, where disruptive anti-Israeli [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=7.92s)]
*  protesters are now clashing with police. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=14.66s)]
*  We're going to have more on this straight ahead tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=18.0s)]
*  Plus Donald Trump's stuck in New York in a criminal court, where a bogus political witch [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=19.88s)]
*  hunt is now entering its second week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Just one block away, a big win for President Trump in a New York civil court. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=28.4s)]
*  Coming up, we'll help you keep track of the left's fully weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=33.32s)]
*  We'll talk to two people that were in the courtroom today, and we'll get reaction from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=38.56s)]
*  Eric Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  And a shocking news story about the Democrats, who are now trying to take away the former [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=43.08s)]
*  president's Secret Service protection, which would leave President Trump and his family [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=47.64s)]
*  very vulnerable. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  Not a good idea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=54.08s)]
*  Also tonight, we'll hear from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft will be with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=55.28s)]
*  He is now cutting off all donations to his alma mater, and that would be Columbia University [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=60.44s)]
*  because of the quote, virulent hate that continues to grow on campus. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=66.52s)]
*  Now take a look at your screen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=71.36s)]
*  This is what he is talking about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=72.84s)]
*  A young woman at Columbia holding up a sign that reads quote, Al Qassam's text, next targets. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=74.96s)]
*  Okay, an arrow pointing to the students that are standing behind her waving Israeli and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=82.04s)]
*  American flags. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=87.84s)]
*  Now Al Qassam is the militarized terrorist wing of Hamas responsible for the worst, the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=89.44s)]
*  most barbaric terrorist attack in the history of Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=95.72s)]
*  Remember they buried babies alive. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  They beheaded men, women and children. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=101.64s)]
*  They took infants as hostages. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=104.14s)]
*  They used rape as a weapon of war, over 1,200 dead in a day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=106.32s)]
*  And this woman on your screen, face covered with a scarf, is hoping for more of the same. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  She's not alone. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=116.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=117.44s)]
*  Never forget the 7th of October! [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=141.12s)]
*  That will happen! [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=143.12s)]
*  Never forget the 7th of October! [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=144.12s)]
*  Not one more time! [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=146.12s)]
*  Not five more times! [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=147.12s)]
*  Not ten more times! [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=148.12s)]
*  Not a hundred more times! [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=150.12s)]
*  Not a thousand more times! [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=151.12s)]
*  Not a thousand times! [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=153.12s)]
*  For ten thousand times! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=154.12s)]
*  And things have gotten so bad, a rabbi at Columbia University calling for students now to leave the campus, and they have, and they now have to finish their semesters online. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=156.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=166.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=167.12s)]
*  Because the school has been unwilling, unable to safeguard these students in the face of what is extreme anti-Semitism and nothing but utter anarchy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=168.12s)]
*  Now, one pro-Israel professor, he was even reportedly banned from Columbia's campus. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=177.12s)]
*  His key card allegedly deactivated. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=183.12s)]
*  His counter-protest was not allowed on school grounds because of the, quote, obviously risk to the safety of the students. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=186.12s)]
*  In other words, the pro-Hamas crowd, they're now running the show. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=194.12s)]
*  They have taken over a big part of the university. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=198.12s)]
*  Dissent, no longer safe, at an Ivy League institution. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=201.12s)]
*  Now, the base of the Democratic Party, they have gone from self-proclaimed, open-minded, peace-loving hippies to radical terrorist sympathizers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=205.12s)]
*  You know, the very people that would get triggered if you used the wrong pronoun. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=214.12s)]
*  Now they are justifying violence and really offering what is nothing short of aid and comfort to terrorists. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=219.12s)]
*  Now, to his credit, there is one Democrat, only one, and that's John Federman, of all people, calling these protests reprehensible and demanding Columbia's president step down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=226.12s)]
*  Now, Senator Tim Scott, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, and several other Republican lawmakers, they have also called for Columbia's president to resign. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=237.12s)]
*  She should be fired before she resigns. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=246.12s)]
*  New York Times, well, they're describing the protest as one big happy party. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=249.12s)]
*  Quote, at Columbia, the protest continued with dancing and pizza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=254.12s)]
*  That's just like the summer of 2020. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=259.12s)]
*  574 mostly peaceful riots. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=261.12s)]
*  Remember, dozens of dead Americans, cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, and billions in property damage. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=265.12s)]
*  Mostly peaceful. Why? Because they wanted that vote. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=274.12s)]
*  I guess they missed the calls for a global antifada across our country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=278.12s)]
*  Similar protests, by the way, were happening in Yale, MIT, as you can see on your screen, NYU, far left radicalized students indoctrinated by their communist professors taking to the streets to call for what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=282.12s)]
*  The annihilation of Israel and the United States from the river to the sea? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=297.12s)]
*  And the Columbia president doesn't think that's okay? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=301.12s)]
*  But if you use the wrong pronoun, you're probably going to get expelled. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=306.12s)]
*  Joe Biden is now desperate to win their vote. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=310.12s)]
*  The same Joe Biden who claims he ran for president because of the bigotry and the hatred that he witnessed in Charlottesville. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=313.12s)]
*  Okay, but now, according to Joe, well, there are very good people on both sides of the protest. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=320.12s)]
*  He actually said it. Take a look. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=326.12s)]
*  Do you condemn the anti-Semitic protests on college campuses? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=328.12s)]
*  I condemn the anti-Semitic protests. That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=332.12s)]
*  I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=337.12s)]
*  I've heard how they're being... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=342.12s)]
*  Should the Columbia University president resign? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=344.12s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=346.12s)]
*  Should he resign? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=348.12s)]
*  Biden doesn't really care about the hatred, the bigotry, the calls for violence coming from the pro-Palestinian agitators. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=350.12s)]
*  Why? He needs their vote. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=358.12s)]
*  Like Democrats in the summer of 2020, they needed the votes of the people that were rioting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=360.12s)]
*  It's why there was no congressional hearing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=366.12s)]
*  He's more than willing to look the other way. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=368.12s)]
*  But the good people there on every side of this, people don't understand the other side. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=371.12s)]
*  The guy who once worried about schools being integrated because they'd become racial jungles [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=377.12s)]
*  isn't bothered by what? A little anti-Semitism, radical hatred, support of terrorist organizations. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=383.12s)]
*  The guy that threw Israel under the bus after he stuck a knife in their back and twisted it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=389.12s)]
*  just isn't bothered by calls for the world's only Jewish state to be annihilated. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=394.12s)]
*  And it's happening in the halls of Congress. It's happening on college campuses. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=400.12s)]
*  It's happening in Europe. It's happening worldwide. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=405.12s)]
*  And as it turns out, Joe Biden's hand-wringing over Charlottesville, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=408.12s)]
*  just another made-up story from a guy who has little sympathy for anyone whose last name is not Biden, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=412.12s)]
*  even his own four-year-old granddaughter, for example. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=419.12s)]
*  Biden promised to restore the soul of a nation. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=422.12s)]
*  Instead, he is fomenting moral rot and division all in an effort because he wants to win Michigan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=425.12s)]
*  He wants to win the election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=431.12s)]
*  Of course, his political ambition knows no bounds. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=433.12s)]
*  In the process, Biden, his allies, they are providing cover for what is vile, hateful, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=436.12s)]
*  a movement that is now picking up steam around the country and even in the halls of Congress. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=442.12s)]
*  Not far from ground zero, by the way. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=448.12s)]
*  Far-left radicals openly supporting one of the world's worst terrorist groups and Joe Biden's lecturing Israel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=450.12s)]
*  The only message he should be sending is, go win your war against those people that are trying to kill you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=458.12s)]
*  in the name of, quote, some radical religion that they're practicing, meaning those that believe in radical Islam. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=465.12s)]
*  Don't forget, before and after the rape, murder and, you know, killing of nearly 1,200, the abduction on October 7th, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=473.12s)]
*  Hamas, a terrorist organization, radical jihadists, have waged a nonstop campaign of terror against civilians on both sides of the border. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=481.12s)]
*  If you go back to the year 2005, since that time, Hamas has launched more than 20,000 rockets indiscriminately into Israel, killing many Israelis. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=491.12s)]
*  If not for Israel's Iron Dome, hundreds of thousands of civilians would likely be dead. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=502.12s)]
*  When you get radical members of Joe Biden's far-left base, they now feel very comfortable openly supporting the terrorist organization whose own charter calls for Israel's destruction, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=508.12s)]
*  defending, making excuses for terrorists, trying to get Israel to back down and just accept that this is their way of life. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=519.12s)]
*  That's your modern democratic radicalized party. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=528.12s)]
*  The icing on the cake. One day, if Joe Biden gets his way, you're probably going to be forced to pay off the massive student loans for all of those radicals on all of these campuses, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=531.12s)]
*  whose literally, you know, their role is always to play America's ultimate victims, all because Joe Biden, he wants to buy their vote. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=541.12s)]
*  Don't forget it anywhere else. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhh-qVMZGt0&t=561.12s)]
