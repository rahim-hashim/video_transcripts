# Trump is telling the Middle East he will make changes, Steve Witkoff says
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q)
*  Here with more, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Steve, great to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=4.32s)]
*  Two big messages that I see tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=5.42s)]
*  Number one, Iran can never and will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Number two, Gaza, which has been destroyed, can no longer be a launching pad for Hamas [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=12.48s)]
*  or other radical Islamic terrorists. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=18.56s)]
*  And knowing Donald Trump as I do—tell me if I'm wrong, is he not telling the Middle [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=22.88s)]
*  East that it's time for you to step up and absorb the population of the Palestinian people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=28.64s)]
*  and rebuild this and demilitarize this area? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=35.64s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me tonight, Sean. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=40.24s)]
*  I think he's telling the Middle East that the last 50 years of doing things was not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  a correct way of doing things and that he's going to change it up because all of those [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=48.28s)]
*  iterations have not worked. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=52.84s)]
*  He's also telling the Middle East that he wants to be transparent with the Palestinian [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=55.24s)]
*  people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  That Gaza today is uninhabitable and will probably be uninhabitable for at least the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  next 10 to 15 years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  That's how much work has to be done there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=68.04s)]
*  Are other countries in the region, Steve—because you have been deep into the negotiations on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  all sides—are they willing to step up, help this population, and rebuild the area and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=77.96s)]
*  demilitarize it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  I think everybody wants to see peace in the region, Sean. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=88.08s)]
*  And peace in the region means a better life for the Palestinians. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=91.8s)]
*  A better life is not necessarily tied to the physical space that you're in today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  A better life is about a better opportunity, better financial conditions, better access, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=101.08s)]
*  better aspirations for you and your family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=107.92s)]
*  That doesn't occur because you get to pitch a tent in the Gaza Strip and you're surrounded [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  by 30,000 munitions that could go off at any moment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=117.0s)]
*  It's a dangerous place to live today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And the president is saying, let's make it better for these people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  Let's give them more hope. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=128.28s)]
*  And if there are different places for them to live, let them make that choice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=130.16s)]
*  And I think he's right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he said, let's get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it, create an economic development [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=137.64s)]
*  that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=143.92s)]
*  Where the media is freaking out is, oh, Donald Trump's going to take over Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=148.84s)]
*  But there's one other thing is—and the president was very clear—Iran. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=152.6s)]
*  We look at the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  They fund Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Houthi rebels. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=161.54s)]
*  They launch their own ballistics into Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=165.72s)]
*  This has to stop. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=169.88s)]
*  Will it stop? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=170.88s)]
*  Well, you've heard the president say it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=171.88s)]
*  That's his direction. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=175.24s)]
*  And I couldn't agree with him more. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=176.8s)]
*  They cannot have a weapon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=178.46s)]
*  If they have a weapon, a nuclear weapon, then every other country in the GCC is going to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=180.02s)]
*  look to get one. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=185.64s)]
*  And now the arms race is on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=186.94s)]
*  That's an unacceptable place for the GCC to go. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=188.48s)]
*  He will stop it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=192.8s)]
*  The beginning of that is maximum sanctions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=193.88s)]
*  Hopefully we don't have to go past that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=196.64s)]
*  And beyond that, Sean, it's not just a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=199.56s)]
*  Iran has been the benefactor for Hamas, for Hezbollah, and now for the Houthis, and that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=202.88s)]
*  has to end. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=208.84s)]
*  And the president has said that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=209.98s)]
*  Will President Trump, if needed, if the Israelis believe they're on the verge of a nuclear [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=213.56s)]
*  Will he provide bunker buster bombs? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Because there was a report today that he will provide weapons that Joe Biden would never [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=222.44s)]
*  provide. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, the president has signed orders today that resupply the Israelis with ammunition. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=228.24s)]
*  And they already have bunker buster bombs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=237.24s)]
*  But I think the president would prefer that the Iranians say we've had enough. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=239.64s)]
*  But I hope that they do say that, Sean. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=247.88s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=251.6s)]
*  I hope for peace. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=253.4s)]
*  But you know, I'm a trust but verify guy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=254.72s)]
*  Steve, I know you've been doing a lot of shuttle diplomacy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=256.56s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMrWmM5S2Q&t=259.2s)]
