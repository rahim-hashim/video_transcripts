# Tulsi Gabbard: Kamala Harris is ‘lying through her teeth’
**Fox News:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg)
*  All right, as he continues to expand his coalition of supporters, Donald Trump has reached across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=0.0s)]
*  partisan lines, adding R.F.K. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=7.0s)]
*  Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard to his transition team. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=9.36s)]
*  Yesterday, Tulsi called out Kamala for trying to change the debate rules against Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Now, during the 2020 campaign, Tulsi Gabbard completely humiliated Kamala on the debate [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=17.92s)]
*  stage, shortly before she suspended her campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=24.2s)]
*  This is a great moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  You may remember it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=29.52s)]
*  Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=31.52s)]
*  president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=44.04s)]
*  She blocked evidence. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=48.8s)]
*  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=49.8s)]
*  forced her to do so. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=56.44s)]
*  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=58.08s)]
*  of California, and she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=62.48s)]
*  in the worst kind of way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=69.08s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=72.24s)]
*  Checkmate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=73.24s)]
*  Anyway, meanwhile, Democratic strategist James Carville said Americans are hoping the debate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=74.24s)]
*  is like a train wreck, just like the one in June. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=79.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=82.32s)]
*  It's going to get an enormous rating. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=83.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=85.88s)]
*  Because there's nothing more that America likes than a train wreck, and they saw one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=87.08s)]
*  on June 27th, so they're going to tune in and hope to see another train wreck. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  People just love train wrecks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  They'll line up forever, and the last one is or was one, maybe the biggest ever, and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  they'll be watching anticipation come September 10th. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Here with reaction 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=107.96s)]
*  By the way, you're still, you're not on the terror watch list any longer, are you, Tulsi? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=112.44s)]
*  You know, another shocking story as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=116.64s)]
*  I hope that's all resolved. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, Sean, I wish I could say the same, but it has not been resolved. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=121.24s)]
*  I've been informed that the targeting package that the TSA created for me when they put [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  me on the secret domestic terror watch list is still operational. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=131.24s)]
*  That is insane, and we'll stay on that case as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=136.12s)]
*  All right, that was a verbal beatdown. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=139.4s)]
*  You came in, you were armed with facts, also reports that you are part of Donald Trump's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=142.6s)]
*  debate prep team. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you tell him, without giving away private conversations you may have, about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  debating Kamala Harris? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Because she did go in with, you know, memorized lines to go after Joe Biden, and they were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=159.6s)]
*  effective to some level. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=165.76s)]
*  Yeah, they were. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  First of all, as you know, President Trump is not a politician at all. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=169.92s)]
*  He doesn't do traditional political debate prep. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=174.76s)]
*  He is prepared to debate Kamala Harris anytime, anywhere. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  I think the only place where I may possibly be of help is really conveying that experience [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=180.88s)]
*  that I had with her on the debate stage that you just played, sharing the kinds of games [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  she will play in order to try to hide her real record from the American people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=191.72s)]
*  It is clear that now that she is the candidate running for president on the Democratic ticket, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=198.72s)]
*  she is saying one thing while her record and her actions over the last three and a half [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=203.6s)]
*  years prove the exact opposite to be true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=207.84s)]
*  She is lying through her teeth every single day, which is incredibly insulting to the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=211.12s)]
*  American people and voters because she thinks that we are so stupid that we are going to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  just forget what she has done over the last three and a half years and all of a sudden [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  buy this new lie that she is selling us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=225.24s)]
*  And, you know, there are too many examples to cite, but you brought up my being on the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=228.76s)]
*  secret domestic terror watch list. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=232.92s)]
*  She says over and over again she's going to be the champion and defender of freedom. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=234.4s)]
*  And yet she and the Harris Biden administration continue their mission of political retaliation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  to censor free speech, to go after people like me for criticizing them and their actions [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=244.24s)]
*  and policies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=249.28s)]
*  And of course, their foremost target continues to be Donald J. Trump, as we've seen with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=250.28s)]
*  these new indictments that they've just rolled out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=254.68s)]
*  What she says, and this is what I'm encouraging people to pay attention to in this debate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  and in this campaign, don't listen to what she says because whenever she opens her mouth, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=261.36s)]
*  she is selling a lie. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=265.66s)]
*  Focus on her record. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=267.68s)]
*  And that's what President Trump will do, expose the truth about who Kamala Harris really [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=269.72s)]
*  is. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=273.8s)]
*  And this shows how corrupt the media in the country is because, you know, you have a wealth [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=274.8s)]
*  of radical statements. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=279.88s)]
*  So it was Donald Trump making them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=281.08s)]
*  They would have played them a thousand times a day. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And they have yet to play Kamala in her own words, which is why I put it up on my website. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=285.92s)]
*  So it's available for everybody. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=290.56s)]
*  They can share it on social media with their friends, family, co-workers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=291.96s)]
*  So Jason Miller said we had this issue of last minute changes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=296.36s)]
*  Now, Kamala and her team had already agreed to ABC, agreed to the same debate rules that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=300.32s)]
*  Joe Biden had with Donald Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=306.08s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, last minute, no, we want to change the rules. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=308.32s)]
*  I want the mics on the whole time. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=311.72s)]
*  Oh, no, we'd like to have the candidates sitting rather than standing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=312.72s)]
*  Can we bring in cheat sheets and notes into the debate? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=318.48s)]
*  Jason Miller's quoted as saying that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=322.0s)]
*  I'm like, is that true? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  That happened? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Is that is that evidence of fear on her part? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, the interesting thing here is not even Joe Biden asked to be seated during [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=331.0s)]
*  that debate. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=338.04s)]
*  Even Joe Biden asked to bring in notes and cheat sheets with him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, to me, it just is another proof point and evidence of how unfit Kamala Harris [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=343.36s)]
*  is to be our president and commander in chief and how she is unable to deliver a message [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=348.72s)]
*  that has not been scripted for her by her pollsters and the people behind the curtains [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=355.56s)]
*  who are not only controlling and making decisions for her and what she says and what she now [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=360.8s)]
*  supposedly stands for. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  But these are the very same people have been doing this with Joe Biden as the figurehead [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=367.0s)]
*  over these last three and a half years, which is a dangerous thing for our Democratic Republic [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=370.6s)]
*  because voters need to know that who they vote for is someone that they can hold accountable. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=374.92s)]
*  How do you hold accountable nameless, faceless people behind the curtains who are the ones [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=379.44s)]
*  actually making these decisions and actually calling the shots? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=383.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's great that you're a part of it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  And you know, I've gotten to know you a lot over the last year, and I will tell you, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=392.0s)]
*  you know, it's clear to me you want the best interests of the country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=397.12s)]
*  You know, to watch RFK Jr. and yourself get smeared and slandered and besmirched by people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=401.2s)]
*  that were formerly friends is a little unbelievable. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=408.32s)]
*  It shows, unfortunately—and this is one of the reasons I left the Democratic Party—that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=413.08s)]
*  the people in charge of the Democrat Party of today, they only care about power. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=418.08s)]
*  And this includes Kamala Harris, obviously at the forefront now of the Democratic Party. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=423.96s)]
*  She and her people will choose power, their own power, over the people and over the best [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=428.88s)]
*  interests of our country every single day. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's really the choice between voters. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=437.38s)]
*  Donald Trump stands for peace, freedom and prosperity. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=439.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris stands for more tyranny, taking away our freedom and more war, pushing us [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=443.08s)]
*  to the brink of nuclear war. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that's a scary proposition, but a very true one. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=451.64s)]
*  People need to know who they really are and what they've said. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=455.08s)]
*  And it's the most radical, extreme ticket ever in the history of the country. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=458.88s)]
*  And most Americans don't know yet. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=464.68s)]
*  They need to know. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=466.36s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thank you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NEbzwdEjWg&t=467.36s)]
