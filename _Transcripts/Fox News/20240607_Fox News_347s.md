# Vivek Ramaswamy: We have to revive ‘shared national values’
**Fox News:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo)
*  It is what it is here with reaction former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I'm watching the Democrats flailing. We keep reading reports. They're scared to death the about Joe Biden as their candidate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=6.44s)]
*  And you know the fact that Donald Trump was convicted in this bogus trial in New York has not impacted his poll numbers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=15.76s)]
*  I would be scared I guess too [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=23.28s)]
*  What is your reaction you think they keep him at this point do you think they're afraid to keep him do you think there's a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=25.720000000000002s)]
*  movement underground to get rid of him [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  Look I think the fact that the debate is taking place in June before the nominating convention of either party is the best sign [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=34.96s)]
*  Sean that that is the final hoop they're making the old man [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=42.16s)]
*  Joe Biden jump through before actually getting the nomination [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=45.32s)]
*  So if he exceeds expectations at the debate he hangs on for a thread for that nomination [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=48.36s)]
*  But if he falls short of those expectations make sure and get ready [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=53.56s)]
*  They're gonna be trotting out somebody else for that nomination. And you know who's waiting in line is definitely Clinton [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=57.24s)]
*  Okay, okay. So what are the expectations gonna be now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=62.92s)]
*  If I had to guess we might see a little more energetic Joe as a matter of fact, I would bet [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Probably half of your income on it or half of your net worth on it. I'm teasing and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=71.76s)]
*  But with all due respect [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=79.0s)]
*  I mean [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  I would imagine a lot of Red Bulls gonna you know Joe's gonna be drinking in the lead-up to that debate or whatever [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=81.36s)]
*  He was using or drinking a lot of caffeine the night of the State of the Union [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=87.32s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna come in flat [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  I think he's gonna be well rehearsed and I think he's gonna be wide awake because I think he's gonna drink a lot of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  caffeine or whatever [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=100.56s)]
*  This is his last shot and the reality is caffeine or Red Bull [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  I think you're being very kind with that Sean Donald Trump was right [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=106.76s)]
*  They need to do a drug test before that debate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=109.24s)]
*  But regardless of whether it's Biden or somebody else what we as a party need to do is step up and actually define [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=111.24s)]
*  What we stand for I think that's one of the risks of the path. They're leading us down [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=117.44s)]
*  We're criticizing Joe Biden his agenda. I've done plenty of that others in our party have done that too [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=122.28s)]
*  That's not gonna be good enough to win this election [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Decisively as we need to I'm worried [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=130.48s)]
*  And we may be on track to have another red wave like we had in 2022 the one that actually never came and so I think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  That the reality is we have to regardless of who they put up define what it means to be a conservative today [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=139.76s)]
*  What it means to be an American today? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=145.48s)]
*  Revive those shared national values that we're supposed to be celebrating on D-Day not go in the direction of political [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=147.72s)]
*  partisanship and toxicity in the direction that Hillary Clinton takes it but in our own direction [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Actually stand for what it means to be a citizen of this country and stand for actual alternative vision to that left-wing poison [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  And if I'm being honest, I don't think we've done a good enough job of that yet [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=166.08s)]
*  And that's what our work is cut out for us this year [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=169.68s)]
*  Daily Mail tip survey legitimate poll [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  reveals 70% believe that both candidates should undergo pharmaceutical screening before they face off in these debates and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=176.96s)]
*  Only 18% think drug tests are unnecessary now for high-performing athletes they get drug tested all the time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=186.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do it for president especially, you know considering that what we witnessed on at the State of the Union [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=193.8s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if it was caffeine. I'm not gonna venture a guest [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=200.88s)]
*  I'm not a doctor, but it certainly was not the guy we see every day was it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=204.04s)]
*  No wasn't but the reality is the American people deserve transparency [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  And we're talking about putting somebody in the office of the president the United States [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=213.76s)]
*  Representing this country when we are skating on thin ice the American people deserve to actually be able to make that choice in an informed way [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=217.48s)]
*  So Sean, I do think that debate is the final step for Biden if he underperforms there [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=224.48s)]
*  That is the final straw and you got to be prepared for a different puppet [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=229.76s)]
*  They're gonna try to ask you that and unfortunate side effect of that is we're gonna be hearing more from from folks like Hillary Clinton [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=233.28s)]
*  are you arguing that maybe Trump shouldn't go in for the kill and and and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  In that debate in other words that Trump should kind of lay back a little bit just make his points and and let Biden talk and and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=243.72s)]
*  Maybe not fight as hard as he normally would [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=252.96s)]
*  Strategically would that be a smart thing to do because I think it's better if he runs against Biden [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=256.04s)]
*  So look I think the smart thing to do is to actually make this a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=262.24s)]
*  Versus be four years of Trump four years of Biden compare the border compare the economy compare global stability and US security [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=265.96s)]
*  risks on every measure Trump wins by flying colors and that's a rare opportunity Sean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=273.28s)]
*  This is a once-in-a-century opportunity for voters the last time we had this was over a century ago where you can actually compare [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=278.24s)]
*  The records of both people running that's what Donald Trump [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  I believe needs to stay focused on and will stay focused on the reality is they're gonna try to lure him in every other possible [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=287.88s)]
*  Direction that's what these prosecutions are about but at the end of the day focus on the record [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=293.8s)]
*  Focus on the vision for this country that makes Joe Biden and his old age [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=298.42s)]
*  Irrelevant as Americans increasingly flock towards Trump the right answer for this country [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  Curiosity is getting the better of me of those boxing gloves over your right shoulder that I'm looking at is that what I'm looking at [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=308.3s)]
*  That's right [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=316.66s)]
*  You got to be ready to fight and sometimes you got to fight with the gloves off [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  And as I say you got to be strong enough to protect your kindness, so we keep it kind [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  But we're gonna have to fight when necessary [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=324.86s)]
*  Was it I know because I trade every day I hit every day and I hit hard [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPwHs5EaqQo&t=326.90000000000003s)]
