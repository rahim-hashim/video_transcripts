# Sen. Josh Hawley: Americans want their country back!
**Fox News:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI)
*  Unbelievable. Here now with reaction Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hawley, thank you for being here. Governor Hockel basically, as I heard it, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=4.4s)]
*  called people at that Bronx rally clowns. This comes weeks after she said, I'll [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  quote her exactly, young black kids in the Bronx who don't even know what the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=13.88s)]
*  word computer is. She had to walk that one back. But how do you insult children [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=18.2s)]
*  in the Bronx, apologize, and then weeks later insult the people on our screen? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=23.46s)]
*  Yeah, and then she wonders why all of these blue collar voters are voting for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=29.8s)]
*  Trump. I mean the easy answer is these folks are tired of being talked down to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=33.72s)]
*  by these Democrat politicians, these limousine liberals. I mean I'm sure she [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  set aside her glass of white wine in order to make that statement. And listen, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=42.32s)]
*  they want their country back. I mean they don't want the border open. They don't [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=45.88s)]
*  want illegals coming in here taking all of their jobs. They just want their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=49.16s)]
*  country back. And Donald Trump is the only person out there who's talking any [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=52.84s)]
*  And by the way, you want to talk about clowns in New York. They're all in that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=57.12s)]
*  courtroom. As you were just reporting on, Kayleigh, I mean what a joke that is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=60.64s)]
*  Everybody can see it. It's a total clown show. And the more the American people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=64.88s)]
*  look at it, the more they know that, oh my gosh, this is a joke. And Donald Trump, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=68.96s)]
*  it's just helping him. It's just helping him. It is. And Senator Hawley, I mean as [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=72.96s)]
*  you've heard Professor Turley say, there's layers of reversible error here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  What he means by that is I think there should be an acquittal. And it's actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  my prediction it'll be a hung jury because we are in Manhattan. But let's say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=85.92s)]
*  worst case scenario, if there's a guilty verdict, it should be reversed on appeal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=90.0s)]
*  because as you know, as an attorney, a former attorney general, the facts must [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=93.6s)]
*  match the law. But the New York Appellate Division, they've ruled against Trump on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=96.56s)]
*  the gag order. They've ruled against him on moving venue. They seem as bad as this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  judge. So can Trump remove this to federal court, go to where we have fair [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=104.64s)]
*  justices and get an appeal in the federal realm versus the New York realm? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that, Kayleigh. But listen, I mean, this is such a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=116.16s)]
*  joke. And I think the important thing is the American people are seeing it. I mean, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=119.28s)]
*  here the Democrats, all of their plans are falling apart. You know, they'd hope to keep [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump in trial forever. They'd hope that that would mean that the public would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=126.48s)]
*  desert him. In fact, the longer he's in trial, the more the public supports him [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=130.0s)]
*  because they can see this is totally a hoax of a case. They can see it's all [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=134.24s)]
*  political persecution. And my gosh, I mean, if they convict him, that'll probably just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=139.28s)]
*  seal the election. I mean, let's just have it now. The truth is the American [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=143.28s)]
*  people see right through this, Kayleigh, right through it. And it doesn't matter [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=147.44s)]
*  how much they try to rig it. They are not the American people aren't going to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=150.72s)]
*  stand for it. I think they're making that loud and clear. Senator Hawley, just a few [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=154.08s)]
*  moments here, but you do have two lawyers on that jury. Any lawyer, any lawyer [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=157.12s)]
*  worth his salt would see the facts do not match the law. So do you think there's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=162.24s)]
*  an attorney on that jury who will say to the rest, guys, this doesn't make sense. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=166.56s)]
*  This isn't how our legal system works. I sure hope so because it is quite clear. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=170.32s)]
*  I mean, listen, their chief, the prosecutor's chief witness is a serial [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=175.68s)]
*  liar and perjurer. You just had Jonathan Turley explain there is no theory here of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=179.68s)]
*  any crime whatsoever. That's before you get to the fact that their number one [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  witness has contradicted himself what a billion times on the stand. It is a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=188.16s)]
*  shambles. It's a joke. And I hope the jury will see that. I do too. Senator [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=192.24s)]
*  Hawley, thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZT3wAGbOI&t=196.64s)]
