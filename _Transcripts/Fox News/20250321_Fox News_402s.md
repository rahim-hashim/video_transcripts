# Dr. Drew Pinsky searches for the remedies to 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'
**Fox News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=0.0s)]
*  We've all heard of Trump Derangement Syndrome. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=5.0s)]
*  It's real. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=7.48s)]
*  But now there's a new Trump induced condition breaking out on the left, Trump travel anxiety. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=8.48s)]
*  Apparently some liberals who like to travel abroad, well, they're suddenly afraid because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=14.8s)]
*  they think the rest of the world shares their hatred of President Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=19.88s)]
*  For example, one friend group from California profiled in the New York Times recently took [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=24.96s)]
*  a trip to Mexico City, but only spoke to each other in French to avoid being identified [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=30.02s)]
*  as Americans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=35.78s)]
*  Here now with reaction is the host of Ask Dr. Drew on Rumble, Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=37.66s)]
*  All right, Doc, analyze this for us because it seems like a lot of people jumping at a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=43.38s)]
*  lot of shadows. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=49.38s)]
*  Well, let's think about it this way. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=51.38s)]
*  Trump Derangement, there's actually a husband and wife psychologist that actually defined [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=54.06s)]
*  the syndrome. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=58.82s)]
*  They use psychometrics to figure out what this thing is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=59.82s)]
*  Clearly it's afflicting some people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=62.86s)]
*  And the one feature that was universal in people who were really suffering from this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=64.74s)]
*  was a sense of external focus of control. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  In other words, things happen to them, sort of victim. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=73.06s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=75.64s)]
*  And also associated with that is kind of a narcissism. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=76.78s)]
*  And if you have a narcissistic personality trait, you're going to believe that the world [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=80.3s)]
*  is thinking about you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=85.06s)]
*  So your hatred, your panic, your psychotic feelings about President Trump are going to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=87.3s)]
*  be projected out to the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  The reality is the rest of the world, first of all, mostly already hates us when we travel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=93.06s)]
*  They're not super happy with American travelers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=97.46s)]
*  And secondarily, at most, whatever I've encountered has been sort of confusion. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=100.3s)]
*  If they have questions, they're sort of confused. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  It seems like a lot, but there is not hatred. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it depends where in the world you go, because a lot of places you go in the world, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=111.22s)]
*  they love America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=115.9s)]
*  I mean, they can't get enough of America. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=116.9s)]
*  For sure. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=119.42s)]
*  You know, there's places that maybe a lot of people don't go to Lithuania, but they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=120.42s)]
*  can't survive without us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=123.98s)]
*  You go to Romania, they love us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=125.26s)]
*  And quite frankly, I've been to Mexico since Donald Trump was elected. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  I didn't have any problem. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=131.94s)]
*  Nobody gave us any hard time at all. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=133.02s)]
*  But I do think that you're onto something that people get externally worried. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=135.5s)]
*  And it's interesting that you say about the narcissism, oh, they're all thinking about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  They know what my thoughts are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=143.78s)]
*  But what is it that Donald Trump is provoking that maybe other presidents or political figures [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=145.66s)]
*  haven't done? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to say exactly what the features are that he maintains that really triggers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=152.18s)]
*  this thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=158.72s)]
*  But somehow he pushes right on that button. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=159.82s)]
*  And fundamentally underneath this, or let's put it this way, another way of sort of conceptualizing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=162.34s)]
*  this is yet another mass formation or mass formation psychosis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=166.78s)]
*  20% of people really become hypnotized by the press. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=172.5s)]
*  They become hypnotized by their social echo chambers, and they can be persuaded very quickly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=176.54s)]
*  that 20% that they're in danger. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  They can be hysterical. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=184.7s)]
*  They can be delusional. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=185.77999999999997s)]
*  And to the extent that Trump derangement syndrome affects functioning, and I would dare say that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  having trouble traveling is beginning to affect functioning, then it becomes a real disorder. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=191.82s)]
*  Now what's underlying it, I would actually say that Trump derangement is sort of a symptom [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  of other disorders. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=201.04s)]
*  They feature of other disorders. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=202.48s)]
*  Although, as I said, these two psychologists have characterized it as a real syndrome. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=204.16s)]
*  It is not in the DSM-5. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=208.62s)]
*  And I know Minnesota is attempting to legislate it as a syndrome. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=210.58s)]
*  That will not increase the probability that we'll show up on a diagnostic manual. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=215.6s)]
*  Isn't there an easy remedy for these people? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=221.32s)]
*  If it scares you to go travel abroad because you're afraid of Donald Trump, maybe you just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=224.04s)]
*  Maybe you could go travel to some other place, maybe in the United States, or just not travel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=229.24s)]
*  Isn't that the easiest remedy? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=234.52s)]
*  No, it's not the remedy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=236.04s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=239.68s)]
*  Because what we know, contrary to the way we've sort of directed our youth in the last [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=241.04s)]
*  10 years, the way to develop mental health and resiliency, particularly around obsessive [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=246.12s)]
*  thoughts and anxiety, is exposure. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=251.4s)]
*  Exposure therapy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=254.76s)]
*  Tolerable exposure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=255.76s)]
*  Ideally, we'd expose them to President Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=257.0s)]
*  We'd make contact with him so he doesn't become that cartoon figure that they've heard [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=259.24s)]
*  about in their echo chambers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=263.08s)]
*  He becomes a human being. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  He becomes somebody they may or may not disagree with. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=266.32s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=268.64s)]
*  But as it is, we tell people, you need a safe space. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=269.64s)]
*  You can't be offended. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=273.36s)]
*  You need to protect yourself. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  That is how you create mental illness, particularly around OCD and depressive, excuse me, and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=276.36s)]
*  anxiety-type symptoms. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=282.52s)]
*  And that certainly is a feature of all this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=284.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there are some families, they just can't get together at Thanksgiving because [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=286.42s)]
*  it instantly devolves to talking about politics. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=292.5s)]
*  And there are a lot of people out there that just can't resist the idea that maybe they [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  would just talk about family or sports or entertainment and just not talk about that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  But exposure, you know, that's an interesting theory on how to deal with it, because some [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  people, I think it is very real for them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it for sure is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=316.06s)]
*  And it needs, as I said, because it's sort of a mass formation, 20 percent become thoroughly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=317.54s)]
*  hypnotized by this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=323.18s)]
*  About 10 percent are outside going, what is this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=324.54s)]
*  Before what is going on here? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  This doesn't feel right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=328.66s)]
*  Much the same way as COVID went. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=329.62s)]
*  And then about a 70 percent really doesn't care that much. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=331.26s)]
*  They just want to get on with their life. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=334.5s)]
*  They want, as people are often saying these days, they want the economy to grow. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=335.74s)]
*  They want jobs. They want to take care of their family. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=339.42s)]
*  That's the vast majority of Americans. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=341.62s)]
*  And those people are not the ones staying away from their family dinner tables. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=343.74s)]
*  It's that 20 percent that is hypnotized that makes all the trouble. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's that small percentage that wants to throw a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=354.82s)]
*  scares me. And I don't know. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=359.58s)]
*  You know, you may have some deep seated thoughts on how to how to deal with that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=361.34s)]
*  But law enforcement and incarceration may be a good remedy as well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=365.62s)]
*  That's just my personal take on it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=370.06s)]
*  Last thought to you. I would just say we. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=372.02s)]
*  We just don't bring consequences down enough. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=375.26s)]
*  That is what helps people contain their behaviors when their behaviors are destructive and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=377.98s)]
*  irrational. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=382.7s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pinsky, you're the best. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=385.46s)]
*  Appreciate joining us tonight. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=387.42s)]
*  Really do appreciate it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=389.3s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RX9pv7fsgA&t=400.06s)]
