# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 15, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU)
*  Ingram, this is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2.6s)]
*  Kamala's demeaning pitch to black men. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=5.34s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=8.74s)]
*  A five-point plan, including weed and money, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=14.08s)]
*  is how Kamala thinks she's gonna win over the black voters [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=17.36s)]
*  that she's losing, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  but they're smarter than she thinks they are. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=21.46s)]
*  What would you say to the people that would consider [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=24.62s)]
*  the timing of this proposal as political timing? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=27.16s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for your question [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=31.2s)]
*  and for being here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=32.9s)]
*  I've been in this race about 70 days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=35.84s)]
*  You can look at all my work before those 70 days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=38.56s)]
*  to know that this, what I'm talking about right now, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=41.08s)]
*  is not new and is not for the sake of winning this election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=43.1s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, many years ago, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=49.58s)]
*  when I clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=50.68s)]
*  I learned that there is nothing that bothers liberals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=52.72s)]
*  I mean, really bothers them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=56.5s)]
*  Bothers them more than minorities who think for themselves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=58.779999999999994s)]
*  And that means right now, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  they are spinning over new data coming out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=64.72s)]
*  about black views on Trump versus Harris. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=67.22s)]
*  And the bottom line is this, at this particular hour, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=70.62s)]
*  if you believe the polling, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=72.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's gonna put up the best performance [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  with black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=75.96s)]
*  Not 68 since 1960, that's 64 years ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  Now, he still only gets, what, 15% or so, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=83.4s)]
*  the black vote according to the New York Times poll. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=87.2s)]
*  But that's a 67% improving of the support he got in 2020. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=89.9s)]
*  And it's double what he got in 2016. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=96.2s)]
*  That's called progress. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=98.18s)]
*  But rather than try to figure out what Trump is saying, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=100.28s)]
*  what he did previously that resonates, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris recites lines written for her [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=107.22s)]
*  by her consultants. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=109.62s)]
*  Nothing substantive, just trash talk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=111.28s)]
*  Look at it in the context of how he actually thinks [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  and talks about black folks in America. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=117.92s)]
*  This man is dangerous. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=119.86s)]
*  Not to mention Roland. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=121.96s)]
*  Let's fast forward to right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=124.26s)]
*  He, his staff won't let him do a 60 minutes interview. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=126.92s)]
*  Now, hold the laughter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=131.36s)]
*  This from a woman who hid for most of the campaign [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=134.3s)]
*  and still hasn't held a press conference. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=138.1s)]
*  Nice try. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=139.54s)]
*  Now, according to Fox News power rankings, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=141.76s)]
*  Kamala's decline among men, Hispanics, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=143.4s)]
*  and black voters especially could be decisive factors [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=146.66s)]
*  in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=150.44s)]
*  Now, that's why Obama embarrassed himself last week [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  lecturing black men, that's still my favorite thing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=156.6s)]
*  of all last week, about how if they don't vote for Kamala, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=159.02s)]
*  they'll be considered essentially [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=163.52s)]
*  just a bunch of idiot sexists. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=165.08s)]
*  Well, that backfired big time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=167.62s)]
*  And he also threatened to bring Michelle to lecture them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  So how does Kamala win back black men? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=173.34s)]
*  Now, with a serious plan, I imagine, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  to ditch by dynamics and grow the economy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=179.04s)]
*  so black men have the jobs that they deserve, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=181.38s)]
*  or perhaps with a pledge to seal the border once and for all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=184.62s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=188.36s)]
*  Instead, she's dangling goodies [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=189.66s)]
*  that she knows she could never deliver on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=192.02s)]
*  She went on with Charlemagne the God this afternoon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=198.66s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, meaning history. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=204.68s)]
*  On the point of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=208.22s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=210.5s)]
*  But wait, there's more. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=212.82s)]
*  She says she's gonna fight for one million [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=214.64s)]
*  forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=217.54s)]
*  Now, aside from the fact that that's totally unconstitutional, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=221.38s)]
*  of course that's never stopped them before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=224.78s)]
*  And if none of that works, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=227.5s)]
*  she hopes that they're gonna feel better [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=229.1s)]
*  about the crappy economy and dangerous streets [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=231.02s)]
*  if they at least know they can smoke weed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=233.98s)]
*  and not be thrown in federal prison. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=236.92s)]
*  What public defenders who are around those days [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=239.38s)]
*  will tell you, I was the most progressive prosecutor [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=242.26s)]
*  in California on marijuana cases. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=245.82s)]
*  And as vice president, have been a champion [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=249.3s)]
*  for bringing marijuana down on the schedule. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=252.48s)]
*  So instead of it being ranked up there with heroin, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=254.74s)]
*  we bring it down and my pledge as president, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=258.17999999999995s)]
*  I will work on decriminalizing it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=260.34s)]
*  because I know exactly how those laws have been used [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  to disproportionately impact certain populations [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  and specifically black men. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=269.5s)]
*  Well, didn't she already do that when she was a prosecutor? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=271.79999999999995s)]
*  Did she already throw a bunch of people in jail for weed? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, she also added on her campaign website, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=277.82s)]
*  the typical gibberish about equity [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=280.17999999999995s)]
*  and price gouging on food and groceries. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's the same recycled proposal [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=286.38s)]
*  that has been roundly ridiculed even by Democrat economists. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=288.3s)]
*  So this all smacks of unseriousness [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=293.82s)]
*  and frankly desperation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=296.24s)]
*  Now, Obama again acted like black men were misogynists [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=298.34s)]
*  for not supporting Kamala. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=301.74s)]
*  And now Kamala is treating black men [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=303.86s)]
*  like they're too stupid to recognize a con artist [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=306.78s)]
*  when they see one. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=309.58s)]
*  As Barack Obama said, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=310.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris has an issue with the brothers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=312.38s)]
*  You texted me right around the Democratic convention [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=315.42s)]
*  and you said, I am talking to people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=318.3s)]
*  and Kamala Harris has a problem with black men. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=321.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I told the campaign, I did not hear from them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=323.38s)]
*  I mean, who am I for them to get back to me? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=326.18s)]
*  But there's a problem. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=328.06s)]
*  I went up to people just doing man on the street. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=329.62s)]
*  It's who are you gonna vote for? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=332.3s)]
*  Black men. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=333.14s)]
*  And time after time after time, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  they said, I'm voting for Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=335.82s)]
*  Kamala was supposed to be the pantsuit Messiah [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=338.1s)]
*  but she's really more of an actress. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=341.18s)]
*  When he was asked about what he was gonna do, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=344.06s)]
*  he says he's got concepts of a plan for how he'd replace it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=348.9s)]
*  He has no plan to replace it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=354.58s)]
*  You guys watched the debate. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=360.46s)]
*  Right, he has quote concepts of a plan, concepts. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=364.14s)]
*  Concepts. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=369.14s)]
*  Kamala is imitating Barack, but there's one problem. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  She's more like Hillary and the streets know it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=374.06s)]
*  There's nothing about the poll numbers [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=377.86s)]
*  that we're seeing right now [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=379.74s)]
*  that shouldn't make anybody feel like she got this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=380.7s)]
*  Remember those poll numbers with Hillary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=382.78s)]
*  Remember those poll numbers with Hillary [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  and I keep telling people this campaign [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  feels more Hillaryish than it does Obamaish, Obama08ish. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  When Hillary was in trouble with the black vote, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=393.38s)]
*  Democrats closed their eyes [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=395.46s)]
*  and prayed for the God to save her. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=397.02s)]
*  That's Sharla May and the God. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  But then Hillary pulled out the hot sauce. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=401.62s)]
*  What's something that you always carry with you? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=404.46s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=408.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  Are you getting information right now? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=410.64s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=412.18s)]
*  Hot sauce in my bag swag? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=414.26s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=416.38s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  Now listen, I want you to know people are gonna see this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=418.88s)]
*  and say, okay, she's pandering the black people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=421.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  Is it working? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=425.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=427.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  No, seriously hot sauce. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=429.38s)]
*  I've been eating a lot of hot sauce, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=431.34s)]
*  a lot of raw peppers and hot sauce. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=434.46s)]
*  Then Democrats tried it again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  They sent Biden in and he told them you ain't black. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  It's a long way until November. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  We got more questions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  You got more questions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=450.58s)]
*  No. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  Barack sent Harris to see the God, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=455.1s)]
*  hoping the third time's a charm. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=457.7s)]
*  Harris spent all day prepping for Charlemagne, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=459.78s)]
*  cleared her whole schedule for one interview at five o'clock. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=462.94s)]
*  The first question Charlemagne asked her, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=466.66s)]
*  do you ever say anything new? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=468.98s)]
*  What do you say to people who say [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  you stay on the talking points? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=472.58s)]
*  I would say you're welcome. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=474.26s)]
*  I mean, listen, here's the thing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=476.82s)]
*  I love having conversations, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=479.32s)]
*  which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=480.7s)]
*  And the reality is that there are certain things [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=488.1s)]
*  what I stand for and the issues that I think [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=492.62s)]
*  are at stake in this election. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  And so it requires repetition. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=496.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, some people say that if, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=498.26000000000005s)]
*  until someone has heard the same thing at least three times, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=500.62s)]
*  it just doesn't stay with you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=503.26s)]
*  So repetition is important. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  Kamala thinks voters are too ignorant [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=506.74s)]
*  to get her message through their thick skulls. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=508.62s)]
*  She has to repeat it like a hypnotist. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=511.26s)]
*  And it's not even working because no one ever knows [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=514.18s)]
*  what she's talking about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  This was kind of a virtual town hall [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=518.78s)]
*  with voters who called in and they wanted to know, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=520.7s)]
*  where's my money you promised? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=523.9s)]
*  My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=526.5s)]
*  I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=530.14s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=536.14s)]
*  meaning history to your point. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=538.78s)]
*  So my agenda, well, first of all, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  on the plane of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=544.14s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=546.38s)]
*  As it relates to the economy, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=547.9s)]
*  which is a lot of what you have addressed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=549.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, I grew up in the middle class. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  My mother, you know, worked hard, raised me and my sister. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=555.3399999999999s)]
*  And by the time I was in high school, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=558.14s)]
*  she was able to afford our first home. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=560.42s)]
*  I know what it means for an individual [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=563.06s)]
*  and a family to have home ownership. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=565.38s)]
*  Translation, you're not getting reparations. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=567.78s)]
*  I wanna give you reparations, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=570.4599999999999s)]
*  but they told me I can't say that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=572.18s)]
*  What I can say is that I grew up in the middle class. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=573.98s)]
*  Black men have been asking, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=578.06s)]
*  how are you gonna make my life better? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=579.98s)]
*  Because my life was better under Trump. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=581.86s)]
*  So Kamala, after four years of doing nothing, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=584.4599999999999s)]
*  just came out with a plan for black men. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  Legalize weed and $20,000 welfare checks. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=591.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=595.42s)]
*  Kamala wants to win the black vote [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=596.42s)]
*  with free money and drugs. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=598.06s)]
*  But protecting black jobs is offensive, okay? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  Even black voters are a little suspicious. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=605.06s)]
*  I read that there is a new opportunity agenda, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=608.78s)]
*  a plan for black men, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=612.02s)]
*  which includes a proposal of forgivable loans [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=613.26s)]
*  up to $20,000 for 1 million black entrepreneurs. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  What would you say to the people that would consider [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=620.3399999999999s)]
*  the timing of this proposal as political timing? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=622.9s)]
*  I've been in this race about 70 days. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=626.86s)]
*  You can look at all my work before those 70 days [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=629.58s)]
*  to know that what I'm talking about right now is not new [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=632.0600000000001s)]
*  and is not for the sake of winning this election. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=635.38s)]
*  This is about a longstanding commitment, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=637.78s)]
*  including the work that I've done as vice president [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=639.86s)]
*  and before when I was senator and before that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=642.02s)]
*  Kamala has been in power for four years. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=644.7s)]
*  Before that, she was a senator, never proposed this before. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=647.1s)]
*  And three weeks before the election, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=651.18s)]
*  after struggling with the black vote, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=653.34s)]
*  here's a check for 20 grand and a blunt. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=655.8199999999999s)]
*  Did Kamala even come up with this pitch? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=659.06s)]
*  Or did her white handlers sit around thinking, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  hmm, black people love handouts and getting high, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=664.06s)]
*  let's give this a shot. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=667.74s)]
*  Democrats have been in charge of the White House [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=670.06s)]
*  for 12 of the last 16 years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=672.14s)]
*  And black Americans feel like they haven't done anything. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=675.3s)]
*  One voter told the New York Times [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=678.9s)]
*  that they elected the first black president [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=680.66s)]
*  and we're still in the same place. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=683.14s)]
*  Blacks are bailing on Democrats because of their policies. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=686.18s)]
*  But Democrats are trying to reel them in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=689.6999999999999s)]
*  with identity politics. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=691.38s)]
*  As it goes to black men, yes, we're out making the case [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=693.5799999999999s)]
*  that we have historically low unemployment, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=696.3s)]
*  but we need to do more. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=698.5s)]
*  Our message is solid. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=699.4599999999999s)]
*  It's the right one for folks. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=700.9s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, they come back home. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  Walls is guaranteeing it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=705.3s)]
*  They'll come back home. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=707.34s)]
*  They always come back home. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=709.22s)]
*  Who talks like that about people? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=711.5s)]
*  They don't even try to earn the black vote. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=714.0200000000001s)]
*  They scold, bribe, try to smoke them up. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=716.26s)]
*  And if you don't come back home quick, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=720.46s)]
*  they're gonna send Don Lemon to chase you down. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  Tough conversations are just that, tough. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=725.7s)]
*  And people don't wanna hear them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=729.38s)]
*  Sometimes people need to be chastised, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=730.82s)]
*  You don't want your message to bounce off. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=733.58s)]
*  I don't think that all the blame should be put on black men, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=735.66s)]
*  but the black men that I have spoken to [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=739.42s)]
*  and I continue to speak to on a daily basis, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=741.3s)]
*  come up with these excuses [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=744.1s)]
*  and these reasons that are just inaccurate. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=746.46s)]
*  They're just plain wrong. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=749.74s)]
*  There are three excuses. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=750.98s)]
*  One is misinformation, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=752.22s)]
*  Two is the media ecosystem, what media you're consuming. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=755.42s)]
*  And three is that perhaps you are just, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=759.14s)]
*  perhaps you are a misogynist. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=762.26s)]
*  Barack gave the media the green light [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=764.9s)]
*  to rough up black voters [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=767.14s)]
*  and Don Lemon is coming in hot with an open hand. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=768.54s)]
*  He has appointed himself the black vote enforcer. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=772.22s)]
*  You can do this the easy way or the hard way. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  And Lemon prefers the hard way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=778.78s)]
*  MSNBC is bringing out the heavy guns. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=781.66s)]
*  Joy Reid is gonna snatch you up by the throat. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=783.78s)]
*  And if you don't vote Democrat, you ain't black, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  you're sexist and you're a fascist. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=789.26s)]
*  Have you noticed how sharply the polls have shifted [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=793.1s)]
*  in Trump's favor over the last couple of weeks? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=796.3s)]
*  With these claims that Trump is surging [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=799.18s)]
*  with black and Latino voters [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=801.14s)]
*  and leading in every single swing state [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=802.66s)]
*  according to secret internal polls, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=805.62s)]
*  despite all the Hitler talk. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=808.06s)]
*  Yes, this race will be far too close [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=810.9399999999999s)]
*  because unfortunately we do have a fascist groundswell [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=814.38s)]
*  in parts of this country, mainly among white men, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=817.66s)]
*  let's be clear, but in small pockets [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=820.54s)]
*  among black and brown men too. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  This happens to be a global phenomenon [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  as women become more economically independent [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=828.26s)]
*  and seek positions of power. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=830.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=832.4599999999999s)]
*  All right, so fascist, sexist, race trader. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  What else are we missing here? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=837.62s)]
*  This election is gonna be no different. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=839.9s)]
*  They've already started [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=842.06s)]
*  with the misinformation and the lies. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=843.18s)]
*  We know that there is foreign interference [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=846.4599999999999s)]
*  and I have to say to everybody listening to this, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=848.26s)]
*  don't let them take your voice [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=852.22s)]
*  because I was part of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=856.66s)]
*  when we investigated Russia's interference [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=860.8199999999999s)]
*  in the 2016 election. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  Black folks were targeted with misinformation. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=864.5s)]
*  Ah, black men are sexist, fascist, Russian puppets. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=869.14s)]
*  Got it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=873.58s)]
*  But white dudes for Harris, they're sexy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=874.9s)]
*  Don't you wanna be sexy? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=877.94s)]
*  And when all else fails, you go to Old Faithful, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=880.3000000000001s)]
*  scare them back home. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=884.1s)]
*  They can't stop blacks from voting anymore [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=886.3800000000001s)]
*  the way they did in the 60s with the same kind of success. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=888.34s)]
*  What they wanna do is they wanna win the election night [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=891.46s)]
*  until the inauguration. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=894.98s)]
*  And if they can go in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=896.7800000000001s)]
*  and they can violently disrupt these counting centers, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=898.0200000000001s)]
*  how will states be able to certify elections? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=901.7800000000001s)]
*  You burn down a county center in Arizona, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=904.7800000000001s)]
*  how does the governor certify those elections? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=906.74s)]
*  What world do we end in? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=909.14s)]
*  Democrats know their party can't function [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=911.54s)]
*  when people or groups think or act independently. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=913.7s)]
*  The machine is designed to enforce blind loyalty [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=917.38s)]
*  and unquestioning faith. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=920.3s)]
*  Persuasion, not part of the equation. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=922.54s)]
*  Your edict is you're either with us 100% [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=925.58s)]
*  or we're gonna make your life miserable. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=929.1s)]
*  You swallow every hoax, follow every order, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=931.3s)]
*  lie for us and nod your head yes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=933.54s)]
*  Anything besides that, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=936.26s)]
*  you have to go see Don and Joy in the dungeon. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=937.86s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal frames Kamala's pitch [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=941.02s)]
*  to black voters as you're either a bad person [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=943.42s)]
*  or you're just stupid. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=947.3s)]
*  Quote, are you an immoral bigoted person? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=949.18s)]
*  One of those notoriously misogynistic black men [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=952.74s)]
*  who can't stand uppity women or a white racist [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=955.54s)]
*  who hates foreigners? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=958.42s)]
*  Or are you a dupe easily misled by misinformation? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=960.5s)]
*  When you don't like liberal ideas [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=965.34s)]
*  because you've seen the results, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=967.46s)]
*  Democrats don't try to get better results. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=970.02s)]
*  They just hate you for pointing out they're failing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=973.42s)]
*  See, loyal Democrats are supposed to pretend not to notice. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=976.46s)]
*  Everyone else gets ridiculed into submission. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=980.74s)]
*  In 2008, Obama called rural America bitter clingers. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=984.22s)]
*  In 16, Hillary called them a basket of deplorables. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=988.86s)]
*  In 2020, Biden called you a threat to democracy. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=993.3s)]
*  And now Democrats are calling their own voters [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=997.1s)]
*  who they think they own sexist Russian plants. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1000.3399999999999s)]
*  But here's the catch. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1004.8199999999999s)]
*  The media is amplifying the Democrats [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1006.06s)]
*  attacking their own side. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1008.3s)]
*  Democrats expect to be criticized by Republicans, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1010.8199999999999s)]
*  but not by other Democrats. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1013.98s)]
*  It stings, especially after the Democrats [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1016.06s)]
*  have done very little for black America in the last decade, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1018.66s)]
*  adding insult to injury. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  When the machine loses control, it can't operate. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1024.1399999999999s)]
*  Everything needs to be clicking on all cylinders. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1027.22s)]
*  It's not. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1030.1s)]
*  Biden should have lost the election honorably, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1031.42s)]
*  and the machine would have been able to regroup [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1034.62s)]
*  for the next cycle. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  But Democrats can't accept not being in power. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1037.98s)]
*  And therefore, they had the coup and the Kamala coronation. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  Both acts of desperation have exposed the party's [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1045.54s)]
*  dark underbelly for the whole country to see, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1049.14s)]
*  and is turning off more Democrats [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1052.74s)]
*  more than any Biden loss would have. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1057.7800000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has opened up a wide lead [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1059.1000000000001s)]
*  in the betting markets, bigger than I thought possible. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1061.42s)]
*  Plus, Barstool founder Dave Portnoy is out [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1064.38s)]
*  with an epic takedown of Kamala Harris, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1067.8600000000001s)]
*  and our own Harris Falkner will join us [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1070.38s)]
*  with an exclusive preview of her town hall [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1072.5800000000002s)]
*  with former President Trump that'll air tomorrow, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1076.46s)]
*  and we'll have a preview of that right here [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1079.34s)]
*  on the Fox News channel, but we begin [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1080.18s)]
*  with something different tonight. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1081.02s)]
*  I want you to close your eyes for a second. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1082.02s)]
*  Not deep meditation, maybe deep prayer, if you want. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1085.34s)]
*  But try to imagine something actually pretty horrible. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1089.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, this time next year, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1092.66s)]
*  President and Vice President in the White House. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1096.26s)]
*  Because here's a preview of what life would be like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1099.34s)]
*  in America, especially if they were to pass [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1101.86s)]
*  their very radical and extreme agenda, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1104.42s)]
*  you know, like the Green New Deal. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1106.7s)]
*  First government spending and inflation will be worse [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1108.8600000000001s)]
*  than anything you have ever seen. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1111.6200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris made a lot of promises with your money. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1113.42s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1116.5s)]
*  That includes more than a trillion dollars [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1118.06s)]
*  in so-called student loan forgiveness, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1120.22s)]
*  $25,000 to first-time home buyers, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1122.06s)]
*  and that is only the beginning. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1124.78s)]
*  And then yesterday, because of the polls [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1126.74s)]
*  where she's lagging in terms of demographically [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1128.76s)]
*  African-American men in this country, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1131.9s)]
*  she announced another 20 billion in forgivable loans [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1134.58s)]
*  to African-Americans to be handed out on the basis of race. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1137.46s)]
*  And today, while speaking with Charlemagne the God, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1141.4199999999998s)]
*  well, Kamala considered, you know, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1145.1s)]
*  promised to consider a multi-trillion dollar [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1147.3s)]
*  reparations plan. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1150.1799999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1152.02s)]
*  I am running to be a president for all Americans. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1153.46s)]
*  That being said, I do have clear eyes [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1156.58s)]
*  about the disparities that exist [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1163.58s)]
*  meaning history, to your point. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1166.22s)]
*  So my agenda, well, first of all, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1169.26s)]
*  on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1171.58s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1173.86s)]
*  And I've been very clear about that position. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1175.22s)]
*  Now, she said this in the past. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1178.5s)]
*  Nobody's ever asked her before. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1179.78s)]
*  There is no amount of your money [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  that Kamala will not spend to win a few votes. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1183.54s)]
*  And of course, the Harris campaign is also promising [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1187.1799999999998s)]
*  to sweeten the deal with a different kind of green, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1189.6999999999998s)]
*  if you will. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1192.4s)]
*  As the New York Post put it, quote, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris urging African-American men [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1195.3200000000002s)]
*  to vote for her to legalize weed, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1198.1200000000001s)]
*  despite convicting herself 1,900 people as DA. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1200.02s)]
*  And as we have reported from day one, Kamala Harris [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1205.0400000000002s)]
*  is the single most radical extreme candidate [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1207.9s)]
*  to ever run for president as a major party nominee. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  So expect to see a lot more stories like this one. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1214.5600000000002s)]
*  Pay close attention. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  Transgender yacht killer serving a life sentence [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1218.8s)]

*  thanks to Kamala Harris. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1226.12s)]
*  This is not a made-up story. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1227.96s)]
*  It is not AI-generated. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1229.5s)]
*  It is not fake news. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1231.24s)]
*  It is not a cheap fake. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1232.52s)]
*  This murderer killed two grandparents on their boat [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1234.04s)]
*  by tying them to the vessel's anchor, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1236.76s)]
*  throwing them overboard before, quote, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1239.28s)]
*  grabbing a beer from the fridge and starting to fish. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1241.16s)]
*  And according to court records, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  this was all part of an elaborate scheme [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1245.44s)]
*  to steal and launder enough money [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1247.82s)]
*  to pay for a sex change operation. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  And thanks to the policies set by Kamala Harris, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1252.4199999999998s)]
*  she said it in her own words on tape, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  and we know she's out there taking this position [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1257.3s)]
*  for many years, during her time as California's AG, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1260.32s)]
*  this killer's wish was in fact granted [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  after murdering two people. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  According to a letter obtained [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1268.22s)]
*  by the Washington Free Beacon, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1269.74s)]
*  this convicted killer claimed, quote, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1271.56s)]
*  I did receive gender-affirming surgery [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1273.54s)]

*  sex change operations for inmates, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1286.22s)]

*  going to sex change operations [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1292.2s)]

*  Many with terror ties, many with criminal backgrounds, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1301.34s)]

*  Have they ever heard of parental rights? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1319.62s)]
*  And a brand new Trump campaign ad points this out. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1321.68s)]
*  It is so insane, it's almost hard to believe, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1325.08s)]
*  but it's real, take a look. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1329.22s)]
*  Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1331.28s)]
*  Surgery. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1334.64s)]

*  How about we just enforce the immigration laws [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  and secure the border, and if you murder two people, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1348.0400000000002s)]
*  you don't get a taxpayer-funded sex change operation. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1351.2800000000002s)]
*  Seems pretty simple, seems pretty logical, right? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1354.24s)]
*  Well, apparently it was just too difficult [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  for the borders are, allowed these millions and millions [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1360.0s)]

*  including known terrorists, but we don't know where they are, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1365.64s)]
*  and people that were known murderers, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1368.76s)]
*  and look at all the dozens of Americans murdered, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1370.9s)]
*  dozens of Americans, including children, raped, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1373.3600000000001s)]
*  hundreds of Americans victims of violent crime. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  We have allowed gang members, drug cartels, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1379.0400000000002s)]
*  into the country, and as I said, people with terror ties [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1381.28s)]
*  from countries like Iran and Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  Venezuela, China, and Russia. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  In Boston, ICE detained an illegal alien [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1391.62s)]

*  deported under Donald Trump. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1396.8999999999999s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1398.7399999999998s)]
*  He came right back into the country under Harris and Biden, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1399.58s)]
*  was arrested for trafficking more fentanyl, carjacking, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1402.54s)]

*  And right here in the free state of Florida, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1408.2199999999998s)]
*  three Biden-Harris unvetted illegals, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1410.1s)]

*  They also crossed over from the wide open southern border [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1415.86s)]
*  of your borders are Kamala Harris, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1419.36s)]
*  and if Kamala gets elected, this crisis, you can bet, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1422.46s)]
*  will get worse. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1424.42s)]
*  Border patrol officers, they are now reportedly planning [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1425.26s)]
*  to quit in droves if Kamala wins. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1428.18s)]
*  Look at these quotes from some of these people [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  that work on the border in the New York Post. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1433.26s)]

*  and if Trump wins, they're gonna stay.'" [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1448.02s)]
*  What does that say? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1451.3s)]
*  They want the support of the American people [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1452.1399999999999s)]
*  to do the job they were hired to do. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1454.06s)]
*  After all, what is the point of having a border patrol [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1456.6599999999999s)]
*  if there's no borders and they're wide open? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1460.34s)]
*  Now these are serious issues that are frankly [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1462.54s)]
*  national security issues at this point. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1465.34s)]
*  And we have known terrorists in the country [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1467.62s)]
*  and murderers and rapists and other criminals [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  and drug cartels and gang members, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1472.02s)]
*  and the American people have every right [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1474.24s)]
*  to be worried about all of it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1475.8999999999999s)]

*  Martha Raddatz, not one taken over by Venezuelan gangs. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1480.22s)]
*  And maybe somebody can help Martha do a little research [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1484.34s)]
*  and maybe ask Kamala Harris what she would say [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1488.2s)]

*  the mother of five, and little 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1494.98s)]
*  and the others murdered by alleged, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1499.32s)]
*  unvetted Harris-Biden illegals. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1502.06s)]
*  There shouldn't be a single convicted killer, terrorist, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1504.6000000000001s)]
*  or any such person in this country that is not vetted. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1508.84s)]
*  This shouldn't be allowed into our country, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1514.22s)]
*  let alone thousands. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1515.9599999999998s)]
*  The American people deserve real solutions [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1517.54s)]
*  to the very real crisis that are impacting small towns [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1519.84s)]
*  and big cities across the country. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1523.1999999999998s)]
*  Instead, the Harris campaign has been rolling out [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1525.1599999999999s)]
*  cheap gimmicks, taxpayer-funded, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1527.48s)]
*  no, where I grew up they'd call it bribery, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1529.84s)]
*  but I would never use that word. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1532.12s)]
*  And Kamala's weird running mate, of course, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1533.72s)]
*  assistant volunteer coach that claims to be the coach, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1536.96s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1540.04s)]
*  And after spending the weekend pretending to hunt pheasants [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1541.0s)]
*  with a shotgun, and he was having a very hard time loading, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1543.6799999999998s)]
*  well, today Tim Walz stepped up to the podium [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1547.06s)]
*  in a crisp new flannel shirt, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1549.24s)]
*  accused JD Vance of faking his real life story. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1551.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1556.2s)]
*  Senator Vance, he became a media darling. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1557.52s)]
*  He wrote a book about the place he grew up, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1560.12s)]
*  but the premise was, was trashing that place [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1563.72s)]
*  where he grew up, rather than lifting it up. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1565.92s)]
*  This guy's a venture capitalist, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  cosplaying like he's a cowboy or something. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1570.2s)]
*  I don't even know what a venture capitalist does [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1573.0800000000002s)]
*  most of the time, because folks who go to work every day, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1575.24s)]
*  they're the ones that are saying, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1579.0s)]
*  what are you going to do with the policies [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1580.24s)]
*  to make my life a little better? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1582.0s)]
*  You don't know what a venture capitalist does. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1584.72s)]
*  You have no business being the vice president. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1587.3200000000002s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, as a young man, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1589.5600000000002s)]
*  Tim Walz spent a lot of time, well, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1591.4s)]
*  gallivanting around communist China. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1593.48s)]
*  And meanwhile, after growing a poor [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1596.24s)]
*  with a single mother, struggling with addiction, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1598.16s)]
*  well, JD Vance, he enlisted in the US Marines. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1600.64s)]
*  He was deployed to Iraq. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1603.76s)]
*  But unlike Tim Walz, he didn't lie about his rank. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1606.04s)]
*  He didn't falsely claim valor that he didn't deserve, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1609.0s)]
*  and claim he fought in a war zone. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1612.24s)]
*  He actually did. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1614.08s)]
*  Vance used his service to help pay for college, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1615.32s)]
*  ultimately law school at Yale. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1617.72s)]
*  He was then successful in business, got into politics, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1619.72s)]
*  and like so many other Americans, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1622.52s)]
*  he is living the American dream, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1625.24s)]
*  starting really at the bottom, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1627.52s)]
*  which apparently makes Tim Walz very angry and jealous. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1629.96s)]
*  And luckily, in three weeks, you can reject, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1633.4s)]
*  and only you can reject, I'm only one vote. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1636.56s)]
*  You can reject in Georgia, North Carolina, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1639.84s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1643.68s)]
*  in the great state of Nevada, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1648.8s)]
*  you can reject the insane policies, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1650.32s)]
*  the utter incompetence that Walz and Harris represent. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1653.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1657.72s)]
*  It's never enough, is it? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1662.28s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi admitted she hasn't spoken to Joe Biden [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1664.24s)]
*  since helping to force him out of the race. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1667.24s)]
*  To be fair, she can't find the Ouija board. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1670.08s)]
*  It appears that Kamala Harris [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1672.8s)]
*  may actually do Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1676.08s)]
*  Her staff has already submitted a list of demands. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1678.72s)]
*  There's Chardonnay, Pina Grigio, Cabernet, Merlot, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1682.16s)]
*  Xanax, Valium. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1688.48s)]
*  Now normally, Rogan's podcast can last up to three hours. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  Three hours, you say? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1696.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, that gives me enough time to bang eight nannies, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1698.0s)]
*  said one man. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1700.72s)]
*  Oh. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1701.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1704.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris is being accused of plagiarism [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1705.4s)]
*  for one of her books. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1707.6000000000001s)]
*  Experts say you can tell Kamala didn't write it [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1708.8400000000001s)]
*  because it's called Smart on Crime. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1711.2s)]
*  She allegedly lifted passages from a press release, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1716.0s)]
*  an AP report, even Wikipedia. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1718.48s)]
*  Wow, she's sounding more like Joe Biden every day, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1721.0400000000002s)]
*  especially chapter four, which is about her uncle [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1724.5600000000002s)]
*  who was eaten by cannibals. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1726.8400000000001s)]

*  Also ending its run in January, Joe Biden. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1738.16s)]
*  Fun fact, the title Sufs refers to the suffering of men [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1741.16s)]
*  who were dragged along to see this musical. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1747.96s)]

*  Yeah, just ask anyone in a second. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1758.16s)]
*  Yeah, just ask anyone in an elevator with Jerry Nadler. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1760.36s)]
*  He farts a lot. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1763.8s)]
*  We hope they're farts. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1767.1999999999998s)]
*  And two giant pandas are on their way from China [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1770.36s)]
*  to the Smithsonian Zoo as part of a cultural exchange program. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1773.76s)]
*  And because it's an exchange, we've sent them two hippos. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1779.36s)]
*  I'll take it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1782.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1783.96s)]
*  So last week, this is interesting, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1784.96s)]
*  something called the California Coastal Commission [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1787.96s)]
*  rejected SpaceX's request to launch more rockets [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1790.96s)]
*  from the Vandenberg Space Force base, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1794.96s)]
*  which is about 150 miles north of LA. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1797.96s)]
*  The commission claims they're worried [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1800.96s)]
*  about the environmental impact of the space force. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1802.96s)]
*  And they're worried about the impact of the space force. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1805.96s)]
*  The commission claims they're worried [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1809.96s)]
*  about the environmental impact [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1811.96s)]
*  and the sonic booms that ring out for hundreds of miles. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1813.96s)]
*  After all, you wouldn't want to wake up [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1817.96s)]
*  those 180,000 homeless in their tents before noontime, would you? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1819.96s)]
*  But launches like these have been done for the past 70 years, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1824.96s)]
*  not to mention the other sonic booms they allow, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1828.96s)]
*  like letting Eric Swalwell eat bean burritos from Taco Bell. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1831.96s)]
*  The commission's own words prove they're less worried [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1836.96s)]
*  about SpaceX's environmental impact than Musk's social impact. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1838.96s)]
*  Here's Chairwoman Carol Hart. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1842.96s)]
*  Dealing with a company that does not... [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1845.96s)]
*  that is the head of which has aggressively injected himself [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1849.96s)]
*  into the presidential race. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1854.96s)]
*  See, what she should have said was, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1858.96s)]
*  we're dealing with someone who's injected himself [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1860.96s)]
*  into the presidential race who isn't helping the Democrats. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1862.96s)]
*  But see, that would be honest, the trait that most bureaucrats abhor. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1866.96s)]
*  After all, Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1870.96s)]
*  the Soros Foundation funds left-wing DAs left and right, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1873.96s)]
*  and Zuckerberg helped swing an election for Joe in 2020. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1877.96s)]
*  See, they're not mad Musk's a political billionaire. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1882.96s)]
*  They're mad he's not their political billionaire. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1885.96s)]
*  Listen to Commissioner Mike... [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1889.96s)]
*  Oh, thank you. I'll take it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1891.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1897.96s)]
*  Listen to Commissioner Mike Wilson. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1899.96s)]
*  This company is owned by the richest person in the world [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1901.96s)]
*  with direct control over what could be the most expensive [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1905.96s)]
*  global communication system on the planet. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1908.96s)]
*  And just last week, that person was speaking [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1911.96s)]
*  about political retribution on a national stage. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1917.96s)]
*  And it was very glib. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1922.96s)]
*  But yet he was standing next to a person, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1924.96s)]
*  a candidate that openly promotes, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1926.96s)]
*  you know, working to normalize that language. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1929.96s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. Oh. Oh, you poor thing. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1932.96s)]
*  Look, if you're mad at someone normalizing bizarre language, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1937.96s)]
*  arrest Kamala. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1941.96s)]
*  Every speech sounds like she's barfing up a Word of the Day desk calendar. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1943.96s)]
*  Finally, check out this doozy from Commissioner Gretchen Newsom. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1947.96s)]
*  Right now, Elon Musk is hopping about the country, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1953.96s)]
*  spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking FEMA [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1956.96s)]
*  while claiming his desire to help the hurricane victims [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1959.96s)]
*  with free Starlink access to the Internet. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1962.96s)]
*  Hopping? What, did he lose a leg? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1966.96s)]
*  So this adorable creep is actually mocking Musk [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1970.96s)]
*  for helping disaster victims. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1973.96s)]
*  What the fuck has she done? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1975.96s)]
*  Nothing. She's a bureaucrat. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1978.96s)]
*  While she's shuffling papers, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1980.96s)]
*  Musk delivered better Internet access to North Carolina [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1982.96s)]
*  than public libraries have to horny homeless men, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1985.96s)]
*  like Jamie Lissow. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1989.96s)]
*  Now, do any of these bureaucrats really sound [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1992.96s)]
*  like they care about protecting wildlife? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1995.96s)]
*  They wouldn't know the difference between a brown bear and a Brett bear. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1997.96s)]
*  Actually, the only difference is one of them no longer shitting in the woods. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2001.96s)]
*  Now, the only thing they're really protecting is themselves. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2006.96s)]
*  They're angry at Musk for not throwing his intellect [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2009.96s)]
*  and wealth behind their idiot Kamala, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2012.96s)]
*  and they're abusing their power to punish him. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2015.96s)]
*  Now, Musk is vowing to sue the commission for violating his First Amendment rights, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2018.96s)]
*  claiming his words have nothing to do with his rocket launches, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2022.96s)]
*  like Saturday's Record Breaker. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2026.96s)]
*  That was a first. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2035.96s)]
*  Nobody else in history and the history of the world has ever done that. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2037.96s)]
*  Well, I once caught something shaped like a rocket, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2041.96s)]
*  and boy, did the ER have a challenge removing that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2044.96s)]
*  Wasn't even July 4th. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2050.96s)]
*  Fact is, Musk beat NASA with far less employees and cash, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2053.96s)]
*  and he did it with a few more people. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2057.96s)]
*  Now, the only thing that's left to do is to get the money [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2060.96s)]
*  and get employees and cash, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2063.96s)]
*  and he did it while also trying to cure disease, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2065.96s)]
*  protect press freedom, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2068.96s)]
*  and create an army of obedient robots. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2070.96s)]
*  At least I hope they're obedient. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2073.96s)]
*  When I say eliminate doosie, I don't want an argument. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2075.96s)]
*  Musk is changing the world, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2079.96s)]
*  and these bureaucrats think they can get him to shut up? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2082.96s)]
*  They can't, and that drives him crazy, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2085.96s)]
*  because he embraces the call for adventure, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2088.96s)]
*  which is the opposite of a bureaucrat. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2091.96s)]
*  A bureaucrat exists purely to seek comfort, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2094.96s)]
*  building a padded world around him without achieving a f***ing thing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2097.96s)]
*  Once a bureaucrat is born, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2101.96s)]
*  its only goal is to feather its nest before it dies. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2104.96s)]
*  But Musk is the enemy of comfort, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2108.96s)]
*  which is weird for a billionaire. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2110.96s)]
*  In fact, it makes being a billionaire [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2112.96s)]
*  the least interesting thing about him. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2114.96s)]
*  He realizes that becoming comfortable with life [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2117.96s)]
*  makes you a menace to everyone else, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2119.96s)]
*  because when you have no challenges, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2121.96s)]
*  you use that time to infringe on others, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2123.96s)]
*  like a bureaucrat. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2126.96s)]
*  Do bureaucrats ever learn from failure? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2128.96s)]
*  No, they avoid failure by avoiding everything, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2131.96s)]
*  everything worthwhile. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2135.96s)]
*  So when they see someone who chases a challenge, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2137.96s)]
*  they resent him. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2139.96s)]
*  They've given up on their dreams, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2141.96s)]
*  so they expect you to do the same. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2142.96s)]
*  See, for Musk, it's about failure more than success. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2144.96s)]
*  Failure becomes the next challenge, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2148.96s)]
*  which becomes the next opportunity, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2150.96s)]
*  which leads to wisdom. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2152.96s)]
*  Compare that to those who despise him. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2153.96s)]
*  They say it's over political beliefs, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2155.96s)]
*  but it's far deeper. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2157.96s)]
*  They don't have faith in themselves, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2158.96s)]
*  and they hate those who do. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2160.96s)]
*  Now, they could be inspired by him, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2162.96s)]
*  but it's just easier to envy him [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2164.96s)]
*  and become an obstacle to the achievement of others. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2166.96s)]
*  But look, you don't need to agree with his opinions. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2169.96s)]
*  It's a free country. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2171.96s)]
*  You have the right to talk back to him or anybody else. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2172.96s)]
*  But when you try to stifle scientific progress [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2175.96s)]
*  because you hate a candidate, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2178.96s)]
*  you're not the good guys. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2180.96s)]
*  Maybe it should be you that we're launching into space. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2182.96s)]
*  You know, California might look pretty good from up there. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2185.96s)]
