# Alan Dershowitz accuses Michael Cohen of lying on the stand in Trump case
**Fox News:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw)
*  All right. Joining us now with more is Fox News legal analyst, Greg Jarrett, Harvard law professor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=0.0s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz. Professor, let's get your take on where we are in this case, this trial, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=5.12s)]
*  what you thought happened in the courtroom today. Where's the crime and what is the crime? Can you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=10.32s)]
*  please tell me, professor, because I don't know. I've been doing this 60 years and I can't find [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=14.4s)]
*  the crime here. What I can find is a crime committed today in the courtroom by Michael [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=20.8s)]
*  Cohn. He looked the jury in the eye and he lied. They asked him why he tape recorded his client. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=26.72s)]
*  And instead of saying, well, maybe I was afraid, I needed some protection, he made up this whole [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=33.36s)]
*  story about why he did it for a pecker. And nobody is going to believe that. And I think this raises [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=39.44s)]
*  serious ethical problems for the prosecutors. In 60 years of doing this, I have never put a witness [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  like Michael Cohn on the stand because I have ethics and good lawyers don't put people on the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=54.16s)]
*  stand who they know are going to lie either on direct and he lied, I believe, on direct [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  or on cross. And we're going to see lie after lie after lie on cross. And so we see ethical violations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=65.2s)]
*  occurring right in front of us and lies occurring right in front of us. We don't even have to get [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=72.24s)]
*  into the issue that he lied before and he went to jail. He lied right to this jury. And I hope at [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=78.32s)]
*  least the lawyers on the jury will see through it and understand that he's trying to sell this jury [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  a bill of goods. But if you listen to CNN or if you read the New York Times, this was the most [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  compelling testimony you've ever seen in your life. And that's why these trials should be on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=95.28s)]
*  television so we can decide for ourselves who's telling the truth instead of having to understand [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  this evidence through the prism of biased reporting. You know, and by the way, Michael Cohn, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=107.36s)]
*  I would argue, Greg Jarrett, based on the referral by Jim Jordan and James Comer about six other lies [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=114.08s)]
*  that they believe they've identified that he told Congress, he has a real, I guess it personally [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=121.44s)]
*  impacts him whether or not Donald Trump becomes president or not, because those referrals would [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=129.36s)]
*  likely go and be taken seriously if there's a new attorney general, correct or no? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=134.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, at least a half a dozen other notorious lies that any fair and objective [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=141.68s)]
*  Department of Justice would already have arrested him and started the prosecution of him. But I will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  say that Cohen today failed to connect Trump to any crimes and I know that prosecutors know that, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=156.24s)]
*  so tomorrow they're going to try to change things, Sean. Cohen will probably do what he [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=162.24s)]
*  always does best. He'll lie. He'll say, oh yes, Trump ordered me to falsely record these expenses [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=168.16s)]
*  as legal expenses. The trouble is that's going to be a tough sell because today he recounted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=176.96s)]
*  all the legal actions he took that constituted legal expenses. I'm not sure he understood it [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  because he's not a bright guy. The real test for Michael Cohen, Sean, will be cross-examination. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=189.28s)]
*  The defense will spend a full day confronting him with his innumerable lies and then they'll [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=194.88s)]
*  ask the question one by one, were you lying then or are you lying now? And once these jurors, Sean, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=201.36s)]
*  see some of the seething unhinged lunatic rants by Cohen on TikTok, they're going to hate him, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=208.4s)]
*  but the question is do they hate Donald Trump more? Will they acquit because there's no evidence [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=215.12s)]
*  of crimes or convict for purely political reasons? That's what Alvin Bragg is counting on [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=221.12s)]
*  because, Sean, he has no case. I'd like to know too how much time did he spend with the prosecution, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=228.96s)]
*  maybe mock questioning beforehand, prep sessions with them, as Stormy Daniels had admitted. All [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=235.84s)]
*  right, here is my exit question and I don't have a lot of time. What are the odds of either an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=242.32s)]
*  acquittal or a hung jury, Professor? I think the odds of a hung jury are fairly high, but you need [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=249.04s)]
*  three jurors to be hung. If you have one, generally they get talked out of it. So I think there's a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=258.48s)]
*  good chance of a hung jury. Look, there's some chance of an acquittal if these jurors take their [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=264.32s)]
*  obligation seriously, but this is New York and as a CNN commentator said, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=269.52s)]
*  this jury is representative of New York. That's the problem. It's like a white jury in Mississippi [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=274.64s)]
*  being representative of white jurors in the South. Yeah, look, Craig Jarrett will give you the last [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=280.64s)]
*  word. Acquittal, odds, hung jury odds? Alvin Bragg got a political judge who allowed this trial to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=288.4s)]
*  run amok. The jury is likely predisposed against Donald Trump. Best case scenario, hung jury, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=296.64s)]
*  all you need is one. I'd like to believe you're both right. Knowing New York as I do, I don't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=304.56s)]
*  have confidence in either. I can say a hundred percent overturned on appeal. Done. There's no [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  way this will, this can stand if we're going to have a system of justice in this country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=319.12s)]
*  That'll be after the election when it's too late. That's a problem. That's too late. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=324.4s)]
*  Very well said, Professor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsEk5qwG1Fw&t=329.84s)]
