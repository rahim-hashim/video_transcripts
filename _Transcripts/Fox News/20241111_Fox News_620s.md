# Trump ‘border czar’ vows to ‘take the handcuffs off ICE’
**Fox News:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI)
*  All right, Donald Trump's second administration is starting to take shape, and it is full [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=0.0s)]
*  of names you might recognize. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=5.88s)]
*  Lee Zeldin, he's going to be running the EPA. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=7.68s)]
*  Elise Stefanik will be the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Our friend and frequent guest, Stephen Miller, will be the deputy chief of staff for policy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=13.76s)]
*  And just breaking earlier tonight, there are multiple reports out tonight that Florida [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=19.2s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio will be named secretary of state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=24.12s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump is also naming former acting ICE director Tom Homan as the new border czar. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=28.0s)]
*  He will be in charge of securing all of our nation's borders, overseeing what has to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=34.76s)]
*  be the largest deportation operation in American history. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=39.64s)]
*  Now, Tom is an experienced, effective professional. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=43.72s)]
*  Everyone knows he will get the job done, including the left. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=47.88s)]
*  They are absolutely melting down over his appointment, led by the co-hosts of that hit [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  show on ABC Disney, The View. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=56.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  I realized that when he says, yes, families can be deported together, what he is saying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  is that U.S. citizens can be deported. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=66.42s)]
*  What he is saying is, if the parent is undocumented and they have U.S. citizen children or U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=69.1s)]
*  citizen spouse, and you don't want to separate them, then let's deport the U.S. citizens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=75.82s)]
*  When you talk about mass deportations, people think, oh, it's just going to be the criminals. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=82.0s)]
*  There's not enough criminals, aliens in the federal prison system for it to be mass deportations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=86.77999999999999s)]
*  What it means is grandmothers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=94.46s)]
*  What it means is brothers and aunts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=96.3s)]
*  What it means is abuelos y abuelas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=99.02s)]
*  It means dreamers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  It means family members. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=103.1s)]
*  It means your colleagues. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Well, the propaganda war has begun. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=106.74s)]
*  Here with more is America's next border czar. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=110.1s)]
*  Tom Homan is with us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  Tom, welcome back to the program. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=116.1s)]
*  Are you planning on deporting American citizens? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=117.1s)]
*  No, exactly not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=120.5s)]
*  Look, the view is like the island of misfit toys. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=123.22s)]
*  They don't know what the hell they're talking about. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=127.86s)]
*  President Trump has made it clear. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=129.42s)]
*  We will prioritize public safety threats and national security threats first. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=131.22s)]
*  And that's what the focus will be. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=135.1s)]
*  There's over 1.5 convicted criminal aliens in this country with final orders removal [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=137.1s)]
*  that we're going to be looking for. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=141.9s)]
*  There's thousands of gang members. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=143.42s)]
*  Now, I'm going to say if you're in the country illegally, you shouldn't feel comfortable. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=146.1s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=150.18s)]
*  I won't feel comfortable if I'm in the country illegally. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=151.18s)]
*  If I'm in some other country illegally, I'm not going to be comfortable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=152.98s)]
*  You shouldn't be comfortable either because when you enter this country illegally, you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=156.18s)]
*  have committed a crime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=159.82s)]
*  You are a criminal and you're not off the table. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=161.24s)]
*  Cartels, gang members, we have had dozens and dozens of Americans that have been murdered. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=165.1s)]
*  I'll scroll their names again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  We have had dozens of Americans, including children, that have been raped by Harris Biden [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=172.82s)]
*  unvetted illegals. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=177.3s)]
*  We have had hundreds and hundreds of Americans victims of violent crime. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=179.02s)]
*  We have a fentanyl crisis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=183.34s)]
*  We have an opioid crisis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=184.74s)]
*  We have cartels. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=186.54s)]
*  We have gang members. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=187.68s)]
*  We have 13,000 illegal immigrant murderers inside our country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=189.06s)]
*  We have known terrorists inside our country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=193.68s)]
*  We have more than 15,000 convicted rapists and sex offenders inside our country, more [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=196.22s)]
*  than 2,500 kidnappers inside our country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=201.66s)]
*  We're all told more than 400,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including known terrorists. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=205.06s)]
*  They're here, but we don't know where they are. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=212.66s)]
*  How are we going to find them to get rid of them? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  Look, we got it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=219.22s)]
*  ICE is very good at what they do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=222.22s)]
*  We have a targeting system. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=223.94s)]
*  I can't really talk about it on the air because it's law enforcement sensitive, but we're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=225.46s)]
*  going to find them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  We're going to go get them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=230.22s)]
*  I saw today numerous governors from sanctuary states saying they're going to step in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  They better get the hell out of the way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  Either you help us or get the hell out of the way, because ICE is going to do their [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=241.22s)]
*  We're going to take the handcuffs off ICE that the Biden administration put on them [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=242.22s)]
*  and let ICE know what they do best. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=245.33999999999997s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=247.98s)]
*  Back to the viewer, Joe Biden. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  They promised, this administration promised, they're going to concentrate on the criminal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=250.82s)]
*  aliens. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=253.82s)]
*  That was a priority. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=254.82s)]
*  Secretary Mallorca said that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=255.82s)]
*  I looked at the stats today. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=256.82s)]
*  The removal of criminal aliens is down 74% from President Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=258.42s)]
*  We have more criminals here than we ever had. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=264.5s)]
*  So we got plenty of targets out there, and the men and women of this new administration [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=266.7s)]
*  are going to go look for them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=271.42s)]
*  They're going to look for them in sanctuary cities. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=272.86s)]
*  If sanctuary cities don't want to help, get out of the way. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=274.18s)]
*  I'll double the workforce in that sanctuary city. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=276.5s)]
*  We're going to do our job. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=278.98s)]
*  Despite the politics, we're doing it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  So get used to it because we're coming. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=285.42s)]
*  Do you like the idea of maybe giving a grace period where people that did not respect our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=286.82s)]
*  laws, borders, sovereignty, that maybe you give them two or three months and you say [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  you can self-report and we will help deport you, we will send you back to your home country? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=299.54s)]
*  And if you do that, we'll put money in your pocket so you can rebuild your life, which [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=305.26s)]
*  would be a lot cheaper than paying for three nights at a four-star hotel in New York and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=310.62s)]
*  giving them a debit card. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=316.7s)]
*  And in a year, after a year or two years or three years, whatever it is, you can then [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=318.74s)]
*  apply to come into the country legally. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  If you don't self-report, deport, then you will never be given an opportunity at citizenship [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=327.26s)]
*  and when you leave, you will never be invited back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=333.7s)]
*  You will never be able to apply to come into the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=336.12s)]
*  Does that sound like a good idea or no? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=339.54s)]
*  Criminals and gang members get no grace period. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=343.98s)]
*  But while we're out prioritizing the public safety threats and national security threats, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=345.78s)]
*  if you want to self-report, you should self-report because, again, we know who you are and we're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=349.66s)]
*  going to come and find you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=355.78s)]
*  So if you want to self-report, that's fine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=357.14s)]
*  But criminals and gang members, they get no favors from this administration. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=359.3s)]
*  You came to this country legally, which is a crime. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=362.62s)]
*  You committed crimes against United States citizens, some heinous crimes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=364.74s)]
*  You get no grace period. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=368.26s)]
*  So we're coming for you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=369.3s)]
*  But for those others, the non-criminals, you want to self-report, I'm all for it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=370.3s)]
*  Because when they self-report, they can put their orders, put everything in order, their [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  family business, if they got homes or whatever, they can put all of it in order and leave [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  with their family altogether. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  It makes perfect sense for the ones that are not criminals and not criminals. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=385.06s)]
*  How are they going to get home? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  How do they get home? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=390.26s)]
*  Well, the ones who are going to go home, the rest of them won't put on an airplane and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=394.26s)]
*  send them home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=396.26s)]
*  And the ones that want to go home on their own, they found their way across the world [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  to come to the greatest nation on earth and find their way home. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=401.46s)]
*  Either that or I'll give them a free airline ticket that we put them on our airplane and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=404.5s)]
*  we'll take them home. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=408.26s)]
*  Either way, it's up to them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=409.26s)]
*  If we arrest them, they come on our airplane, Sean. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=410.94s)]
*  If they want to go on their own airplane, I welcome it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=414.7s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  If I went down to the border and I had a truck and I picked up people that were known illegal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=419.46s)]
*  immigrants, entered the country illegally, and I put them in the truck and I fed them, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=426.86s)]
*  and I said to them, where would you like to go? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  And they said, this state, that state. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=435.9s)]
*  And I want to drive them to whatever location they were asking for. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=437.86s)]
*  Would I not be guilty of human trafficking? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=442.86s)]
*  Would I not be guilty of aiding and abetting and lawbreaking? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=445.53999999999996s)]
*  In all likelihood, if Harris and Biden, if their DOJ found out I did that, what are the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=449.12s)]
*  odds they would have arrested me and put me in jail for as long as they possibly could, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=455.72s)]
*  probably the rest of my life? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=461.08s)]
*  You'd be arrested in charge of a felony. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=463.0s)]
*  You'd be in violation of Title 8, United States Code 1324, alien smuggling. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=467.36s)]
*  I put a lot of people in prison for that, for violating that statute. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=471.6s)]
*  That's what's supposed to happen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=475.92s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=476.92s)]
*  This administration is complicit in the smuggling of millions of people into this country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=478.2s)]
*  And just the children. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=484.23999999999995s)]
*  We have over half a million children that were smuggled into this country by criminal [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=486.0s)]
*  cartels that this administration released to so-called sponsors. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=489.56s)]
*  A half a million. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=493.23999999999995s)]
*  And they can't find them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=494.88s)]
*  And that's something I want to talk about real quickly. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=496.28s)]
*  President Trump is committed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=498.96s)]
*  This is just not a deportation operation that we're targeting the worst of the worst. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=499.96s)]
*  First, we're going to find those half a million children. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=504.0s)]
*  We're going to save them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=506.12s)]
*  We'll put them back with their families. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=507.12s)]
*  That's what President Trump's committed to doing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  And you're talking about the children that were used by criminal illegal immigrants that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  don't even know these children, and they use them to get into the country. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=516.4s)]
*  We know that's happened on a large scale, correct? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=520.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=524.72s)]
*  Children have been rented by the criminal cartels, the single males, go across the border, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=525.72s)]
*  be released. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=530.96s)]
*  The child goes back, gets re-rented again. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=531.96s)]
*  And we know what happens to these children, Sean. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=533.8s)]
*  Look, the illegal immigrants coming across the border, people need to understand. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=536.0s)]
*  31 percent of women that make their journey get raped by criminal cartels. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=539.4s)]
*  Children get raped. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  I've talked to little girls as young as nine that have been raped multiple times. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  These cartels are animals. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=548.4s)]
*  And that's why President Trump's going to take them off the face of the earth. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=549.92s)]
*  They have killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=552.72s)]
*  And we're going—and President Trump is committed to calling them terrorist organizations [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=556.68s)]
*  and using the full might of the United States special operations to take them out. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=560.56s)]
*  I pray we have known terrorists in this country. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=565.64s)]
*  I believe they're plotting, planning and scheming the next attack on this country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  I pray to God that I'm wrong, Tom. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=573.0799999999999s)]
*  I've known you a long time. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=574.92s)]
*  I don't think I am. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  But I pray that I'm wrong, that they're plotting and planning another attack. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  Harris and Biden aided and abetted in the law-breaking. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=582.12s)]
*  And they do have blood on their hands, because every American that has been murdered and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=586.0s)]
*  raped and a victim of violent crime because of their wide-open borders, that's on them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  If there's a terror attack, that will be on them, too. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan, appreciate you being with us. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=599.52s)]
*  Get ready—by the way, buckle up, because you're going to be called every name in the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=601.6s)]
*  book for doing your job and enforcing the laws of our country. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEHvZ06JDZI&t=604.4399999999999s)]
