# Sean Hannity: This is nothing but shock and awe
**Fox News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are kicking off the week with a jam-packed show coming up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=0.0s)]
*  The borders are Tom Homan, Senator John Kennedy, Senator Ted Cruz, two of our favorite senators, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=5.0s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy and White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt will join us straight ahead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=11.0s)]
*  It was a big day at the White House. In fact, every day is a big day at the Trump White House. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=16.0s)]
*  The flurry of activity from the Trump administration is unlike anything we've ever seen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=21.0s)]
*  We have nothing but shock and awe and the media melting down, Democrats melting down, which makes it fun. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=27.0s)]
*  But make no mistake, we are witnessing what is a transformational presidency in the making. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=32.0s)]
*  According to Donald Trump, border crossings now down 93 percent and he's only getting started. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=39.0s)]
*  In just the past 24 hours, Mexico caved in the face-off of Trump's terror threats, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=45.0s)]
*  agreeing to send 10,000 members of Mexico's National Guard to secure their side of the border, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=51.0s)]
*  crack down on fentanyl and smuggling any illegal immigration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=57.0s)]
*  Canada also caving, little Justin agreeing to list Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=61.0s)]
*  appointing a fentanyl czar and participating in a joint strike forced to combat crime at our northern border, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=68.0s)]
*  which is becoming bigger and bigger every day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=76.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, along the border in our north, you know, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, border patrol agents, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=79.0s)]
*  they apprehended nearly 20,000 illegal immigrants from over 97 different countries last year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=86.0s)]
*  Now, that number is higher than the past 17 years combined. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=93.0s)]
*  But now that Canada and Mexico have agreed to start being good neighbors, the tariffs have been paused for 30 days. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=99.0s)]
*  While more permanent security, economic deals will be negotiated. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=105.0s)]
*  And for the record, we give Canada, why do we give them millions of tax dollars every year? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=109.0s)]
*  Why don't they pay their fair share with NATO? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=114.0s)]
*  And they already charge tariffs on our dairy, our poultry products. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=116.0s)]
*  They won't allow, you know, U.S. seeds to be imported into their country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=121.0s)]
*  Sounds like they already started a tariff war or a trade war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=126.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, for many years, free trade seemingly operated one way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=130.0s)]
*  So, why should the U.S. give Canada tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=134.0s)]
*  protect them with our military, while they contribute a tiny amount to NATO? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=138.0s)]
*  Sorry, little Justin, but this unfairness, on your part, it is coming to an end. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=143.0s)]
*  The days of taking advantage of the American people and their generosity is now over. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=149.0s)]
*  And it's not only Mexico and Canada. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=154.0s)]
*  The left-wing governments in Colombia and Venezuela even, caving to Trump's demands. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=156.0s)]
*  Both countries agreeing to repatriate their own citizens, including, you know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=161.0s)]
*  violent gang members like the Trende Aragua gang and criminals that port across our southern border. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=166.0s)]
*  Venezuela also freeing six American hostages. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=172.0s)]
*  Did we even know they were there? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=177.0s)]
*  Returning them back to the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=179.0s)]
*  By the way, great job, President Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=181.0s)]
*  I know the state-run legacy media mob has all but ignored this success. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=183.0s)]
*  You know, ask yourself, do you think Venezuela would have freed these people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=188.0s)]
*  if Joe was still in office or Kamala won? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=192.0s)]
*  Never happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=195.0s)]
*  Panama also, now they're caving to Donald Trump's pressure, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=196.0s)]
*  offering to end their so-called memorandum of understanding with China [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=201.0s)]
*  and work more closely with the United States. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=206.0s)]
*  Panama canal wouldn't exist without us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=209.0s)]
*  Another massive victory for Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=211.0s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=214.0s)]
*  Denmark is still insisting that Greenland is not for sale, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=215.0s)]
*  but the country is now suddenly open to the U.S. expanding our military presence on the island. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=219.0s)]
*  And by the way, they might be having a referendum there soon, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=224.0s)]
*  and maybe the people get to vote themselves, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=228.0s)]
*  and I'm pretty sure that the U.S. will win that battle. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=230.0s)]
*  And the media also ignoring the fact that President Trump killed many ISIS terrorists in Somalia this weekend. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=233.0s)]
*  Remember, Kamala never wanted you to be, she wanted you to be courageous. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=241.0s)]
*  Never say the word radical Islamic terrorist. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=245.0s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump killed a whole bunch of them without killing a single civilian. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=248.0s)]
*  As it turns out, America has a huge amount of leverage. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=253.0s)]
*  President Trump is not afraid to use it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=256.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=258.0s)]
*  We had a great talk with Mexico, and we had President Scheinbaum is a woman. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=259.0s)]
*  I like her very much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=268.0s)]
*  We've had good relationships, but we have to stop fentanyl from coming in, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=269.0s)]
*  whether I like somebody or not, and we have to stop the illegal aliens from coming in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=273.0s)]
*  Canada is very tough. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=278.0s)]
*  They're very, very tough to do business with, and we can't let them take advantage of the U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=279.0s)]
*  Tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting everything else you want. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=285.0s)]
*  Tariffs for us, nobody can compete with us because we're the part of gold. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=289.0s)]
*  But if we don't keep winning and keep doing well, we won't be the part of gold. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=293.0s)]
*  We won't be the part of gold, and then tariffs won't be so good for us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=297.0s)]
*  But when you're the part of gold, the tariffs are very good. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=301.0s)]
*  They're very powerful. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=305.0s)]
*  While President Trump is reasserting America's dominance on the world stage, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=307.0s)]
*  he is harnessing Doge right here at home to drain the swamp, firing politicized bureaucrats [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=311.0s)]
*  about the DOJ, the FBI, those that weaponized and politicized their institutions, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=317.0s)]
*  is simply being escorted out of the building, as they should be. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=323.0s)]
*  He's also in the process of shutting down U.S. aid. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=327.0s)]
*  Oh, this is freaked out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=330.0s)]
*  Every Democrat funneling billions of tax dollars to left-wing causes all around the globe. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=332.0s)]
*  Where do you see the detailed list we have coming up? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=339.0s)]
*  A complete waste of your hard-earned tax money. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=341.0s)]
*  The president also cutting funding from the dishonest and compromised WHO, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=344.0s)]
*  the World Health Organization, or better known as the COVID propaganda wing for China during COVID-19. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=350.0s)]
*  He pulled the U.S. out of the insane globalist Paris climate accords, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=356.0s)]
*  you know, the ones that designated China and India as developing nations. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=361.0s)]
*  He dismantled DEI programs across the entire federal government, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=366.0s)]
*  and at the same time, President Trump used his emergency powers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=370.0s)]
*  to divert more water desperately needed to Southern California. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=374.0s)]
*  He's done all of this now in just two weeks, as he begins his third week in office. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=378.0s)]
*  And while the state-run legacy media mob of the Democrats erupt into a predictable [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=383.0s)]
*  and entertaining fit of hysteria, can't make it up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=388.0s)]
*  They can't. They have learned nothing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=393.0s)]
*  They just doubled down on dumb and dumber. Take a look. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=395.0s)]
*  You're gutting the FBI? You're firing all these people across, you know, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=399.0s)]
*  possibly one third, one fourth of the workforce? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=404.0s)]
*  And you're most experienced people for political reasons? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=409.0s)]
*  You're doing that. The winner are our enemies, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=412.0s)]
*  those people who seek to do harm to America and to kill American citizens. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=417.0s)]
*  So this is really, it is self-mutilation. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=422.0s)]
*  America is hurting itself. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=425.0s)]
*  We think that it is utterly crazy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=428.0s)]
*  And we're also really, really angry at you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=431.0s)]
*  Trump has done some fairly popular things in his first few weeks in office. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=434.0s)]
*  This is not one of them. No, no, no. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=438.0s)]
*  Horrible, horrible, horrible, to quote Charles Barkley. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=441.0s)]
*  A lot of the things, a lot of people at the Super Bowl have beer and guac. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=445.0s)]
*  All of it comes from Mexico, much of it comes from Mexico. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=450.0s)]
*  And the prices of these things are likely to go up. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=454.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, we have a thug in charge of the United States. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=457.0s)]
*  And if we don't wake up, we may not have a United States, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=462.0s)]
*  because right now he has only been successful in being a divider-in-chief. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=466.0s)]
*  By the way, Chucky, there's plenty of beer made right here in America [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=471.0s)]
*  and lots of guac and avocados from California. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=475.0s)]
*  Have they learned nothing in the past 10 years? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=478.0s)]
*  Do they not understand economic and political leverage? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=481.0s)]
*  I mean, they've watched Donald Trump since 2015. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=485.0s)]
*  They have learned nothing. Apparently not. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=488.0s)]
*  They double down on the same tired hate, hysteria, doomsday predictions, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=490.0s)]
*  smear slander about dictatorship and fascism. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=494.0s)]
*  When Donald Trump says, I'm slapping a tariff on you, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=498.0s)]
*  that is the beginning of a negotiation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=501.0s)]
*  Let me educate you into what the president is thinking and how he thinks. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=503.0s)]
*  It's called the art of the deal. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=507.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is turning into an absolute joke. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=509.0s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=512.0s)]
*  If you're a conservative, you're going to love this, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=514.0s)]
*  because the Democratic Party has now elected people to the left of Joe and Kamala. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=517.0s)]
*  Here are the highlights from this weekend's DNC Forum. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgZCpSKvcM&t=523.0s)]
