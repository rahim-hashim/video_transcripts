# James Comer: This is evidence the Bidens were involved in influence peddling schemes
**Fox News:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs)
*  Thank you for joining me, Chairman Comer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=0.0s)]
*  My first question to you is this. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  James Biden, an important character in all of this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=3.92s)]
*  We know about the $40,000 check from James to Joe. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=6.2s)]
*  I know you've been in talks with his attorney. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=9.8s)]
*  He didn't show up for his date when he was supposed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=11.32s)]
*  to have his deposition. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Do you think he comes before Congress? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=14.36s)]
*  I think James Biden will come before Congress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=18.12s)]
*  I think we'll eventually get Hunter Biden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=21.32s)]
*  Look, we've seen Joe Biden say that anyone who defies [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=23.56s)]
*  a congressional subpoena should be held accountable [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=27.2s)]
*  and they should be locked up. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=29.76s)]
*  So we're gonna see if his attorney general [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  is gonna be as aggressive with the Biden family [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=33.92s)]
*  at defying subpoenas as he was at anyone [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=37.72s)]
*  that was involved in any of the Trump investigations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  But look, this is more evidence every day [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  of the Bidens being involved in schemes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=46.96s)]
*  that involve influence peddling around the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=49.96s)]
*  That's what we found out with the FBI tapes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=52.64s)]
*  that no one knew about until this Washington Post story [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  surfaced on Sunday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=58.28s)]
*  You know, that's interesting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=60.6s)]
*  You said you think you'll get Hunter before Congress. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=62.76s)]
*  You know, he's volunteered to come publicly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=65.24s)]
*  in that open door session, but you think he'll come [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=67.48s)]
*  for his deposition eventually. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=69.48s)]
*  I think he's gonna have to. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=72.72s)]
*  He doesn't have a choice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=73.72s)]
*  This is a credible investigation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=75.16s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Americans are keeping up [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=77.4s)]
*  with this investigation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=80.28s)]
*  The Associated Press, which used to be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=81.56s)]
*  a respectable news outlet, they did have a poll [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=83.64s)]
*  that showed that 70% of Americans believe [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=86.84s)]
*  that Joe Biden did something either illegally [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=88.84s)]
*  or at best unethically with his family's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=91.56s)]
*  shady business schemes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  The American people wanna know what the Bidens did [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=96.28s)]
*  to receive the tens of millions of dollars [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=99.16s)]
*  that they got from our enemies around the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  That's a simple question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=104.36s)]
*  That shouldn't be hard to answer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=105.68s)]
*  And through the course of this investigation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=107.64s)]
*  not only have we found out about the millions of dollars [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=109.4s)]
*  that they'd taken in from foreign nationals, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  we've also found out that they disguised a lot of money [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=113.84s)]
*  as loans. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=117.84s)]
*  There's no record of repayment of any of those loans, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=119.0s)]
*  not only interest payments, but principal payments. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=122.76s)]
*  And if that's the case, then they owe millions more in taxes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=126.56s)]
*  So Joe Biden wants to double the size of the IRS [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=131.16s)]
*  to go after tax sheets. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=134.84s)]
*  He needs to look no further than the Christmas dinner table [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=136.28s)]
*  if he wants to look at a bunch of tax sheets [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=140.68s)]
*  who owe the federal government money. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=143.08s)]
*  I mean, this family continues to think that the law [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=144.36s)]
*  doesn't apply to them, that taxes are only to be paid [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  by the little working people and not the Biden family. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=151.96s)]
*  That's why we're gonna continue with this investigation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=155.08s)]
*  And that's why that we're going to have the Bidens sit down [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  and be deposed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  We have hundreds of substantive questions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  that we need to ask them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think the American people deserve the answers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  And you just said it, look, the American people, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  a vast majority, Chairman Comer, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  believe there is something unethical here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=173.72s)]
*  Now, why do they believe that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=176.08s)]
*  Not because the media has been telling them the truth. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=177.6s)]
*  In fact, the media has been burying all that you found, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=180.32s)]
*  but we brought it here tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=183.08s)]
*  Let's scroll this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=184.52s)]
*  These are 20 pieces of evidence that you have uncovered. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=185.68s)]
*  You can find them on House Oversight Committee's website. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=189.0s)]
*  Devin Archer told you Joe Biden is the brand. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  20 Biden phone calls with business partners, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=194.24s)]
*  the 2014 dinner with business partners, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=196.96s)]
*  the 2015 business dinner with business partners, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=198.88s)]
*  and the list goes on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=202.32s)]
*  So how could the president have told us time and time again [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=204.48s)]
*  he has no involvements with Hunter? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=207.12s)]
*  He said that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=211.0s)]
*  He said he didn't know any of these people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=212.12s)]
*  We found out we knew them all. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=213.92s)]
*  He said he never communicated with these people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=216.16s)]
*  We found out he communicated with every one of them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=218.12s)]
*  All the people that sent the Bidens millions of dollars [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=220.4s)]
*  from around the world, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=223.48s)]
*  who Joe Biden said he never met with, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  he met with them all. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  He talked to him, he had lunch with them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  He spoke to them on the phone. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=228.64s)]
*  They had dinner at Cafe Milano. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=230.4s)]
*  They flew on Air Force Two. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=232.36s)]
*  He has not been truthful with the American people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=233.96s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=236.32s)]
*  This is a simple question. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=237.32s)]
*  What did you do to receive the tens of millions of dollars [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=238.72s)]
*  from our enemies around the world? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=241.36s)]
*  And then if you wanna go further, next question, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=242.56s)]
*  why didn't you pay taxes on it? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=244.68s)]
*  What you're calling loans, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=246.44s)]
*  have you made any payments on these loans? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=248.8s)]
*  Are they loans or did you disguise them as loans [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=251.24s)]
*  so you wouldn't have to report them to the IRS? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=253.76s)]
*  There are so many questions here [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=256.4s)]
*  and you look at the evidence, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=257.72s)]
*  and I appreciate the fact that you showed the evidence [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=259.68s)]
*  on TV when so many in the mainstream media [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  try to say there's no evidence [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=264.2s)]
*  because that's what the White House tells them to say. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=265.48s)]
*  There's mountains of evidence. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=268.04s)]
*  Why has the president not been truthful [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=270.0s)]
*  with the American people? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=272.0s)]
*  What were they doing to receive the money? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=273.16s)]
*  This is an issue of national security [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=274.92s)]
*  and I think every American is concerned [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=276.6s)]
*  that our president is for sale. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=279.36s)]
*  You have the FBI tapes that reveal [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=281.16s)]
*  that Joe, Jim Biden, was trying to do influence peddling [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=283.56s)]
*  with his brother. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=288.04s)]
*  We know that Hunter Biden was trying to do that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=288.96s)]
*  This has been a family business for a long time [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=291.0s)]
*  and it needs to stop and we need to know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=293.32s)]
*  what damage has been done [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  because of the family's influence peddling. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=298.88s)]
*  Final question for you here, Chairman Comer. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=303.0s)]
*  I saw Senator Ted Cruz said that your investigators [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=304.64s)]
*  are working during the holidays. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=307.84s)]
*  What are they up to now? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=309.4s)]
*  We were in Florida today, many of our staff, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=313.84s)]
*  interviewing people that were involved. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=317.6s)]
*  They interviewed the trustee of the AmeriCorps Health [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=319.4s)]
*  debacle. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=323.8s)]
*  This was one of the influence peddling schemes [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=324.64s)]
*  where Jim Biden went to a failing healthcare company [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=326.68s)]
*  and said, if you pay me $600,000, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=330.08s)]
*  I can use my brother's contacts in the Middle East [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=332.76s)]
*  and get you all the money you want. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=335.08s)]
*  They paid him $600,000. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=336.96s)]
*  200,000 of that ended up in Joe Biden's pocket [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=338.88s)]
*  and they ran off. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=341.92s)]
*  They defrauded that healthcare company [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  and Joe Biden was involved in that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=344.48s)]
*  We only got a third of the cut. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  This is an example of what we're gonna be doing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=348.6s)]
*  We're gonna continue to be reviewing emails. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna continue to be reviewing bank statements. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=352.64s)]
*  Bank statements are still trickling in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=354.68s)]
*  because the family had so many shell companies [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=356.32s)]
*  and so many bank accounts. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=358.44s)]
*  So we're gonna work throughout the holidays. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  This is an important investigation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  We're trying to wrap it up. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=363.2s)]
*  And I think that the support is there [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=364.64s)]
*  from the American people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=368.92s)]
*  to get answers to this investigation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZIgkCtNgs&t=370.28000000000003s)]
