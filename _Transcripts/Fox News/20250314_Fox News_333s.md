# Sean Hannity: The Democrats lost again
**Fox News:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY)
*  Yet another big win today for the president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=0.0s)]
*  There will be no Schumer shutdown. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Democrats, they lost again. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=4.84s)]
*  Trump's spending bill got over the 60-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate, thanks to Majority [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=6.84s)]
*  Leader Thune, who worked very hard behind the scenes to make it happen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=11.72s)]
*  That easily passed earlier tonight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=16.68s)]
*  Now, of course, the Democrats were threatening to block the bill, force a government shutdown. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=18.6s)]
*  Chuck Schumer finally surrendered and helped get it across the finish line. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=23.68s)]
*  The Schumer shutdown, we can say tonight, is officially the Schumer surrender. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=28.38s)]
*  And this morning, President Trump actually praised Schumer's courage. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=33.66s)]
*  Not exactly sure he did it out of courage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=37.34s)]
*  It's safe to say that Schumer's courage was more likely political expediency, and it is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=39.58s)]
*  not going over well with the radical left Democratic Party, but he is on record now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=45.86s)]
*  for decades condemning government shutdowns. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=50.28s)]
*  And Schumer's one-time BFF, fellow Biden backstabber Nancy Pelosi, is blasting the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=53.34s)]
*  surrender Schumer and accusing him of buying into a false choice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  Other Democrats were apoplectic as their party is now descending into complete and utter [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=67.06s)]
*  unmitigated chaos. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=72.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=74.14s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, I guess the Senate Democratic leader, your senator, said at this meeting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=75.14s)]
*  that he is going to vote for cloture. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=80.64s)]
*  He is going to vote to allow there to be a simple majority vote. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=82.84s)]
*  You think that's wrong? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=85.92s)]
*  I believe that's a tremendous mistake. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=87.12s)]
*  In this moment, we need to be resolute. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=88.84s)]
*  We need clarity, and we need conviction, and we need unity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=91.08s)]
*  You need to hold the line in the face of this hostile government takeover and stand in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=95.22s)]
*  gap. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=101.0s)]
*  Everything is on the line, so you must do everything. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=102.0s)]
*  Do not cede our leverage in this moment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=105.16s)]
*  The Democrats in the Senate should vote it down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  We should not give a blind check to Elon Musk or President Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=109.84s)]
*  In this parlor game here about, you know, most American people, they can't name us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=113.68s)]
*  They don't know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk and the GOP are planning for them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, I can speak with confidence that the Schumer cancellation countdown clock is officially [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=131.12s)]
*  ticking. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  The fear of circling the wagons at the Democratic Party is now officially over. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump has totally defeated all of them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  Their spirits are clearly broken. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=145.27999999999997s)]
*  They are completely lost. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=147.38s)]
*  In fact, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries doesn't seem to know what to do, what to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=148.76s)]
*  say. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  Couldn't even take a position on Schumer today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=156.64s)]
*  Senator Chuck Schumer is from your state. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=157.64s)]
*  He clearly has a different view of this than you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=159.88s)]
*  He is not saying, let's go back to the negotiating table. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  He's saying, let's take this vote. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=165.04s)]
*  So do you have you lost confidence in him? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=166.4s)]
*  The fact that you guys see this so differently. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=169.6s)]
*  I'm not afraid about anything, anything. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=171.72s)]
*  You meant went to another question. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=175.44s)]
*  Anything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I said I was very clear that we look forward to working with every single one of our Senate [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Democratic colleagues, every single one of them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=185.28s)]
*  Push back against the Trump administration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=190.68s)]
*  Every single one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=192.44s)]
*  If you just said yes to having confidence in him, this would go away in many ways. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=193.48s)]
*  Do you think this is what the American people care about right now? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Isn't that the guy that said earlier in the week that the Republicans were on the run, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=203.2s)]
*  that they were scared of him? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=207.88s)]
*  Well, so after tonight's surrender on the budget battle, what will Democrats do next? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=209.6s)]
*  Will there be more screaming and yelling and singing at press conferences in D.C.? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=214.52s)]
*  Will they spew even more Hitler comparisons? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=219.0s)]
*  Are they going to tell us that the sky is falling yet again because we're cutting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  out waste, fraud and abuse? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  Probably, in all likelihood. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=226.92s)]
*  And according to reports, they are now planning to take this show on the road, and they want [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  to have town halls and Republican districts across the country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  You may want to go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=237.32s)]
*  It might be entertaining. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=238.32s)]
*  You might have a few questions for them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=239.32s)]
*  I would ask that you not be like them and be polite. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=241.2s)]
*  But beware, if you are in a conservative area of the country, which is most of the country, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  a radical Democrat might be coming to a venue near you to spread their message in support [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=249.08s)]
*  of men and their right to play women's sports, for open borders forever, with no deportations, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  even for violent criminals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=260.16s)]
*  They might be spreading the gospel of wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=262.04s)]
*  the Green New Deal, woke DEI, transgender radicalism abroad. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=267.56s)]
*  And of course, they will share a message and the gospel of extreme hatred for all things [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=273.04s)]
*  and Elon Musk. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  That's about all this party represents at this moment in time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=279.64s)]
*  In the meantime, Republicans, led by President Trump, they will continue to work hard for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=283.72s)]
*  you, the American people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=287.8s)]
*  They will work hard to protect your freedoms. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=289.08s)]
*  They want to restore law and order and safety and security. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=291.18s)]
*  They want to fix this broken economy they inherited. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=294.56s)]
*  They want to reduce regulations and being good stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=297.32s)]
*  And yes, restore the FBI to what it once was, the premier law enforcement agency in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=303.32s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=309.12s)]
*  Restore our intel community to what they used to be, the premier intelligence gathering [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=310.8s)]
*  agencies in the entire world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=316.2s)]
*  And the DOJ will not be weaponized any longer. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupbvnWKXtY&t=318.36s)]
