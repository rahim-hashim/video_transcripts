# President Trump: Biden didn't give himself a pardon and it all had to do with him
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec)
*  Joe Biden ran and said he would never do preemptive pardons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=0.0s)]
*  It was an issue that came up when you were leaving your first time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=4.0s)]
*  He heard that I was going to do it. I didn't want to do it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=7.0s)]
*  I was given the option. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=10.0s)]
*  They said, sir, would you like to pardon everybody, including yourself? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=12.0s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to pardon anybody. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=16.0s)]
*  We didn't do anything wrong. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=18.0s)]
*  And we had people that suffered. They were incredible patriots. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=20.0s)]
*  We had people that suffered. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=23.0s)]
*  You had Bannon put in jail. You had Peter Navarro put in jail. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=26.0s)]
*  You had people that suffered. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=30.0s)]
*  And far worse than that, they've lost their fortunes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=33.0s)]
*  They've lost their whatever, their nest egg, paying it to lawyers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=37.0s)]
*  And those people, and people said, do you want, and they don't even, they wouldn't have even taken, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=41.0s)]
*  most of those people, they wouldn't have even taken a pardon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=47.0s)]
*  This guy went around giving everybody pardons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=50.0s)]
*  You know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=53.0s)]
*  And if you look at it, it all had to do with him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAvbdeChec&t=60.0s)]
