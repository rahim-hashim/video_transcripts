# Gov. DeSantis on Hurricane Helene: This is a 'real deal, major hurricane'
**Fox News:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0)
*  The governor of the great free state of Florida, my state, my home state, Ronda [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=0.0s)]
*  Santos, governor, I know Florida has great experience dealing with these [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=4.48s)]
*  hurricanes. But with that said, there's always that danger. You're in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=9.52s)]
*  Tallahassee, you're kind of right, right in the path of where this is coming. And [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=14.68s)]
*  of course, you have a storm center. I tell us the latest that most people [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=18.96s)]
*  that needed to get evacuated get evacuated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=23.2s)]
*  So we have a category four storm. It actually is increased in ferocity to 140 [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=26.52s)]
*  mile per hour sustained wind. So that is a real deal major hurricane. And it's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=35.6s)]
*  also a storm that's very large. And so it is producing really significant wind [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=41.84s)]
*  gusts far away from the eye of the storm. And yeah, we've had storms in the past [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=48.0s)]
*  that have been category five that have been a little bit more compact. This is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=52.8s)]
*  a strong cat for where you're having to see damage spread far and wide. We had [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  been messaging about the storm surge. There were evacuation orders that have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=65.28s)]
*  been put in place county by county in various areas, depending on the threat [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  for really the last couple days. And I know a lot of people heeded those calls. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=76.44s)]
*  So when you're talking about a storm of this magnitude, it is going to produce [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=81.24s)]
*  serious, serious surge in this big bend area. In particular, I heard the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=86.0s)]
*  reporter talk about that east side, the dirty side of the storm. You know, we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=91.2s)]
*  have this thing landfall maybe somewhere in Taylor County, which is southeast of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=95.84s)]
*  Tallahassee. So obviously, where the eye makes a landfall is going to be a big [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=101.0s)]
*  deal. But then everything to the east of that, you're talking about Levy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=106.24s)]
*  County, Dixie County, some of those areas that have already experienced two [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=110.76s)]
*  hurricanes in the last 13 months. They had Hurricane I'd Alia in 2023. And then [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=114.92s)]
*  earlier this year, they had Hurricane Debbie. So this is definitely a major [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  event. But Florida prepares for these things. We have over 30,000 utility [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  workers ready to go. As soon as the storm passes, they're going to be doing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=131.44s)]
*  power restorations. We have all of our search and rescue assets that are ready [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=136.4s)]
*  to go. If there are people that stayed behind and they're in harm's way, as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  soon as it's safe to go, they're going to be there doing that. We even did new [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=144.76s)]
*  innovative things like Uber was providing free rides to people who were [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  going and evacuating to shelters. And so there's been a lot that's been done up [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=152.96s)]
*  to this point. Folks by and large have been very cooperative. And then as soon [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=157.68s)]
*  as the storm passes, you'll see the rescue efforts and the restoration [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=162.24s)]
*  efforts begin as soon as possible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  All right, Governor, we appreciate all your efforts. We'll be monitoring all [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIB3LXwXaR0&t=170.48000000000002s)]
