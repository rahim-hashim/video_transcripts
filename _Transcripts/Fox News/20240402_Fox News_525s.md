# Speaker Johnson RIPS Biden for claiming he never issued Transgender Day proclamation
**Fox News:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48)
*  All right, this weekend, House Speaker Mike Johnson, he joined conservatives all across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=0.0s)]
*  the country condemning Joe Biden's proclamation, declaring Easter Sunday as Transgender Day [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=4.28s)]
*  of Visibility. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=10.4s)]
*  But according to new reporting today, Biden denied, in his own voice, that he ever made [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=11.94s)]
*  the declaration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=16.48s)]
*  He called Speaker Johnson uninformed for his criticism, despite the proclamation actually [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=17.48s)]
*  saying, as Johnson rightly pointed out, that Biden did quote, quote, hereby proclaim March [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=23.44s)]
*  31st, 2024 as Transgender Day of Visibility. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=30.96s)]
*  Here with reaction is the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is with us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he needed any more evidence than what you posted and what we put up on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=40.56s)]
*  the screen, but he just flat out denied that he did it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=44.16s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=47.36s)]
*  Well, it's his own signature on the document. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=49.32s)]
*  That's why we posted it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=52.8s)]
*  The evidence speaks for itself, as we used to say in the courtroom. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=53.8s)]
*  But look, it's highly possible that he doesn't even know what he's signing, Sean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that might be even more alarming. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=60.12s)]
*  But I think this episode highlights what your two previous guests have already said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=61.92s)]
*  I think Vivek and Laura said it very well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=66.44s)]
*  This election is about showing the contrast between these two visions for America. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=68.38s)]
*  And this proclamation on Easter Sunday is just a great example of that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=73.24s)]
*  This radical leftist progressive vision for the country is not who we are as Americans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=77.6s)]
*  And I think most of the country agrees with us, Sean. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=82.88s)]
*  And I think that's why we're going to have a very successful election in November. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  All right, let's look at—I'm not really sure why—maybe I understand why Kevin McCarthy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=88.72s)]
*  resigned, but then you have Bill Johnson resign, Brian Higgins resign, Mike Gallagher is resigning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And your very slim margin, the slimmest of any House speaker in history, has gotten even [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=101.88s)]
*  smaller. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=107.1s)]
*  And look, I feel the same frustration that many other conservatives feel, and that is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=108.74s)]
*  that they want the Republican majority, you know, united on certain principles, like, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  OK, securing the border and balancing the budget, those two things. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=123.94s)]
*  But you can't get that consensus. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=128.18s)]
*  Now, it has now resulted in Marjorie Taylor Greene threatening a motion to vacate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=130.34s)]
*  You apparently have been in conversations with her. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=136.38s)]
*  What is the standing of that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=139.26s)]
*  Yeah, Marjorie and I are going to talk again this week. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=141.06s)]
*  She's frustrated, and we all are, to your point. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  Every conservative is frustrated about our current position. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=148.34s)]
*  We have the smallest majority in U.S. history. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=151.18s)]
*  We have a one-vote margin right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=153.14s)]
*  So it's very difficult to move big things up the field for our principles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  But here's how we're going to do it, Sean. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  This is a very simple formula. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=160.78s)]
*  We will grow the majority in November. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=162.44s)]
*  We'll win back the Senate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=164.5s)]
*  Donald Trump will be a return to the White House. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=166.34s)]
*  If we do a couple of simple things, we have to show what we're for. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=168.02s)]
*  That's what Vivek was saying earlier. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=171.46s)]
*  He's exactly right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=172.74s)]
*  That's what we've been saying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=173.74s)]
*  You know, I talk a lot about the seven core principles of American conservatism. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=174.74s)]
*  It's individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=178.34s)]
*  responsibility, free markets, human dignity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=182.86s)]
*  These are the things that made America the most exceptional nation in the history of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  We're for those foundational principles, and the Democrats, the progressives, are not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  So we've got to talk about what we're for. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  And also, to your point, we've got to unify. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=194.66s)]
*  When you have such a small majority, if the Republicans will stand together, we have much [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=197.12s)]
*  better, obviously, negotiation strength when we're dealing with Democrats in the Senate [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=200.76s)]
*  and a Democrat in the White House. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=204.5s)]
*  And finally, we've got to move our conservative agenda, at least incrementally. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=206.1s)]
*  And we can do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=210.3s)]
*  We can show the American people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=211.3s)]
*  We can fight on these things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=212.54s)]
*  Look, we're for standing up to China and securing the border and protecting American jobs and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=213.7s)]
*  unleashing American energy and changing the budgeting and spending habits of Washington. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=218.34s)]
*  But it takes every single Republican in the House to stand together to do that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=222.78s)]
*  And I think now people feel the gravity and the weight of this, the importance of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=226.46s)]
*  And I think we're going to do that in the days ahead. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=229.78s)]
*  It's a long time to November, but it'll be here before you know it, and it can't get [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=231.66s)]
*  here soon enough. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=235.02s)]
*  All right, let's talk about the status with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=236.02s)]
*  And Frank, I'm going to be very frank. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=241.18s)]
*  I understand her frustration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  I understand Chip Roy's frustration, Freedom Caucus members' frustration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=243.9s)]
*  If I had to guess, you share it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=248.84s)]
*  Now, my understanding is that there were 40 or 50 Republicans that would not go along [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=250.66s)]
*  with the Republican plan to fight back and stay united. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=257.98s)]
*  Was the number really that high? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  And what is the status of your discussions with Marjorie? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=265.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're referring to our procedural rules on the floor. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=268.74s)]
*  We've had 47 Republicans, House Republicans, over this Congress over the last year and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=274.34s)]
*  four months, who have decided that at various times they'll vote against our own procedural [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=280.42s)]
*  rules on the floor. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=284.3s)]
*  Not to get too deep in the weeds of process, but that really matters, because if you can't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=285.3s)]
*  pass your own rule on the floor, it means votes have to be passed by suspension, which [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=289.46s)]
*  is two-thirds of the House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=292.9s)]
*  Remember, with a one-vote margin, that means by necessity on must-pass legislation, like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=294.34s)]
*  funding the government, you've got to get Democrat votes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=298.94s)]
*  And that's why everybody's so frustrated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=300.86s)]
*  So in some ways, we're sort of doing this to ourselves, so we've got to get everybody [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=302.7s)]
*  together. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=306.14s)]
*  I think all of our colleagues recognize that we can't have a distraction right now, that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=307.18s)]
*  we've got to keep the team together, and I think we will. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=311.74s)]
*  I'll talk with Marjorie about her frustrations, and she knows I share them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=314.9s)]
*  I'm a lifelong movement conservative, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=319.5s)]
*  We want to do big things, and we're going to fight every single day with every inch [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=322.34s)]
*  of ground that we can for the American people, for what they want. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=326.14s)]
*  And when we're delivered a bigger majority in November, which we will be, Senate, White [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=329.14s)]
*  House return, we're going to turn this thing 180 degrees, and we can fix all these problems. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=332.7s)]
*  And we've got to show the American people that we're willing to do that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=336.98s)]
*  Well, our very own Chad Pergram, who knows all things Hitchhiker's Guide to All Things [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=339.98s)]
*  Congress, is rightly pointing out, with the thin margin that you have, there is a risk [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=344.7s)]
*  here, that this would be, I think, the first time in history that a sitting speaker could [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=350.06s)]
*  actually be switched in midterm. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=356.14s)]
*  I mean, is there really a possibility that Hakeem Jeffries could emerge a winner in this, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=358.86s)]
*  if in fact that action is taken? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=364.58s)]
*  Look, that's a risk, but I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=367.94s)]
*  Marjorie filed a motion to vacate not in a privileged form, which means it doesn't come [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=371.94s)]
*  up automatically. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=375.02s)]
*  She's trying to send a message. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=376.02s)]
*  I respect the message. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=377.5s)]
*  I share her, again, her frustration about the process. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=378.94s)]
*  But the way for us to fix that is to grow the House majority. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=383.5s)]
*  And the way to do that is to stand united together on the agenda going forward. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=386.38s)]
*  So we're going to have everybody working together. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=389.94s)]
*  We'll work on consensus and keep this team. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=391.5s)]
*  Marjorie knows how high the stakes are for the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=394.62s)]
*  We all do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=398.46s)]
*  And that's why it's never been more important for us to stand together, and I think we will. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=399.46s)]
*  I think all our colleagues understand that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=402.58s)]
*  We're going to get through this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=404.18s)]
*  Hakeem is not going to be the speaker, and we'll take care of business. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=405.18s)]
*  We'll do it for the American people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  So I think the big takeaway for me is that I think we need more conservatives in the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  Republican Party elected to the House, number one. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=416.7s)]
*  Number two, I think the small majority has to stick together. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=421.1s)]
*  I wouldn't want your job. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=425.62s)]
*  I've had at-length discussions with former Speaker Newt Gingrich about this very issue. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=426.98s)]
*  And to be honest, I mean, he says it's almost job impossible at this point, because you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=432.18s)]
*  have varying factions within your coalition, in your majority, that is very slim. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=437.74s)]
*  And unless everybody agrees, you can't really accomplish the things you want to accomplish. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=444.22s)]
*  Now, I say that to the American people because they need to be aware that House elections [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=450.14000000000004s)]
*  really matter. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=455.82000000000005s)]
*  And the size of a majority really matters. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=457.62s)]
*  If you have a 30-seat majority, you can get a lot more done than you can with, you know, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=460.82000000000005s)]
*  a 3-seat majority or a 2-seat majority, whatever it ends up being in the end. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  So I think that's very critical. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=470.74s)]
*  Tell us about the efforts that you will be involved in to help elect Republican House [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=473.1s)]
*  members. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=477.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's great, Sean. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=478.26s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=480.62s)]

*  We've recruited strong conservative candidates who can help us turn this mess around, and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=490.74s)]
*  they're running very strong. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=496.02s)]
*  We're going to win this election cycle. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=497.14s)]
*  We're going to have a comfortable margin. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=498.5s)]
*  Even the pollsters are saying that now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=499.94s)]
*  But we've got to stick together and get this through the finish line. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=501.38s)]
*  We'll finish strong for the people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=503.74s)]
*  We'll keep fighting every single day. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2yYIY5vp48&t=504.94s)]
