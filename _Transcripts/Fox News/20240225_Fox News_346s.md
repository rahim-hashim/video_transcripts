# Vivek Ramaswamy: This isn't the American dream, it's the American nightmare
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU)
*  All right, so as the fallout continues from the massive civil fraud ruling against former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump in New York, Attorney General Letitia James, she is now openly gloating [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=5.8s)]
*  about seizing Trump properties if he has any issues paying the nearly half a billion dollar [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=11.3s)]
*  fine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=16.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=17.52s)]
*  Insisting she will collect that civil fraud fine even if it means seizing some of his [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=18.52s)]
*  assets. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=22.88s)]
*  We are prepared to make sure that the judgment is paid to New Yorkers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=23.88s)]
*  And yes, I look at 40 Wall Street each and every day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=29.0s)]
*  But the former president seems undeterred, as usual. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=32.96s)]
*  Instead, he's focusing on the campaign ahead, including the South Carolina primary coming [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=35.6s)]
*  up on Saturday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  We will be in South Carolina this week here with reaction former presidential candidate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=45.8s)]
*  He's been stumping for the president in South Carolina all day today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=46.8s)]
*  You know, I look at this and, you know, you think of a state like New York, Vivek, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=52.08s)]
*  here's a state where we have on videotape two examples of the cops getting the living [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=57.8s)]
*  Adam ship kicked out of them by illegal immigrants. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=62.4s)]
*  The first group of people, they go to jail, they get out no bail, they head out to the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=65.92s)]
*  state of California, the sanctuary state of California for free healthcare. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=71.2s)]
*  No consequences. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=75.4s)]
*  In this case, nobody got harmed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  You have a disclaimer to saying, don't go by our valuations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=79.0s)]
*  We have a judge that values Mar-a-Lago at 18 million, and here we are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=83.52s)]
*  Are you next? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  We have Ron DeSantis come out? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Is he next? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=91.64s)]
*  Because I don't think either one of you are liked by the media mob either. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=92.64s)]
*  Me too, just for the record. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=95.6s)]
*  Yeah, so you show me the man, I'll show you the crime. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=97.36s)]
*  That was a famous saying from Stalin's chief of police. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=99.96s)]
*  That's how the prosecutorial system is now working against Donald Trump today. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Not only was this not a victimless crime, Sean, you want to think about the people who [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=107.6s)]
*  did business with Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  They made money off of those interactions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=112.88s)]
*  Not just average consumers, but financial institutions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=115.36s)]
*  So for her to bring this case, I think is a legal and unconstitutional violation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=118.36s)]
*  And when that's overturned on appeal, she's now talking about seizing Trump's residences [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  and real estate properties. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=127.52s)]
*  I want to know what property of Letitia James is going to be seized when this is overturned [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  on appeal for the damage this is doing to our country and to trust in the standard of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=133.44s)]
*  the rule of law in the United States of America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=138.28s)]
*  We need accountability when this is overturned on appeal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=140.92s)]
*  But for now, I'll say this is a travesty of justice and this should not happen in the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=143.64s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=147.48s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=149.48s)]
*  And this is now getting to the heart of where we are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=150.48s)]
*  I mean, we're now criminalizing political differences. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  We've weaponized justice in America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=156.72s)]
*  There's a two-tier justice system. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=159.48s)]
*  You can see that certainly in the documents case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=161.04s)]
*  Top secret classified information, Hillary's servers, deleted subpoena emails, broken devices, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=164.22s)]
*  bleach bit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=170.72s)]
*  Then you have Joe Biden, four separate locations, no raids, no charges, nothing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=171.72s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=178.04s)]
*  What has happened to this great constitutional republic that is supposed to be governed by [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=179.44s)]
*  equal justice under the law and equal application of our laws? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=186.24s)]
*  Every American should fear this regardless of where they stand politically. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=190.24s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=194.28s)]
*  This isn't the American dream. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=196.6s)]
*  This is the American nightmare. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=197.82s)]
*  And this is not even about Donald Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=199.36s)]
*  It's about every other American at home who's now at risk of prosecutorial abuse as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  I think one of the great things that happened for this country was in the last week, seeing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=206.96s)]
*  Fannie Willis actually testify in that case, Sean. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=210.58s)]
*  There the American public was able to see bare. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=214.24s)]
*  These are the people who are actually pursuing these cases against Donald Trump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=216.84s)]
*  People have no idea about basic geography or the basic idea or the understanding of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  the law as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=225.72000000000003s)]
*  These are not the people that our founding fathers envisioned should be in charge of, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=227.24s)]
*  let alone prosecuting a former president of the United States and somebody who's running [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  for president of the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  They're rolling over in their graves. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  We're supposed to be a country where regardless of your skin color and, yes, regardless of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=239.0s)]
*  your political belief, there is one standard of the rule of law in the United States of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  America. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=247.84s)]
*  And I'm grateful that Donald Trump is standing strong, that he's actually said it beautifully [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=248.84s)]
*  the other night. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  John Fox on the town hall, he said it, you know what my vengeance will be? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=253.9s)]
*  Success will be my vengeance. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=257.78s)]
*  There's a trap to try to bait somebody, to come after them in so many different directions [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=259.54s)]
*  that you get them to crumble or to make a mistake. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=263.42s)]
*  I'm glad to see him going in the other direction to say that, you know what, we're going to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=265.54s)]
*  chase success. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=269.18s)]
*  Success is unifying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=271.04s)]
*  Success is how we win. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=272.46s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=273.46s)]
*  I have full confidence that that's exactly what's going to happen this November, even [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=274.46s)]
*  though they've created a complicated path to get there. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=277.7s)]
*  Tell me why you're so confident that will happen. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=280.86s)]
*  Well, look, at the end of the day, I do have confidence in the American people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=283.42s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=288.58s)]
*  Fool me twice, shame on me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=290.02s)]
*  I was just in South Carolina today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=291.54s)]
*  The enthusiasm for Trump was palpable, but the enthusiasm for this country was palpable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=293.44s)]
*  People in this country realize we live in a 1776 moment right now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=298.92s)]
*  We talked about our founding fathers and setting into motion one standard of the rule of law. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=303.38s)]
*  This is a 1776 moment today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=307.74s)]
*  And I think people across this country, I hope people watching at home, feel that sense [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  of responsibility. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=313.42s)]
*  It's not just another ordinary election where we're talking about tax rates being higher [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=315.12s)]
*  or lower. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  This is about the basic ideals that our country was founded on. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  I think most people understand that, Sean, and we're going to be stronger on the other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  side of it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  All right, Vivek Ramaswamy, maybe we'll see you when we're in South Carolina this week. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for being with us. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=332.76s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuIAA_wrLU&t=333.76s)]
