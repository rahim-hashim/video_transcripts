# Dershowitz & Terrell look back at OJ Simpson trial, critique prosecutors' competencies
**Fox News:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go)
*  Fox News contributor Leo 2.0, Terrell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=0.0s)]
*  He was a friend of O.J. Simpson and his family, along with Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=3.56s)]
*  He served as a legal counsel, as a legal consultant to O.J.'s team during his murder trial. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=7.16s)]
*  All right, Leo, prior to Leo 2.0, that beautiful hat that you have on your head, there was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=12.6s)]
*  a Leo 1.0. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  And there were many occasions that you were on either Hannity and Combs or Hannity, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=21.68s)]
*  I would ask you, how's your buddy O.J.? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=27.84s)]
*  Is he on the golf course looking for the real killers? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=30.44s)]
*  And you'd say, don't go there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=33.72s)]
*  And on a couple of occasions, if my memory serves me right, you would rip off your microphone, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=35.92s)]
*  rip out your earpiece, throw it down, walk off the set, and I'd be showing an empty chair [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=42.36s)]
*  on the air for viewers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=47.96s)]
*  Now, you won't let me show that tape. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=49.92s)]
*  You should, because it's entertaining. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=53.28s)]
*  But you were friends with him, and you never have answered a question that I've tried [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=55.88s)]
*  to ask you for many years. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=59.92s)]
*  This is a serious question. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=61.24s)]
*  And that is, do you think he did this? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=63.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, Sean, you know, my friendship with you and my association with Fox News [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  began with the O.J. Simpson case, and it's been almost 30 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=72.64s)]
*  And I appreciate that and respect that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=77.04s)]
*  We've had discussions about the Simpson case. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=79.04s)]
*  But let me be very clear, and I was friends with the family. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=81.8s)]
*  I knew the majority of the Dream Team. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=84.64s)]
*  I happened to have the privilege to know Mr. Dershowitz as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=87.28s)]
*  As far as the legal system, the legal system worked, because the prosecution failed to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=91.32s)]
*  prove his case. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=97.32s)]
*  And I think the team with Cochran, Dershowitz, Effley, Bailey, Shapiro, they were able to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=98.32s)]
*  prove reasonable doubt. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=103.48s)]
*  Now, the court of public opinion is another story. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=104.92s)]
*  And as far as my personal opinion, it's not relevant. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=107.88s)]
*  But the point is, is that the court of public opinion found Simpson guilty. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=110.64s)]
*  In the rule of law, which we are a nation of law, the jury found no to acquittal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=115.8s)]
*  And I think everyone in this country can agree. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  The prosecution did a horrible job in pursuing their case against O.J. Simpson. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=122.32s)]
*  That isn't really an answer to my question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you think, as a guy that was friends with O.J. and heard all the evidence, do you think [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=133.08s)]
*  your friend did this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=139.84s)]
*  OK, let me simply say, as much as I can in respecting the show and you and my friendship [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=144.08s)]
*  with everyone involved, I believe that my personal opinion as to guilt or innocence [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=149.96s)]
*  is not the issue here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=154.88s)]
*  The issue is whether or not his acquittal was justified. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=155.88s)]
*  And I think you've got Professor Dershowitz who will tell you it's justified. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=160.44s)]
*  And when I was on your show, I argued that point. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=164.72s)]
*  Court of public opinion is another story. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=167.68s)]
*  And you had Stephen A. Smith talk about his opinion as a juror, probably in the court [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=169.76s)]
*  of public opinion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  But the evidence was not proven by the prosecution. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=175.56s)]
*  Blaine, Marcia Clark and Chris Darden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=178.84s)]
*  All right, let me get your take, Professor Dershowitz. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=182.84s)]
*  And for the record, you know this, Professor. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=185.32s)]
*  And I won't ask you, because you were illegally consulting on the case, what you think in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=187.72s)]
*  terms of guilt or innocence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=193.04s)]
*  I don't think that's a fair question, unless you want to answer that or offer that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  However, you had, you know, all of the blood. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=199.76s)]
*  You had the shoes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  You had everything. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=205.16s)]
*  It seemed overwhelming, the evidence. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  It seemed incontrovertible, the evidence. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=210.64s)]
*  Certainly the glove help O.J. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=214.32s)]
*  Most Americans felt he was guilty. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=217.4s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=220.16s)]
*  Look, the evidence was overwhelming. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=221.24s)]
*  There was a mountain of evidence of guilt. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=224.28s)]
*  There was blood evidence. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  There was DNA evidence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=227.28s)]
*  There was only one problem. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  The LAPD framed what they believed was a guilty man by taking one sock, one sock, and pouring [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=230.8s)]
*  the blood of O.J. Simpson and the blood of the victim on the sock. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that the man who did it, Officer Van Hatter, didn't realize that the blood [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=244.92s)]
*  he was pouring on the sock had a chemical in it called EDTA, which is not found in the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  human body but found in test tubes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=255.84s)]
*  So we were able to prove conclusively that one piece of evidence, just the sock, had [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=258.4s)]
*  been tampered with by the government. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  And that created a reasonable doubt. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=265.4s)]
*  And, of course, Stephen A. is absolutely right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=267.6s)]
*  The LAPD was on trial. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=270.44s)]
*  The predominantly black community and the jurors didn't trust the LAPD. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=272.92s)]
*  And that's why it was so dangerous for Van Hatter to try to enhance the evidence by creating [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=278.92s)]
*  that bloody sock, because it played right into the prejudices, perhaps, of the jurors [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=286.44s)]
*  against the LAPD. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=293.8s)]
*  Look, I want to send my sincerest condolences to the Goldman family, the Brown family. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=295.52s)]
*  They've done a phenomenal job in standing up for their relatives. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=302.12s)]
*  And if they had called me first, before the OJ team called me, I probably would have represented [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=306.4s)]
*  the Goldman or the Brown family. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=311.28s)]
*  Lawyers defend people who need a defense. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  And I'm proud of the fact that I helped to expose some corruption among some police officers [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=316.4s)]
*  in the LAPD. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=322.4s)]
*  I'm proud that I helped to disclose some of the divisiveness of the country on racial [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=323.88s)]
*  issues. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=330.56s)]
*  And I also helped to disclose the inadequacy of the prosecution. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=331.68s)]
*  I was sitting right next to OJ when he tried on that glove. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=336.12s)]
*  People don't realize that under the law of California, Darden could have had him put [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  on the glove outside the jury to see whether it fit first before making the fatal mistake. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=344.48s)]
*  And then OJ, right in front of me, walked up to the jury and said, it's too small, it's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=350.8s)]
*  too small. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=355.44s)]
*  At that point, I told him he didn't have to testify, because he had already made his point [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=356.44s)]
*  and he wasn't subject to cross-examination. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=361.64s)]
*  So the bottom line is the jury reached the right verdict. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=364.4s)]
*  That doesn't mean that OJ Simpson didn't do it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  The jury's job is to determine, based on admissible, fair, correct evidence, whether a reasonable [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=370.48s)]
*  doubt existed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=378.2s)]
*  There was a mountain of evidence against him, but there was one little hill on the mountain [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=379.78s)]
*  that was planted by the government, and that little hill on the mountain destroyed the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=384.28s)]
*  government's case. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=389.8s)]
*  So the blame for this doesn't lie in the defense attorneys. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=390.8s)]
*  We did our job. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=393.32s)]
*  It lies with the LAPD, with Darden, and with Clark, and with the entire prosecutorial team. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=394.48s)]
*  They picked Darden and Clark knowing they weren't the most qualified. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=401.8s)]
*  They picked them for racial and gender reasons. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=405.12s)]
*  They would never pick somebody for racial and gender reasons to fly an airplane or to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=407.76s)]
*  be a surgeon, but they did it in this case, and it backfired. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  They could have had much, much better lawyers, but they decided they were going to make a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=416.16s)]
*  racial point or a gender point. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  And in the end, we did our job. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=422.52s)]
*  I'm so sympathetic with the Goldman's and the Brown family. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  I wish I could have been on their side, but I wasn't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  And in the end, I think history will remember OJ Simpson as somebody who possibly did it, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=432.88s)]
*  but who the police tried to frame. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=438.32s)]
*  A guilty person is something that people don't often understand, but that happens. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  All right, Professor, thank you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=446.56s)]
*  I don't think I'll ever get my answer. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm never going to get my answer. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=451.68s)]
*  Leo, maybe I'll need Leo 5.0. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=454.16s)]
*  Maybe then I'll get my answer. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=456.6s)]
*  I'm going to Florida to have dinner with you, and we'll discuss it in private. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IJQuRY5go&t=458.24s)]
