# Jim Jordan: This pardon is ‘suspicious’
**Fox News:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8)
*  Here with reaction, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman James Comer. Is this over, Jim Jordan? Well, we're going to look at David Weiss. Remember, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=4.72s)]
*  Congress has a strong history of looking at special counsels, getting a report from them, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=13.92s)]
*  bringing them in for a hearing or deposition or maybe both. So we're going to look at all that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  But I love what you said in your monologue, Sean. The Biden presidency started with a lie [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=22.48s)]
*  and it ended with a lie. And as you pointed out, there were all kinds of false things in between. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=28.48s)]
*  But remember, October 2020, Joe Biden said in that debate, the Hunter Biden laptop story, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=33.12s)]
*  according to 51 former Intel officials, is a Russian information operation. That was a lie [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=38.72s)]
*  and he knew it at the time. And then of course, yesterday, after saying he wouldn't pardon his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=44.08s)]
*  son, he turns around and does the very thing. Lie at the start, lie at the ending and a terrible [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=48.8s)]
*  four years in between. Thank goodness President Trump is going back to the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=54.24s)]
*  Jim, James Comer, let me ask you, in your mind, is this over? Is this over for Joe Biden? Is it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=60.0s)]
*  over for his brother? Is it over for other family members that were paid monies here? Or does this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=67.84s)]
*  continue? Does Joe Biden need to think about pardoning these family members and maybe himself? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=73.92s)]
*  Well, remember, the House Oversight Committee referred [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=78.56s)]
*  Jim Biden, as well as Hunter Biden, to the Department of Justice for perjury. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=84.08s)]
*  We deposed Hunter Biden and he lied under oath and we brought Jim Biden in for transcribed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=89.12s)]
*  interview and he lied under oath. That's a fact. That's in a report that Jim Jordan and I signed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=94.72s)]
*  and published to the American people. So I would fully expect Joe Biden to pardon Jim Biden. And [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=101.44s)]
*  remember, in our investigation, we found that 10 family members, including Joe Biden, profited from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=108.16s)]
*  the influence peddling schemes where they were shaking down our adversaries around the world for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=114.56s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars. And then they created all these shell companies and laundered the money [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  through the shell companies. And this is according to six banks. Six banks said this in the suspicious [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=125.12s)]
*  activity reports that were filed with Treasury, that they were laundering money and they sent the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=130.72s)]
*  money in incremental payments to 10 different Biden family members. So I think that the new [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=135.36s)]
*  Trump Justice Department is going to have a lot on its platter. I look forward to consulting with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  them to see if we can be of any further assistance. But right now I think the ball will be in Attorney [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=145.44000000000003s)]
*  General Bondi's court. So let me be clear, James Comer, do you believe other Biden family members [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  committed crimes? And do you believe that a new attorney general, if they are upholding the law, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  would be within their jurisdiction to go forward with indictments? And what about Joe Biden himself? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=166.4s)]
*  I believe two other Biden family members definitely and knowingly committed crimes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  In addition to Hunter Biden, you have Jim Biden and Joe Biden. Joe Biden obstructed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=179.12s)]
*  my Chairman Jordan's investigations. He lied multiple times. He lied about his knowledge [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=184.24s)]
*  and involvement. We had sworn testimony from Bob Olensky and Devin Archer that said that Joe Biden [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=191.6s)]
*  knew all along what was going on. He was selling the brand, his brand. He was selling access to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=197.36s)]
*  our enemies around the world. And he lied, just like Jim Jordan said, in the debate about the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=202.0s)]
*  laptop. And he lied when he said he wasn't going to pardon his son. So yes, Joe Biden, in my [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=206.72s)]
*  opinion, has committed crimes. Jim Biden, we saw he took in all these loans. He didn't pay any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=213.28s)]
*  interest, didn't pay any principal, had no loan documentation. At what point do those loans become [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=220.56s)]
*  income? They never paid taxes on it. And by the way, why did he get those loans? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  What was he doing? All the people that wired money to the Bidens were shady characters, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=232.0s)]
*  either adversaries or people that were in trouble needing assistance, needing a prosecutor, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  fired, needing a pardon. They were needing something from Joe Biden, the big guy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=242.8s)]
*  Same question, Jim Jordan. And do you believe that Joe Biden should think about pardoning the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  people that James Comer just mentioned and maybe himself? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, well, Sean, I assume he's already looking to do that for his, particularly for his brother, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=258.48s)]
*  as Jamie pointed out, when we deposed him, he said things that just didn't square with the evidence [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  that we had and the facts that we had gathered. So we'll see. I do think it's interesting. You [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=269.04s)]
*  pointed this out at the time, the broadness, the length of this from December, excuse me, January [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  1st, 2014 to December 1st, 2024, 10 years and 11 months. Remember, three of that 11 year time [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=278.24s)]
*  frame, three of those years was when Joe Biden was vice president. So he's making sure even though [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  the statute of limitations has run for any involvement to Hunter Biden had with Burisma [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  and taxes he owed for that unbelievable amount of income he got from that energy company in Ukraine. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=295.04s)]
*  So I think that is something that I think is just huge. Because remember with Burisma, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  Hunter Biden got put on the board. He wasn't qualified to be on the board. He told us that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=304.24s)]
*  himself in an interview. The heads of Burisma asked him to weigh in with his father to relieve [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  the pressure they are under from the prosecutor in Ukraine. And then fourth, Joe Biden goes and does [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=314.16s)]
*  just that. And he uses our tax money, American tax dollars to say if you want the loan guarantee money, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=319.6s)]
*  stop going after Burisma. My son's on the board and getting paid tons of money. And that happened. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=325.44s)]
*  That's what we were looking at. A Democrat said, oh, there's nothing there, but somehow Joe Biden [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  has to pardon for all that timeframe. I think that's suspicious in and of itself. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. Chairman Jordan and Chairman Comer, thank you. We appreciate it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJyYjhyJKn8&t=340.32000000000005s)]
