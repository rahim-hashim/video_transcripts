# Vivek Ramaswamy: We have a once-in-a-century opportunity
**Fox News:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU)
*  All right, no doubt a leisurely trip to the beaches in Joe Biden's near future. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, here with more former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=5.3s)]
*  Sir, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=9.14s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=10.42s)]
*  Pennsylvania, I have a message to you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=11.9s)]
*  Send me back to Congress. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=14.18s)]
*  We added more to the national debt than any president in his term. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=16.18s)]
*  I'm like, OK, well, he's getting a little closer to the truth. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=19.34s)]
*  July 6th, OK, sure. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  You guys don't report that I'm winning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=27.7s)]
*  I'm like, OK, show me the report where you're winning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=29.5s)]
*  I'm sure there'll be a couple in the media. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=32.42s)]
*  But the American people, I got asked all weekend, did you get asked the same thing all weekend? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=34.78s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=39.36s)]
*  That was the question I got. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  What, what, what did they give this guy before that speech? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  Did you get that question? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=45.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's no good answer to that question, Sean. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  But for all of Joe Biden's frailties, and we're going to see a lot of them between now [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=51.42s)]
*  and the end of the year, the thing that's remarkable about this election, Sean, is that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  we have a unique opportunity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=58.2s)]
*  Voters have a once in a century opportunity this time to actually compare the records [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  of two presidents side by side. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=64.84s)]
*  Four years of Trump, four years of Biden. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=67.26s)]
*  Four years of Trump, you have sealed borders, declining crime, a growing economy, and staying [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=69.78s)]
*  out of foreign conflict. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=74.62s)]
*  Four years of Biden, you have rising crime, rising inflation, an open border, and closer [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  to World War III than we've ever been in my lifetime. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  That's what this election actually comes down to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=83.94s)]
*  And that's a rare opportunity, Sean. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=86.22s)]
*  It's a once in a century opportunity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=87.74s)]
*  Usually you have a president who's stepping up against an incumbent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=89.94s)]
*  They're only able to offer you promises of what they're going to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=92.98s)]
*  The reality is this time it is a rare opportunity in American history where voters get to choose [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=96.5s)]
*  between the records of two presidents, make their choice, and if we present it that way, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=101.06s)]
*  combined with Biden's frailties and gaffes, I think we're going to have hopefully a landslide [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  unifying outcome this November. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=110.66s)]
*  We know what their strategy is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=113.8s)]
*  They're going to say democracy is in peril. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=115.24s)]
*  They'll play up January 6th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=118.04s)]
*  They'll lie in demagogue about abortion and in vitro fertilization. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=119.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is evil. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=126.52s)]
*  And then Joe already, through commercials, they're playing the race card, comparing—by [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=127.92s)]
*  the way, the guy that praised the former Klansman as his mentor and friend and partnered with [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=132.08s)]
*  the former Klansman to stop the integration of schools, because he didn't want those [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=137.52s)]
*  racial jungles, partnered with the Klansman—former Klansman to do that, is now using the Klan [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=143.02s)]
*  in an ad, his supporters. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  Oh, okay, great. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  Will these tactics work? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=153.34s)]
*  Because they're going to have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in these lying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  ads. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=159.58s)]
*  The sad reality is they will work for some, Sean, but I think the American people have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=162.74s)]
*  now been attuned not to swallow what they're force-fed every time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=166.5s)]
*  They tried to do this in the past, even with respect to the issue of immigration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Now look at how that's backfired. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=175.0s)]
*  They said building the wall was somehow racist or xenophobic, that asylum policies that are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=176.72s)]
*  like the ones that you have for Biden are required for compassion, or else you're xenophobic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=181.56s)]
*  I say this as the kid of legal immigrants to this country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=186.08s)]
*  That is not compassion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=189.96s)]
*  That is cruelty to everyone involved. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=190.96s)]
*  And on this campaign, I've been to places like the South Side of Chicago, where you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=193.44s)]
*  have a traditionally Democrat region that's every bit as put off by the actual open border [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=196.84s)]
*  policies we have in this country, then I think we're going to bring many people along with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=201.58s)]
*  us who the Democrats never imagined, and that's how we're going to succeed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=205.5s)]
*  Well, certainly things can't get much worse than what this guy's done to the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=209.54s)]
*  Vivek, great to have you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=214.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmMl0lP9aU&t=215.58s)]
