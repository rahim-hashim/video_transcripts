# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 22, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4)
*  Hi everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, thank you very much for spending time with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=3.2s)]
*  All right, new science tonight that the Harris campaign is gasping for air. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  So Kamala took the day off from the campaign trail for airtime on NBC. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=11.0s)]
*  And as she continues to pillory Trump's character and his credibility, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=16.16s)]
*  how did she do in defending her own? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=20.2s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=23.28s)]
*  And you never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=38.68s)]
*  It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=42.84s)]
*  Should he? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  He is absolutely... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=48.16s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=52.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. Joe Biden is not. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=58.64s)]
*  It's a judgment question. That's why I ask. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=61.88s)]
*  Can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have to level with Americans in that way? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=63.84s)]
*  I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=70.84s)]
*  I have no reluctance in saying that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  No, of course I don't. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=83.4s)]
*  She's so indignant every time she's asked a logical question. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  You're questioning Donald Trump's credibility. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=90.2s)]
*  You're claiming he's exhausted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=93.12s)]
*  And then you're making that ridiculous point about Joe Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  None of it adds up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=99.36s)]
*  And that took her all day to prepare for. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  No wonder she's losing support, even among traditionally Democrat voters, I may add. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=103.76s)]
*  Which brings us to he say, well, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=109.32s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like yesterday, Chicago, the DNC, all that joy, all that excitement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=117.16s)]
*  In our community, we have a saying, see, said, well, which means, yes, it means, yes, we can. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=125.44s)]
*  But tonight, I'm here to tell you, yes, she can. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=133.88s)]
*  So we're going to say she said, well, when somebody says, is she qualified for the job? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=137.72s)]
*  We're going to say she said, well, when somebody asks, is she going to be the first female [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=143.2s)]
*  president of the United States? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=149.6s)]
*  We're going to say she said, well, she said, well, she said, well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=151.96s)]
*  But there is growing evidence tonight that for Kamala and the Hispanic vote, it's no se puede. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=160.48s)]
*  A new USA Today, Suffolk poll shows that Latino voters now prefer Trump over Harris by 11 points. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  But how can this be? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  Because the DC establishment for years had warned conservatives that their tough stance [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  on border enforcement, ending birthright citizenship, that that would destroy its chances [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=185.48s)]
*  with America's fastest growing demographic group, Hispanics. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  No one has come up with a math mathematical route to the presidency that allows you to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  have that kind of negative number with Latino voters. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=202.64s)]
*  And so what he's doing is actively repelling those people, actively making those people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=205.92s)]
*  not want to vote for him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=211.28s)]
*  I've been talking to communities across the country for the campaign, especially Latino [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=213.08s)]
*  communities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=219.52s)]
*  I have reminded them about what we experienced for four years under Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=220.52s)]
*  We know that that Trump and the GOP has abandoned Latino voters. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  That could be my favorite montage of the week. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=233.0s)]
*  And we've had a lot of good montages. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=235.12s)]
*  All right, but it turns out all those years ago, Trump and a few of us were 100 percent [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  correct and the DC swamp, the Chamber of Commerce crowd, all the media types, they were wrong. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=243.0s)]
*  Hispanic voters, we insisted, wanted a strong economy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=249.64s)]
*  Hispanic voters wanted good schools. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  They wanted safe neighborhoods. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  They believed in family values. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=255.32s)]
*  And we said that that mass amnesty argument and open borders would hurt legal immigrants [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=257.44s)]
*  and poor people the most. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=262.84s)]
*  Well, fast forward nine years to today's Trump's roundtable in Miami. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=265.24s)]
*  Now, once again, we see that he was right and all of his critics were wrong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=269.12s)]
*  More Hispanic Americans than ever are going full mega. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  They respect him because he respects them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, it's amazing what you've done for the Hispanic community, and you are going [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=282.8s)]
*  to be rewarded handsomely for that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=289.4s)]
*  They've rewarded me already. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  They produce for the country because the level of genius, entrepreneurship, energy that they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=293.48s)]
*  have, it's an incredible community. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=300.68s)]
*  And I liked them and they liked me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  And now they're seeing numbers that are shocking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  What else is shocking? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  How hard inflation makes it for businesses, including Hispanic-owned businesses, for them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=309.24s)]
*  to be able to stay afloat and, of course, to grow. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=315.24s)]
*  In the last three and a half years, the worst years for businesses, inflation, interest [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=319.4s)]
*  rates with banks, prices, everything, everything, you know, is nothing compared to 2017 to 20. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=325.08s)]
*  We need your help as soon as possible. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=334.28s)]
*  We need you help us with banks to stop regulations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=337.64s)]
*  It is so difficult right now to create more jobs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  Ayúdanos, por favor. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=346.44s)]
*  Help us, please. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=348.2s)]
*  And rather than try to downplay the border issue at this event, Trump made it a focus. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=349.56s)]
*  I really think that the biggest problem this country has is what they've allowed to happen [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=355.32s)]
*  to us on the border. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=359.32s)]
*  They've allowed our country to be destroyed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=360.76s)]
*  What's happening to our country is so crazy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=363.72s)]
*  You get angrier and angrier because it's so simple and it's so obvious. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  And everyone knows it's true and nobody does anything about it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=370.36s)]
*  OK, wait, wait, wait, wait a second. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=373.64s)]
*  What about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris assuring us, Mr. President, that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=375.88s)]
*  they've tightened up the border in recent months? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=380.52s)]
*  They're going to have open borders, 100 percent, just like they tried to trick everybody. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=383.32s)]
*  They said they tried to tighten it up a little bit just to make it because they have an election [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=387.96s)]
*  coming up. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=392.84s)]
*  And of course, from watching the angle and the reporting of our own Bill Mollusian, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=394.68s)]
*  voters are learning the truth, aren't they? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=399.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of migrants are right now being fast-tracked into the country by other means [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=402.04s)]
*  through humanitarian parole, through special immigrant visas and via the CBP app. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=408.28s)]
*  And all communities are being swamped by this influx. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  Local budgets, they're under strain by migrants who need schooling, they need housing, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=419.96s)]
*  they need health care. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=424.44s)]
*  And for all the women out there who are all in for Kamala, perhaps just for a moment. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  Consider what her border policies are doing to young women and girls. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=431.8s)]
*  Fox confirming that the suspects arrested in Florida in connection with the sex trafficking [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=437.56s)]
*  of a 15-year-old girl were in the United States illegally. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=443.24s)]
*  These people should have never been in this country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=448.68s)]
*  This should have never happened. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=450.36s)]
*  And we see this all the time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=451.88s)]
*  We've had four incidences in Palm Beach County involving illegals that came across the border, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=453.24s)]
*  should have never been in this country and committed crimes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=458.44s)]
*  The great interview by Martha McCallum and Harris's Let Them In and Hope for the Best approach to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=461.48s)]
*  border. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  That has facilitated the largest child sex trafficking operation the world has ever seen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=468.12s)]
*  How's that for girl power? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=475.32s)]
*  And of course, Hispanic girls are often the victims here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  And Hispanic voters know this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=480.44s)]
*  But rather than focus on ending this madness, protecting our own people and protecting the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=483.0s)]
*  migrants, Democrats try to make Trump out to be the villain here. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=487.72s)]
*  It's his same old con. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  It's his same old con. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=497.0s)]
*  Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=501.0s)]
*  Welcome to Donald Trump and Stephen Miller's America, where the federal government tries [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  to coerce state and local governments to adopt the most anti-immigrant policies. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=513.72s)]
*  We rejected xenophobia of my predecessor and leaders like him around the world. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=519.96s)]
*  All right, Gramps. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=526.28s)]
*  But despite the blowback from the blowhards, Trump kept going. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=527.24s)]
*  Because we all know this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=532.28s)]
*  A country without a border at some point is not a country at all. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=533.88s)]
*  How millions of people are arriving so quickly, so efficiently. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  So this is the first group that's going to go to the border, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=544.44s)]
*  and then you're going to come back and pick up more people? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=547.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=549.24s)]
*  This SUV pulls up, and the migrants are loaded in one by one, every inch of space taken. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  Every week, we get like more than 200, 300. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=557.24s)]
*  Of course, the Democrats knew that an open border would end up with situations like that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=564.12s)]
*  The cartels cashing in and Americans and migrants alike would be brutalized as a result. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=570.6s)]
*  But the thing that really gets me, and a lot of this really gets to me, as you know, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=578.04s)]
*  for 20 years I've been covering this issue, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=582.52s)]
*  our border's arena and Alejandro Mayorca's, they didn't give a rip. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  Remember, they're all about compassion. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=592.6s)]
*  They don't care because they're fanatics. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=594.36s)]
*  But Hispanics are not. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=597.4s)]
*  They're pragmatic and they're patriotic. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=599.8s)]
*  You're a builder. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=603.4s)]
*  You're a uniter. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=605.24s)]
*  You're courageous. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=606.92s)]
*  You love and you create. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=608.28s)]
*  The other side of loving and building and creating is hating and destroying and dividing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=610.84s)]
*  We have become, from the land of opportunity, the land of exploitation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=617.72s)]
*  And the exploiter in chief is Kamala Harris and this administration. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=622.84s)]
*  Well, the Democrats answered all this is just more of the same, smears and fears. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=631.08s)]
*  So no matter what happens two weeks ago, two weeks from today, Donald Trump, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=637.32s)]
*  the man the DC establishment excoriated for being anti-Latino and anti-immigrant, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=642.12s)]
*  will likely win the largest share of the Latino vote of any Republican in American history. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=647.72s)]
*  And if he wins the presidency, the GOP going forward will have a fighting chance [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=654.76s)]
*  in states like California and Colorado because success breeds more success. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=659.72s)]
*  Si se puede. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=667.08s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=668.28s)]
*  Two weeks to go until election day and Democrats just yanked Kamala Harris off the campaign trail. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=669.24s)]
*  She took the day off. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  Zero campaign events today. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=676.2s)]
*  And the only thing on her schedule, two interviews. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=678.36s)]
*  Not even live. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=681.64s)]
*  She spent all day preparing because that last interview with Brett, not that great. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=683.08s)]
*  Or maybe she wasn't preparing at all. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=688.12s)]
*  We'll show you the interviews later and you can decide for yourself. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=690.44s)]
*  Trump says maybe she was getting her beauty rest. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=694.1999999999999s)]
*  She's sleeping right now. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=697.56s)]
*  She couldn't go on the trail. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=698.76s)]
*  You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=700.68s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=703.8s)]
*  I said, where is she campaigning today, sir? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=704.68s)]
*  She's got a day off. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=706.84s)]
*  You have 14 days left for the presidency. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=707.64s)]
*  She's taking a day off. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=709.64s)]
*  This is not what you want. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  This is not what you want. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=712.76s)]
*  You can't get home for it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=714.12s)]
*  Who the hell takes off? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=715.56s)]
*  You have 14 days left and she'll take a couple of more days off too. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=716.92s)]
*  You know why? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=720.76s)]
*  She's lazy as hell and she's got that reputation. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=721.16s)]
*  Let me see if we have this right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=724.28s)]
*  Kamala calls Trump exhausted and then takes the day off. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=725.56s)]
*  McDonald's, football games, barbershops, town halls, round tables, rallies. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=729.0799999999999s)]
*  You've seen them. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=733.4799999999999s)]
*  Kamala today didn't talk to a single voter. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=734.76s)]
*  She stayed home in D.C. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  And the media is getting nervous. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=740.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, everybody I talk to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=742.68s)]
*  I can't read anything. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=745.64s)]
*  I'm meditating. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=746.68s)]
*  I'm doing yoga. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=747.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm doing... [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=748.28s)]
*  I'm so anxious. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=748.76s)]
*  I just don't even know. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=749.96s)]
*  I'm eating gummies. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=750.84s)]
*  All kinds of things, you know. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=754.36s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  Not eating gummies. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=756.76s)]
*  Okay, we got that clear. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=765.08s)]
*  All right, no gummies. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=767.08s)]
*  Maybe she spent the day doing yoga. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=768.2800000000001s)]
*  Because if she was preparing for the NBC interview, it didn't look like it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=770.52s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=776.12s)]
*  It was a bad debate. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=780.2800000000001s)]
*  People have bad debates. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=781.48s)]
*  He is absolutely... [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=784.0400000000001s)]
*  But that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=790.2800000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden is not. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=798.0400000000001s)]
*  And my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=799.88s)]
*  that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the ambitions and aspirations [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=807.32s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=812.36s)]
*  It's a judgment question. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=814.44s)]
*  That's why I ask. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=815.4000000000001s)]
*  Can the American people trust you in these moments, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=816.36s)]
*  even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=818.36s)]
*  To level with Americans in that way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=821.8000000000001s)]
*  So that's why I ask. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  And it sounds like what you're saying is you feel like you never saw anything like that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=824.44s)]
*  from President Biden. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=827.24s)]
*  I have worked with Joe Biden whether... [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=827.96s)]
*  Hours and hours and hours over these four years, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=830.7600000000001s)]
*  whether it be in the Situation Room or the Oval Office. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=833.96s)]
*  I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=837.72s)]
*  I have no reluctance in saying that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=848.44s)]
*  No, of course I don't. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=850.2800000000001s)]
*  Kamala is trapped because if she says she noticed Biden's decline, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=851.24s)]
*  she's guilty of a cover-up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=855.4000000000001s)]
*  But if she says she didn't notice, everyone knows she's just a liar. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=857.08s)]
*  So she's a liar either way. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  And then she said the American dream was dead. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=863.5600000000001s)]
*  Are the last four years an obstacle to you in this race? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=866.52s)]
*  Here's how I look at it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=870.3599999999999s)]
*  First of all, let me be very clear. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=871.56s)]
*  Mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=874.28s)]
*  I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  And it has informed a number of my areas of focus, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=879.7199999999999s)]
*  most of which are, onto your point, lowering costs. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=882.76s)]
*  I haven't traveled in the country. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=885.9599999999999s)]
*  I am very clear. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=887.64s)]
*  Cost of grocery is still too high. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=888.92s)]
*  The voters know it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=890.92s)]
*  I know it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=891.64s)]
*  So part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=892.92s)]
*  including the work I will do dealing with price gouging, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=897.08s)]
*  something I dealt with when I was attorney general, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=899.96s)]
*  something I will deal with going forward. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=901.96s)]
*  Cost of housing. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=903.96s)]
*  You know, I'm speaking with people of every background [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=905.08s)]
*  in every area of the country of every age. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=908.04s)]
*  And you know, the idea of the American dream was something [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=911.24s)]
*  that previous generations could count on, not as much anymore. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=913.96s)]
*  So the other week, she said she couldn't think of anything [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=917.24s)]
*  she'd do differently than Biden. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=919.64s)]
*  And now she says her administration wouldn't be a continuation. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=921.48s)]
*  Okay, if Kamala had ideas about bringing prices down, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=926.36s)]
*  why didn't she share them with Biden? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  Why'd she tell us Bidenomics was working? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=931.88s)]
*  None of this makes any sense. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=935.08s)]
*  Where'd happy Kamala go? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=937.48s)]
*  She doesn't look like she's enjoying running for president. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=940.04s)]
*  She definitely wasn't ready to run for president. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=943.4s)]
*  Yesterday, she said, guys, you're scared. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=946.6800000000001s)]
*  And so am I. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=949.0s)]
*  If I can just speak to the what people are feeling, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=949.72s)]
*  we cannot despair. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=956.6s)]
*  We cannot despair. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=959.4s)]
*  And I say do not despair because in a democracy, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=961.08s)]
*  as long as we can keep it in our democracy, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=964.36s)]
*  the people, every individual has the power [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=967.88s)]
*  to make a decision about what this will be. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=973.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=975.4s)]
*  So let's not feel powerless. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=976.2s)]
*  Let's not let the some, and I get it, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=979.16s)]
*  overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=982.6s)]
*  because then we have been defeated. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=987.0s)]
*  Is that the saddest looking town hall you've ever seen? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=989.64s)]
*  Democrats are starting to ask, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=993.16s)]
*  what if Joe Biden was the better candidate all along? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  They want a coup do over. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=998.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not a godsend, all right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1001.72s)]
*  You people didn't even like her six months ago. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1004.76s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, she's black female Jesus, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1008.28s)]
*  the way Obama was black Jesus. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1012.1999999999999s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1014.28s)]
*  He had a lot more going for him than Kamala Harris does. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1015.48s)]
*  And not just as firsts go, but his type of campaigning, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1018.28s)]
*  his type of persuasion, his charisma. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1023.16s)]
*  So while Harris takes the day off from campaigning, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1026.04s)]
*  the real Messiah is filling her shoes or heels. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1029.16s)]
*  Barry went to Wisconsin and Michigan today, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1033.0s)]
*  but he sounded bitter. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1035.48s)]
*  Real strength about working hard, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1036.52s)]
*  real strength about taking responsibility for your actions, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1040.44s)]
*  real strength about telling the truth even when it's inconvenient. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1044.36s)]
*  Real strength is about helping people who need it [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1049.08s)]
*  and standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1053.0s)]
*  That's what we should want for our daughters and our sons. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1057.4s)]
*  That's what I want in the president of the United States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1062.04s)]
*  Yeah, he has a guilty conscience after shivving Scranton Joe [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1066.36s)]
*  for a woman who can't even tell you what a woman is. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1070.2s)]
*  They're even dragging Michelle kicking and screaming [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1072.9199999999998s)]
*  out of her Hawaiian mansion to say, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1075.32s)]
*  this is the second time she's proud of the country. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1077.32s)]
*  Where's Michelle been since the convention? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1080.2s)]
*  If democracy was really on the line, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1082.9199999999998s)]
*  shouldn't Michelle be living in the battlegrounds instead of Honolulu? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1084.68s)]
*  Every musician is now being ordered to campaign for Kamala. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1089.0s)]
*  After Usher, Lizzo, Stevie Wonder, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  the Harris campaign's bringing out Bruce Springsteen for a concert series. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  Oh, and Barack's bringing out Eminem in Detroit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1100.36s)]
*  Eminem endorsing Kamala. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1104.52s)]
*  Does somebody have something on him? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  Earlier in the day, actor Bradley Whitford from the West Wing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1110.52s)]
*  put on quite the performance. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1114.04s)]
*  He was laughing. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1122.6s)]
*  He was laughing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1128.36s)]
*  Misogyny is at the reptilian brain stem of white Christian nationalism. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1129.56s)]
*  And that is what we are up against. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1145.08s)]
*  What's next? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1149.0s)]
*  Is he going to yank his pinky off and light it like a cigarette? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1149.72s)]
*  And how lucky are we? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1153.48s)]
*  How lucky are we to have Kamala Harris and Tim Ross? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1156.2s)]
*  If things are so great under the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1161.96s)]
*  so great that it should continue, why is everybody so angry? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1164.92s)]
*  Why isn't it morning in America again? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1169.16s)]
*  The Harris campaign's running out of ideas and time. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1172.1200000000001s)]
*  According to CNN, their closing strategy is to count on Trump [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1175.48s)]
*  making outlandish claims. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1179.24s)]
*  Yeah, you can count on that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1182.1200000000001s)]
*  But that's a strategy that has nothing to do with Kamala Harris [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1184.52s)]
*  or the American people for that matter. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1188.68s)]
*  That's like asking Danica Patrick, how are you going to win the Daytona 500? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1191.16s)]
*  And she says, I'm hoping the guy in the lead crashes. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1195.32s)]
*  Oh, if that doesn't work, Biden has a better idea. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1199.88s)]
*  I think she has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1202.92s)]
*  to be able to, if need be, if it was the case, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1207.64s)]
*  to actually eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot, kill [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1211.0800000000002s)]
*  someone who he believes would be the threat to. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, so I know this sounds bizarre. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1220.04s)]
*  It sounds like if I said this five years ago, you'd lock me up. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1223.16s)]
*  We got to lock him up. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1227.72s)]
*  Now we know he's definitely sabotaging her. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1233.24s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1237.4s)]
*  And tonight we are going to stop our election countdown [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1238.2s)]
*  because really every day is Election Day. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1241.88s)]
*  Right now is Election Day in most states, commonwealths in our country. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1244.28s)]
*  And it's all across the country, meaning you can vote today, tomorrow, the next day. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1249.24s)]
*  And you don't need to wait 14 days until officially Election Day, November the 5th. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1255.0s)]
*  Now, in fact, it is a good idea, my view, to bank your vote. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  What if there's bad weather? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1265.0s)]
*  What if there's another, God forbid, hurricane or some other emergency on Election Day? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1266.52s)]
*  My recommendation, vote early. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1271.16s)]
*  Now, it's not the system I want. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1273.72s)]
*  We've talked about that a lot. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1275.4s)]
*  But you can't change the system unless you win elections. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1276.76s)]
*  I also highly recommend that you assume, especially if you're in, well, Georgia, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1280.6000000000001s)]
*  North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, that your vote [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1286.52s)]
*  will decide this election because in a handful of swing states, the margin, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1293.96s)]
*  the margin of error is very, very thin. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1298.92s)]
*  And especially if you live in those seven swing states that I just mentioned, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1301.24s)]
*  it just is what it is. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1305.0s)]
*  And this race is too important to leave anything to chance. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  Polls are interesting, however, but there's only one poll that matters. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1311.08s)]
*  That is what happens when we count the votes for the election. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1316.3600000000001s)]
*  Don't let any poll, good or bad, impact your thinking, your motions on this election. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1321.0s)]
*  Let us be very clear. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1327.7199999999998s)]
*  The American dream, in my view, is very much at stake. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  If Kamala Harris's stated policies, her radicalism, extremism, is ever adopted in this country, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1333.32s)]
*  I would argue that America that we know today will be unrecognizable in four years. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1341.24s)]
*  Democrats, the state-run media mob, they already are telling voters [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1345.8s)]
*  to scale back your ambitions about what you think the American dream is. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1350.04s)]
*  Or as even the Washington Post put it, quote, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1354.68s)]
*  the new American dream comes with a smaller yard. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1357.96s)]
*  Why should we settle for less? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1363.24s)]
*  Why should you settle for less? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1364.76s)]
*  Why should your children and grandchildren settle for less? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1366.2s)]
*  Don't we have an obligation to leave this country in better shape than we found it, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1369.16s)]
*  like our parents did for us, our grandparents did for all of us? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1373.08s)]
*  This kind of negative thinking has been around since Jimmy Carter [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1377.0s)]
*  was encouraging Americans to turn down their heat in the winter, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1380.76s)]
*  but on a sweater, suffer in silence. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1384.2s)]
*  Now coming up, we're going to show you how the Harris campaign [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1387.0s)]
*  is now trying to normalize sky-high inflation, higher taxes, rising crime, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1389.8s)]
*  mass illegal immigration with free sex change operations. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1396.28s)]
*  But we begin with some good news. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1399.96s)]
*  We do look at some polls, but again, don't let it impact you. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1401.32s)]
*  The new USA Today-Suffolk University poll has Donald Trump [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1404.84s)]
*  up by 11 points with Hispanic Americans. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1410.28s)]
*  Now Trump lost this growing demographic by 11 points in 2020. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1413.1599999999999s)]
*  That's a 22-point swing, but as always, caution. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1418.12s)]
*  Remember that red wave in 2022, the one we thought was coming, never materialized. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1422.36s)]
*  And according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1427.48s)]
*  fewer than three in 10 men in Georgia are supporting Harris. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1430.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is up by four, according to the AJC. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1434.76s)]
*  And meanwhile, early voting has been better than expected for the GOP. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1438.2s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1442.28s)]
*  Here's left-leading journalist Mark Halpern. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1443.8s)]
*  Listen closely. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1445.8s)]
*  If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that's a big if, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1447.0800000000002s)]
*  we'll almost certainly know before election day who's going to win the election. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1451.96s)]
*  We're going to talk a lot about that. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1455.8s)]
*  The reasons why Democrats might be underperforming, the prospect that they'll recover. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1457.96s)]
*  But again, make no mistake, if these numbers hold up, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1463.0s)]
*  in the states where we can understand even partially what the data's like, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1466.2s)]
*  we'll know that Donald Trump's going to be president on election day. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1470.2s)]
*  Mark Halpern's a pretty smart guy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1473.72s)]
*  According to Fake News CNN, the Harris campaign is now, quote, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1476.28s)]
*  jittery. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1479.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, NBC News reporting that campaign officials, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1480.6s)]
*  they are worried that Michigan and or Wisconsin will fall and that North Carolina is now slipping [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1483.48s)]
*  away for the Democrats. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1488.92s)]
*  But today, shockingly, Kamala Harris, he took the day off. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  She kind of took it easy. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1493.8s)]
*  With just, you know, 14 days until the official election day, although every day is election day, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1495.08s)]
*  she didn't have a single rally. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1500.76s)]
*  And now Donald Trump, rightly accusing his opponent of being, well, lazy as hell. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1502.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1507.88s)]
*  We're in a race with some very sick people. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1509.4s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1511.72s)]
*  They just lie. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1512.52s)]
*  They lie about everything. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1513.48s)]
*  And I was going to hit her really hard on the trail today, but now I don't have to because [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1514.68s)]
*  she's off. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1520.6000000000001s)]
*  She's off. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1521.72s)]
*  No, I can't get over it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1523.24s)]
*  Who the hell takes off? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1524.92s)]
*  You have 14 days left and she'll take a couple of more days off too. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1526.28s)]
*  You know why? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1530.04s)]
*  She's lazy as hell and she's got that reputation. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1530.52s)]
*  She's a radical left lunatic. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1533.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, he was in Florida today meeting with Hispanic business leaders. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1536.3600000000001s)]
*  On Friday, he will sit down for one of the most popular podcasts in the country, the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1540.52s)]
*  Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1545.4s)]
*  You don't want to miss that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1546.76s)]
*  We'll have highlights on Friday night. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1547.96s)]
*  And tonight, Democrats, they're just in a state of utter panic. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1549.8s)]
*  The only other way to describe it, they can't run on Kamala's terrible record or extreme [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1553.96s)]
*  beliefs, so they're going, well, repulsively negative. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1558.6000000000001s)]
*  And now the smears, the slander, the besmirchment, the outright fear mongering. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1564.2s)]
*  It's never been worse. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1569.3200000000002s)]
*  And I've been doing this a long time. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1570.6000000000001s)]
*  Earlier tonight, President Biden accused Trump of wanting to shoot and to kill his political [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1572.0400000000002s)]
*  opponents and seemingly vowed to lock him up. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1577.3200000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1581.72s)]
*  This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant, every single one. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1583.16s)]
*  Thinks he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able to, if need [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1589.08s)]
*  be, if he it was the case, to actually eliminate physically, eliminate, shoot, kill someone [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1593.9599999999998s)]
*  who is he believes would be the threat to. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1601.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, so I know this sounds bizarre. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1605.32s)]
*  It sounds like I said this five years ago. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1608.4399999999998s)]
*  You'd lock me up. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1610.9199999999998s)]
*  We got to lock him up. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1612.9199999999998s)]
*  Politically, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1613.96s)]
*  walking out. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1620.92s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1621.64s)]
*  Just for the record, the only candidate that has been shot at in this election is Donald [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1624.04s)]
*  Trump. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1629.48s)]
*  He's also the only candidate facing prison time because of multiple bogus, politically [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1630.04s)]
*  charged investigation from Harris and Biden's weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1635.24s)]
*  But Democrats want you to believe that Trump is the threat to democracy? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1640.36s)]
*  Well, on this very question, even the Washington Post poll shows Americans believe Kamala Harris [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1644.68s)]
*  is the bigger threat, not Donald Trump. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1650.12s)]
*  Democrats are trying to gaslight the American people. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1652.68s)]
*  That's all they've got. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1655.32s)]
*  And now our old friend, famed Democratic strategist James Carville, clearly I've [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1656.52s)]
*  known James well. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1662.2s)]
*  I've debated him many times, clearly in a state of utter panic and becoming a little [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1663.0s)]
*  unglued. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1669.24s)]
*  James, you might want one of those gummies. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1670.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1671.88s)]
*  This is not an exaggeration. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1673.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1676.52s)]
*  This is not to say, well, he's really not. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1677.0s)]
*  It didn't mean he's going to really get rid of Social Security, James. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1681.88s)]
*  No, he is telling you right to your stupid face that he is going to use the military [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1685.8s)]
*  to arrest and suppress his political opponents. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1695.08s)]
*  But I'm sure that I and everybody else that does this for a living is going to get asked, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1699.4s)]
*  well, what about the swing voters in such and such a state? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1707.32s)]
*  You know where they're going to all swing from? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1711.88s)]
*  The end of a rope. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1714.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1717.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1718.04s)]
*  James, you said in an interview you like gummies and you took one the night that Joe [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1718.6s)]
*  Biden was debating Donald Trump. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1723.4s)]
*  Maybe it's time. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1725.0s)]
*  You got to chill a little bit. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1725.8s)]
*  James, if anyone could try to silence you, Rachel Maddow afraid her show is going to [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1727.8000000000002s)]
*  be canceled and everything. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1733.0800000000002s)]
*  I will personally stand up for all of you and I will fight for your right to be wrong [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1734.68s)]
*  on the airwaves. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1740.68s)]
*  I will fight for your freedom of speech. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1741.8000000000002s)]
*  It is not true what is being said. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1745.0s)]
*  It is fear mongering at the worst level. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1747.64s)]
*  The only Democrat that actually got it right was Bill Maher. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1749.8000000000002s)]
*  He was asked, well, if Donald Trump wins, what are you going to do? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1753.24s)]
*  He goes, uh, I'm going to stay. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1755.64s)]
*  I'm going to do my show and make jokes about Donald Trump. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1757.64s)]
*  Nobody's getting arrested. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1761.88s)]
*  No political opponents are going to be rounded up. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1763.24s)]
*  Does anyone in the Democratic Party, by the way, have any self-awareness at all? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1765.72s)]
*  Apparently not because after lecturing the American, you know, men last week like he [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1770.76s)]
*  did and accusing them of outright sexism, quote the brothers, quote Barack Obama, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1776.1200000000001s)]
*  he's just perplexed. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1781.4s)]
*  He just doesn't understand how America got so divided. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1783.0s)]
*  What about all the people who had their homes raided, pre-dawn raids, fake news, CNN cameras, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1787.16s)]
*  all the people associated with Donald Trump, you know, arrested and fingerprinted, mug [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1793.32s)]
*  shot it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1798.28s)]
*  I guess what they're saying is they don't want what they did to Republicans done to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1799.08s)]
*  them. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1804.68s)]
*  And by the way, it shouldn't be done to them. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1805.16s)]
*  It shouldn't have been done this time. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1807.4s)]
*  But take a look. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1809.0s)]
*  You know, this election is going to be tight. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1810.76s)]
*  It's going to be tight here in Wisconsin. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1815.6399999999999s)]
*  It's going to be tight all across the country. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1817.08s)]
*  And it's going to be tight because a lot of Americans are still struggling. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1820.44s)]
*  And people started feeling like no matter how hard they worked, they were just treading [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1826.84s)]
*  water. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1830.6s)]
*  So I understand why folks are looking to shake things up. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1832.9199999999998s)]
*  And I know it can be frustrating. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1837.48s)]
*  Look, I do not watch cable news. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1839.24s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1841.8s)]
*  There are times where I just I don't understand how we got so toxic and just so divided and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1845.72s)]
*  so bitter. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1854.36s)]
*  Notice he said treading water. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1856.36s)]
*  He's acknowledging that for the last four years that Harris and Biden have failed. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1858.36s)]
*  They now the Washington Post is talking about lowering your expectations. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1865.08s)]
*  Maybe you'll have to buy a townhouse instead of a home with a backyard. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1869.16s)]
*  But really, Barack, what I what I really want to know, you know, I guess I'm one of those [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1873.08s)]

*  Right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1887.4s)]
*  And if we believe Jesus is Lord, by the way, and you say it at a Kamala rally, guess what? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1888.04s)]

*  Anyway, Biden Democrats that keep saying that Trump Republicans are a threat to democracy. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1896.76s)]
*  Well, why don't they run on the great economic success? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1901.72s)]
*  Ask yourself this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1904.76s)]
*  Their closing argument is fear, calling Trump racist and a threat to democracy. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1905.96s)]
*  And of course, Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1912.2800000000002s)]

*  Oh, that's right. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1919.48s)]
*  Barack said we're treading water or that the border is safe and secure, which they told [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1920.04s)]
*  us for three years. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1925.08s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1926.2s)]
*  And how American towns and cities are more safe and more secure. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1927.96s)]
*  No defund dismantled, no bail laws kind of stop that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1932.44s)]
*  And that you're paying a lot less at the pump than for enter. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1936.36s)]
*  No, we're paying about a buck, buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1940.2s)]
*  And what a great economy we have and what low inflation we have. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1943.8799999999999s)]

*  That's right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1953.16s)]
*  Nothing has gotten better under Harris and Biden and their failed policies. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1954.36s)]
*  They failed. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1959.0s)]
*  Americans are suffering. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1960.04s)]
*  It's an obvious time for change. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1961.56s)]

*  assassination from the left. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1969.08s)]

*  Mussolini and on. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1983.48s)]
*  And don't even get me started on the Russia hoax and the left's love of censorship [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1985.0800000000002s)]
*  in this country. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1989.56s)]
*  Many on the left are even hyper partisan when it comes to trivial matters. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1990.68s)]
*  Now, this week, the New York Times bashed Trump for not properly preparing French fries [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  during his stop at McDonald's. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2000.28s)]
*  And on TV, the hysteria was worse. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2003.24s)]
*  Whoopi's upset that he didn't wear a hair net. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2006.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2009.08s)]
*  Forever, he was saying she never worked at McDonald's. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2010.52s)]
*  So now he took himself to McDonald's. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2014.36s)]
*  That was clothes. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2016.76s)]
*  McDonald's, that was clothes and he wasn't wearing a hair net, which really bothered me. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2017.48s)]
*  No net? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2022.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2023.08s)]
*  I don't want your French fries. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2024.44s)]
*  She actually worked in a McDonald's. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2026.92s)]
*  She didn't go and pander and disrespect McDonald's. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2028.68s)]
*  Workers, by standing there in your red tie and take a picture. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2032.28s)]
*  He worked briefly as a fry cooker without a hair net, I might add. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2034.6s)]
*  Oh, like he carried weapons in a war zone that he never went to and that he was a head [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2040.76s)]
*  coach, but he wasn't and that he said he had one rank in the military that he never achieved. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2047.24s)]
*  We still don't have an answer to a pretty important question. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2053.96s)]
*  Why is Kamala Harris even the nominee and not the guy that actually won the Democratic [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2057.48s)]
*  primary by millions of votes? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2061.88s)]
*  Is that a threat to democracy? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2063.56s)]
*  Tonight, during an interview, Kamala still could not answer that question. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2065.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2069.32s)]
*  Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2070.68s)]
*  moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again, repeatedly in that time? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2073.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2079.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2080.12s)]
*  if they're president. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2094.68s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2095.56s)]
*  It was a bad debate. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2099.72s)]
*  People have bad debates. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2100.92s)]
*  He is absolutely... [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2103.48s)]
*  But that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2105.0s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2109.6400000000003s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2113.1600000000003s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2115.4s)]
*  Joe Biden is not. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2117.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2129.4s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2130.92s)]
*  You can come over later. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2132.1200000000003s)]

*  So it appears that Donald Trump will reportedly make his debut on Joe Rogan this week. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  In response, Kamala will appeal to her base by appearing on Love After Lockup. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2144.6s)]
*  First lady, Joe Biden said that Joe dropping out of the race was the right call. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2152.52s)]
*  Also the right call, the one she made to 1-800-chairlift. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2157.16s)]
*  The McDonald's Corporation says it doesn't have any evidence of Kamala ever working there. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2160.68s)]
*  Though there are rumors of her sleeping with Mayor McChese. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2166.3599999999997s)]

*  The only stipulation is that Walz not be allowed within 500 feet of the play place. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2178.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2183.32s)]

*  Kamala Harris is facing another plagiarism accusation. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2225.32s)]
*  Apparently she was the one who was accused of plagiarism. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2229.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2231.32s)]
*  Oh, stop it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2233.32s)]
*  Was it worth it? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2235.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2237.32s)]
*  So last night Kamala helped out a young woman who was a little bit of a [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2239.32s)]
*  So last night Kamala held a town hall and it had all the spontaneity of synchronized swimming. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2258.14s)]
*  I wonder would the audience be able to ask questions? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2266.14s)]
*  Are we going to be able to answer questions? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2268.14s)]
*  You're not, unfortunately. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2270.14s)]
*  We have some pre-determined questions and I hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2272.14s)]

*  Hell, Kamala can't even answer scripted questions. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2292.14s)]
*  We give her a week in advance. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2294.14s)]
*  So right off the bat we got the lay of the land. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2296.14s)]
*  Another manicured platform for Kamala to blurt out her now legendary word salads. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2298.14s)]

*  Still, these things cannot be overlooked. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2309.14s)]
*  These things cannot be overlooked. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2313.14s)]
*  And I have said many times publicly and I'll say it again, in many, many ways Donald Trump is an unserious man. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2315.14s)]
*  Yeah, an unserious man. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2323.14s)]
*  How rich coming from the candidate who is half Indian, half hyena. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2326.14s)]
*  But it's Trump who's the unserious person. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2333.14s)]
*  You know, the guy that built half the NYC skyline has already been president quite successfully, I might add. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2337.14s)]
*  The guy who raised a beautiful, successful family that anybody would be proud of. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2344.14s)]
*  A man who has literally taken a bullet for a job he didn't even need. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2348.14s)]
*  A man... [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2352.14s)]
*  A man... [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2354.14s)]
*  A man... [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2356.14s)]
*  Who our adversaries admit they respect and even fear. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2358.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's the unserious one, you dizzy dumbass. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2362.14s)]
*  And look at Liz Cheney sitting there. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2367.14s)]
*  She looks thrilled. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2371.14s)]
*  It's like she's thinking I quit my political party and all I got was this lousy wino. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2374.14s)]
*  But look, I watched the town hall for only one reason. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2381.14s)]
*  Hoping to hear one more time about the nature of a democracy where I think there's a duality. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2384.14s)]
*  The nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2391.14s)]
*  On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2395.14s)]
*  An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2402.14s)]
*  Oh, there's great strength in that. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2408.14s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2411.14s)]
*  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2415.14s)]
*  Oh, I never get tired of hearing that. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2418.14s)]
*  And she never gets tired of saying it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2424.14s)]
*  You know, I think that there's a duality to the nature of democracy. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2428.14s)]
*  When it's intact, oh, it's so strong. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2433.14s)]
*  So strong in its nature. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2438.14s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2441.14s)]
*  There's a duality to the nature of democracy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2445.14s)]
*  On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2449.14s)]
*  Incredibly strong. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2455.14s)]
*  And incredibly fragile. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2458.14s)]
*  The nature of democracy, there's a duality to it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2461.14s)]
*  On the one hand, it's very strong. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2465.14s)]
*  When a democracy is intact, it is also very fragile. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2469.14s)]
*  Look, Kamala, if you're going to recycle old crap, at least dress it up a bit. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2475.14s)]
*  Tyrus's idea is always bongos. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2482.14s)]
*  The nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2485.14s)]
*  On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2490.14s)]
*  An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2497.14s)]
*  Oh, there's great strength in that. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2504.14s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2507.14s)]
*  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2510.14s)]
*  Yep. Now, to most people, she sounds stupid. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2515.14s)]
*  But is she really? Jim Garrity at National Review suggests maybe she isn't. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2519.14s)]
*  He says the caricature of Kamala Harris as a bumbling dunce makes it easy to underestimate her. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2524.14s)]
*  It's kind of like how you root for Jesse Watters despite his glaring incompetence. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2529.14s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2534.14s)]
*  Jim also claims that her skill is really getting Democrats emotionally invested in her. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2537.14s)]
*  It certainly worked with Willie Brown. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2543.14s)]
*  But that's more than a joke. It's a fact. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2546.14s)]
*  That getting Dems emotionally invested in her means she gets others to do the work she won't do, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2549.14s)]
*  whether it's Willie Brown or willing Brown voters. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2555.14s)]
*  See what I did there? I know. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2560.14s)]
*  But I get what Jim's saying. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2563.14s)]
*  Don't just say, wow, she's just a dummy, because even if you're right, no one's going to hear it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2565.14s)]
*  People do the same thing with Trump. They overlook his actual deeds and focus on his words. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2570.14s)]
*  Take the latest. Trump calling Democrat leaders the enemy from within. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2575.14s)]
*  Congressman, do you consider Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi to be the enemy from within? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2580.14s)]
*  Donald Trump doubled down on his Hitler talking points about the enemy from within. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2584.14s)]
*  Donald Trump repeatedly referred to prominent Democrats and others on the left in the United States, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2589.14s)]
*  American citizens, as, quote, the enemy from within, unquote. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2595.14s)]
*  Donald Trump has been given opportunity after opportunity to either downplay or clarify his comments [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2599.14s)]
*  about what he called the enemy from within. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2604.14s)]
*  A major party candidate calling his political opponents, quote, the enemy within. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2607.14s)]
*  All that douchebag outrage. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2617.14s)]
*  Even though Democrats not only said the same thing about enemies within, but they actually acted on it. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2621.14s)]
*  Remember when these a-holes claimed there was extremism within our military? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2628.14s)]
*  It was big news until the threat was debunked and the story went away. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2632.14s)]
*  Or what about the scourge of white privilege and systemic racism that labeled the majority of people, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2636.14s)]
*  again, within the country, as oppressors and in need of serious reeducation [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2641.14s)]
*  that gave us a divided country, DEI, and a s*** ton of terrible Disney movies? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2646.14s)]
*  And don't ever forget what they did to anyone during the pandemic who dared to question their BS policies and their lies. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2652.14s)]
*  So save your outrage. Trump calling Pelosi and Schiff the enemy within is peanuts [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2659.14s)]
*  compared to calling tens of millions of Americans the enemy from within. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2663.14s)]
*  Hell, you even jailed a bunch of them while letting actual enemies from within, murderers, arsonists, and rapists, go free, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2667.14s)]
*  which created a new demand on the American public. We now must be diligent all the time. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2674.14s)]
*  When we're on the streets, on public transportation, about what our kids are being taught in school, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2679.14s)]
*  who's in our restrooms, who's coming into the country, it's a lot of pressure on us and we're ready to blow. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2683.14s)]
*  So that's why the town hall had to be orchestrated. You can't have ordinary people asking a phony candidate questions about the last four years. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2690.14s)]
*  It had to be stage managed, just like it was the last four years, because if you knew the truth, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2698.14s)]
*  then you'd see the enemy within in all its glory, and you'd toss it out on its lion ass. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2703.14s)]
*  If you're not going to do a compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2719.14s)]
