# Tomi Lahren: Trump can win in November if he hits on these two things
**Fox News:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U)
*  Here now with reaction, former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, the host of Outkicks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=0.0s)]
*  Tommy Lahren is fearless. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=5.0s)]
*  Tommy Lahren and Michigan Congressman John James, he was with President Trump in Michigan [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=6.28s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=11.76s)]
*  Tommy, let me begin with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=12.76s)]
*  You know, if you remember the big deal over targeted districts when governor, then vice [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=14.24s)]
*  presidential candidate Sarah Palin talked about it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=21.12s)]
*  OK, a term used by Democrats, Republicans alike. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=24.48s)]
*  OK, now the word bloodbath. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=27.92s)]
*  Joe Biden uses it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=31.2s)]
*  Donald Trump uses it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  He's calling for violence. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  It just shows how corrupt the media is. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=36.32s)]
*  What is your reaction to it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=38.48s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=40.48s)]
*  Today, former President Donald Trump reclaimed the narrative on the word bloodbath as he [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=43.16s)]
*  repeated it in reference to Joe Biden's border bloodbath, wherein Americans and migrants [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=48.32s)]
*  alike are dying at the hands of this administration's border policies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=54.56s)]
*  Donald Trump won the election in 2016 on immigration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=59.44s)]
*  His chant of build the wall resonated with voters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=63.92s)]
*  It resonated with Americans, because at that time we felt like we had an immigration crisis. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=66.72s)]
*  Now flash forward to where we are now and what we had back then looks like child's play. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=71.28s)]
*  Donald Trump can win the election in November if he hits on crime and illegal immigration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=76.0s)]
*  If he stays focused on those two issues, including the economy, he can win this election. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=81.4s)]
*  And he's going to reclaim these words. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=87.64s)]
*  He's not going to run from them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=89.12s)]
*  He's going to set the record straight, because that's what this president, our former president, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=90.48s)]
*  did. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  And that's what he's going to do again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  And that will lead him to victory if he stays on that message. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, you look at the human trafficking, the sex trafficking, the drug trafficking, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  the people coming from our top geopolitical foes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  And my understanding is your state of Michigan is urging residents to, what, adopt unvetted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden illegal immigrants and bring them into their home and you'll get a paycheck? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=116.12s)]
*  Tommy, you absolutely nailed it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  The things that we need to absolutely focus on are the things the president's focused [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  on. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Increase illegal immigration, increase crime. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Right now, Venezuela's crime has gone down 60 percent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=128.76000000000002s)]
*  You know where it's going up? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=131.84s)]
*  In American cities. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=133.08s)]
*  When you see all across the country that we don't just have a border crisis, that every [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=134.68s)]
*  state is a border state. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Every town is a border town. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=142.02s)]
*  And every day is October 6th like it was in Israel or September 10th like it was in the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  When you take a look at what Sean just said, when he mentioned that the risk of an imminent [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=153.0s)]
*  attack is there, it absolutely is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=157.64s)]
*  When you see what happened in Russia, when you see what's happening with Chinese illegals [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=159.55999999999997s)]
*  coming across, when you see what's happening in our communities, you look at this open [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  season on America. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  We just found 41 kilos of fentanyl in southeast Michigan today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=169.34s)]
*  Today, that's enough to kill 10.3 million people in the entire state of Michigan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=174.82s)]
*  And we're losing beautiful souls like Ruby Garcia, Jonathan Diller. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=179.62s)]
*  And we need to do everything that we can to make sure that we bring peace and make sure [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  that we secure our borders. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=189.34s)]
*  And Joe Biden is absolutely not doing it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=190.82s)]
*  I believe he's compromised. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=192.74s)]
*  And we need to have a new president November 5th. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=193.74s)]
*  OK, let me go to James Carville, Steve Miller, if I can, because I want to—as quote—usually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  when James Carville speaks, I think we should listen to him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=203.18s)]
*  And you have people like James Carville or Maureen Dowd and Van Jones and David Axelrod. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=206.38s)]
*  They've all in their own way been very critical of Biden and Carville talking about the Democratic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=212.22s)]
*  Party seeing horrifying numbers show a loss of young minority voters. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=216.98s)]
*  We have seen this in poll after poll. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=223.14s)]
*  The traditional base of the Democratic Party is eroding by 20 percentage points. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=225.42s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young Americans are leaving the Democratic Party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  Can you pinpoint the reason why, or is it a combination? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=238.42s)]
*  Is it law and order and safety and security and the border and the economy or national [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=241.82s)]
*  security, all of the above? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=247.38s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=248.94s)]
*  I think it's the fact that young people in this country under Biden do not see themselves [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=250.5s)]
*  as having the same future as their parents or anywhere close to it, including, of course, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=257.34s)]
*  minority voters, young black, young Hispanic, young Asian voters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=262.62s)]
*  People cannot afford to buy their first home. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=266.46s)]
*  People cannot afford to pay their rent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=268.84s)]
*  People do not have any money left over at the end of the month to save for the future. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=270.94s)]
*  You have students who went to college, took enormous debts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=275.56s)]
*  They can't find a job anywhere. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=278.54s)]
*  And then people who moved into cities, Democrat cities, thinking they would chase some kind [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=280.78s)]
*  of dream are living in filth. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=284.54s)]
*  They're living in degeneracy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=286.82s)]
*  They're living in crime. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=287.82s)]
*  And then they look, they watch as illegal aliens come into this country and steal their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=289.72s)]
*  dreams, their futures, their hopes, their safety, their security. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=294.3s)]
*  They see young women like Lakin Reilly getting beaten to death, murdered, murdered in cold [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=299.06s)]
*  blood and the alleged murderer and illegal alien freed into this country by Joe Biden, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=306.18s)]
*  a monster brought here by Joe Biden. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=312.38s)]
*  That is why this president is losing minority voters and losing young voters, because they [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=315.98s)]
*  saw under President Trump four years of unprecedented peace, stability and prosperity, the most [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  secure border, the strongest border in history. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=328.14s)]
*  And then they saw Joe Biden eradicate and steal from them, take from them all of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=330.94s)]
*  security, all the peace, all of the safety they have known and hurdle this ward towards [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=335.78s)]
*  the brink of a complete and total breakdown, not just in our security here, but the brink [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  of war breaking out amongst all the developed nations of the world. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=347.29999999999995s)]
*  You see now we are closer to World War Three than ever before. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=353.46s)]
*  You know, when you think, Congressman, how many more rapes are going to happen in this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=357.61999999999995s)]
*  country? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=362.17999999999995s)]
*  How many more murders will take place in this country? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=363.17999999999995s)]
*  How many more big drug busts are going to take place in this country? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=365.38s)]
*  How about the human trafficking, sex trafficking of young girls? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=372.18s)]
*  How much longer are people going to put up with this? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  And that raises the question, the state of Michigan will be pivotal in 216 days. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=379.36s)]
*  How do you see the people in Michigan in terms of their thinking about all of these issues? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=384.64s)]
*  When Donald Trump was president of the United States, we exported energy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=391.14s)]
*  We exported our culture. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, we're exporting our hope. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  We're exporting our jobs. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=397.26s)]
*  In the state of Michigan, we recognize that we are a border state, too, our northern border. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=398.9s)]
*  And of the 500 apprehensions on the FBI watch list, 86 percent are in northern border states, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=402.9s)]
*  states like New York, states like Michigan. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=410.29999999999995s)]
*  We recognize that President Biden is a threat to not just our security, but our economy, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  our ability to take care of our families and our futures. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=418.74s)]
*  And people in Michigan are waking up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=421.5s)]
*  You see all the polls in Michigan, because people understand what is at stake. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Mjwp_69U&t=423.5s)]
