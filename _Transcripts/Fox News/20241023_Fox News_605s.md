# Sean Hannity warns Dems are in panic mode: There's nothing they won't do to smear Trump
**Fox News:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU)
*  Early voting is now underway in almost every state. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=0.0s)]
*  You could say every day for the next 13 days, if there's voting going on, it is election [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=3.24s)]
*  day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=7.72s)]
*  So, get to the polls. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=8.72s)]
*  Take nothing for granted. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=10.34s)]
*  The margins, they are razor thin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=11.94s)]
*  The red wave never materialized in 2022. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=14.88s)]
*  There is not one person—let me be very clear about this—in this country today, with any [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=18.56s)]
*  degree of certainty that can tell you who is going to win this election. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=24.26s)]
*  And if you care about your country and the future direction of this country, my humble [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=30.18s)]
*  advice, especially if you live in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=34.94s)]
*  Arizona, Nevada, is to assume that your vote will determine the outcome of this election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=40.42s)]
*  I hope everybody will look at it as that important. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=46.1s)]
*  Now for the second straight day, no rallies for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=49.1s)]
*  Instead, she was in the Washington swamp using her vice presidential podium—oh, shocking—to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=52.54s)]
*  smear Donald Trump in how Kamala's once self-proclaimed joyful campaign—yeah, they have now reverted [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=58.94s)]
*  back to the same tired old tactics that we always see from Democrats in election years, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=65.66s)]
*  and it's almost like a permanent cycle, and that is smear, slander, besmirchment, lying, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=70.78s)]
*  oh, and have supporters comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and to Stalin and to Mussolini and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=76.18s)]
*  of course he's racist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=82.48s)]
*  Today Harris herself used a years-old, uncorroborated, bogus accusation from a former disgruntled [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  chief of staff to compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=91.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=94.64s)]
*  It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=95.64s)]
*  the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=103.16s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=111.28s)]
*  All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=114.28s)]
*  This is a window into who Donald Trump really is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  In May of 2018, that same person was praising Donald Trump on NPR. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=125.28s)]
*  Unfortunately Kamala gets zero points for creativity. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=134.16s)]
*  Let's have a little history lesson, a Hannity history lesson. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=135.16s)]
*  In 2008, Democrats, they compared John McCain to Hitler. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=138.56s)]
*  Four years later, Democratic strategist David Axelrod, he works at Fake News CNN, he compared [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=142.44s)]
*  Mitt Romney to Hitler. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=147.68s)]
*  Nikki Haley was compared to Hitler's girlfriend Ava Braun, and we could go on and on and on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=149.76s)]
*  It's a time-honored tradition of Democrats. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=156.32s)]
*  Comparing Republicans to Nazis is a tradition in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  When you have nothing else to run on, this is what you are left with. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=165.48s)]
*  In fact, just last week, the Atlantic actually compared Trump to Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=169.32s)]
*  the unholy trinity of evil dictators, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=177.32s)]
*  But remember, Donald Trump was president for four years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=180.2s)]
*  He started no new wars. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=183.04s)]
*  He signed a historic peace deal in the Middle East. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=184.78s)]
*  He lowered your taxes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  He cut regulation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=188.92s)]
*  He signed criminal justice reform. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  He secured our border. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  Not exactly the record of an evil, warmongering lover of Adolf Hitler and a madman. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=194.36s)]
*  And needless to say, the melodramatic comparisons to Hitler, they are falling flat, and they're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=200.56s)]
*  all predictable, and it's not going to stop there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=206.08s)]
*  It just will buckle up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=209.24s)]
*  It'll be an emotional rollercoaster ride. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=210.68s)]
*  The Democrats, their allies and the state-run media mob, they will be trying every day the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  tactic of slander, smear. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  We just found out after 10 years, Donald Trump did this and that, and just buckle up, because [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=220.8s)]
*  you know it's coming. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=226.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris cannot run on her terrible record or her far-left radical and extreme beliefs. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  So, smearing Donald Trump and calling him names, and frankly, those that support him, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  calling them names, is pretty much the only tool left in their political toolbox. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=241.24s)]
*  But per usual, Barack Obama is so perplexed, he's bewildered about how American politics [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=246.04s)]
*  have become so bitter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=252.32s)]
*  He did once talk about bitter people that cling to their God, guns, Bibles and religion, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  too. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=258.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=259.88s)]
*  As frustrating as politics can be sometimes, and I know it can be frustrating. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=260.88s)]
*  Look, I do not watch cable news. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=266.24s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=268.64s)]
*  There are times where I just, I don't understand how we got so toxic and just so divided and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=272.64s)]
*  so bitter, and I get why sometimes people just don't want to pay attention to it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=281.2s)]
*  Really Barack, let's do ourselves a favor. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=286.84s)]
*  Let's take a little walk down memory lane. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=289.68s)]
*  Maybe we can refresh your memory. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=292.84s)]
*  Maybe somebody will show this to you considering you don't watch cable news, although you mentioned [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=295.24s)]
*  me about 10 or 15 times when you were running for president. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=300.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=303.0s)]
*  I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=304.0s)]
*  He'll tear him up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=307.6s)]
*  If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you are president, you will accept [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=310.48s)]
*  their support after you're president. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=318.92s)]
*  You got their plan, which is let's have dirtier air, dirtier water, less people with health [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=322.08s)]
*  insurance. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=329.6s)]
*  I don't want to quell anger. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=330.6s)]
*  I think people are right to be angry. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm angry. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  I want you to talk to them whether they're independent or whether they are Republican. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  I want you to argue with them and get in their face. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Argue with them, get in their face. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  I have no idea how politics has gotten this way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=352.48s)]
*  I'm going to go to the next question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=356.64s)]

*  the best the Democratic Party, the best Kamala Harris can do is offer a more anti-Trump hysteria. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=404.64s)]
*  That is their favorite go-to. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=412.5s)]
*  That includes former comedian turned emotional Democratic sycophant Jimmy Kimmel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=414.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=419.52s)]
*  I'm an optimistic person. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=420.68s)]
*  I'm not hysterical. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=422.44s)]
*  I laugh when people say, oh, you've got Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=424.08s)]
*  If you're a reasonable person, you should have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=428.8s)]
*  And by the way, I think he has derangement syndrome about us, too. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=432.76s)]
*  The fact of the matter is this is a dangerous person. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=436.12s)]
*  No matter, no wonder nobody watches the show and Greg Gutfeld keeps kicking his ass. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=440.76s)]
*  Anyway, speaking of Trump derangement syndrome, poor Democratic strategist, our friend James [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=445.32s)]
*  Carville, he's getting more and more unglued every day. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=449.88s)]
*  Now he's comparing this election to slitting throats in World War II. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=453.4s)]
*  And I'm not making that up. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=459.0s)]
*  I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole thing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=461.48s)]
*  OK, I'm I'm I really don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans and the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=466.88s)]
*  Japanese. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=470.88s)]
*  I think we should have like snuck around them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=471.88s)]
*  And I think we should have, you know, gone behind them in lines and cut their throats, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=474.04s)]
*  because that was what was at stake. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=477.88s)]
*  I think we're literally approaching the same place right now. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=480.44s)]
*  I'm not talking about everybody stop. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=484.0s)]
*  Don't think I'm not talking about actually splitting a political opponent. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=487.48s)]
*  Don't fight fair, slit their throats. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=491.36s)]
*  But I don't mean actually, James, you may need to check with your doctor. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=495.16s)]
*  You may need to increase your daily dose of those gummies that you were talking about. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=500.2s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  Democrats, the Biden administration, they have tried to put Trump in jail. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=506.2s)]
*  They have tried to remove him from the ballot in multiple states. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=510.12s)]
*  They have pressured big tech companies to censor conservatives online. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=513.6s)]
*  They held a bogus primary that Biden won by millions of votes before the party elites [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=518.48s)]
*  decided to remove him from the top of the ticket and simply installed Kamala Harris [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=523.98s)]
*  in a last minute political coup. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=529.28s)]
*  Kamala herself has frequently called for the Senate filibuster to be eliminated so she [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  can ram through her radical agenda, like the radical Green New Deal, with ease. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=536.32s)]
*  Kamala is also apparently open to packing the U.S. Supreme Court, which would all but [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=541.2s)]
*  eliminate a co-equal branch of our government and corrupt our system of checks and balances. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=547.0s)]
*  Both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz routinely attack the First Amendment, and they want [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=553.7199999999999s)]
*  to unilaterally destroy the Second Amendment. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=558.04s)]
*  Maybe somebody could teach Tim how to load his own shotgun. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=560.76s)]
*  Anyway, Democrats want Americans, they want you, to believe that Trump is a threat to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=563.68s)]
*  democracy. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  the next 13 days, the smear, the slander, the lying, the besmirchment, the attacks will [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=572.64s)]
*  get worse hour after hour after hour. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=579.16s)]
*  Here's only one question that really matters. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=583.08s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=586.48s)]
*  That very question is a big problem for Kamala Harris. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=589.88s)]
*  She cannot get it anywhere else. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNHJQmawRU&t=601.64s)]
