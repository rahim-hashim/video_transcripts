# USAID has been ‘exposed’ as the funding mechanism for the radical left, says Stephen Miller
**Fox News:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU)
*  Here with reaction, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=0.0s)]
*  Before we get to Pam Bondi, I'll scroll what I did last night, all of the hundreds [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=5.14s)]
*  of millions and billions of dollars that they have wasted. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=10.92s)]
*  They're not spending it in America, and they're spending it for the most radical [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=14.36s)]
*  policies that no American would support this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=17.92s)]
*  And they're calling it a threat to our Constitution. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=21.8s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=23.64s)]
*  USAID has been exposed as the funding mechanism for the radical left here and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=27.04s)]
*  around the world. The reason why the Democrats are up in arms is that Donald [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=33.92s)]
*  Trump exposed their scheme. They've been using USAID to line their pockets, to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=37.58s)]
*  line the pockets of radical left Marxist organizations, to fund gender studies in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=42.96s)]
*  Albania, diversity, equity and inclusion all over the world, to fund [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  radical left illegal immigration, open borders groups that support the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=53.08s)]
*  dissolution of national borders. They're even funding left-wing media [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=57.32s)]
*  organizations here in the United States. The radical left in this country are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=60.64s)]
*  federal employees. In other words, they are sponsored and paid by the federal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  government. These non-governmental organizations are all subsidized by [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=70.32s)]
*  American taxpayer dollars. So if you ever wonder where's the radical left coming [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=74.56s)]
*  from? Who's paying for all this BS? How is it possible there's so much [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=78.56s)]
*  insanity in our corporations, in our schools? It's because your tax dollars [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=82.52s)]
*  have been funding it and Donald Trump is shutting it down. I mean I don't think [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=86.72s)]
*  there's one American that would ever support any of this money being spent. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=92.16s)]
*  How were they able to hide it? And thank God Elon Musk and Donald Trump, the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=96.6s)]
*  president, are exposing this and informing the American people with it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=101.84s)]
*  Their money? Why isn't this money going to people in North Carolina? Why isn't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=105.6s)]
*  it going to people in California? Why isn't it going to people in Florida, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=110.2s)]
*  Tennessee, South Carolina? Why isn't it going to poor people in America? Exactly, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=113.08s)]
*  Sean. We have in America veterans under Joe Biden who couldn't afford housing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=119.28s)]
*  We had in America under Joe Biden Americans in North Carolina who lost [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=125.2s)]
*  everything they had, who couldn't even get temporary shelter. And then you have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=131.04s)]
*  USAID funding communist nonsense in foreign countries all over the world, not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=135.4s)]
*  to mention pushing all kinds of crazy plots on regime change and destabilizing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=141.8s)]
*  foreign governments. It's a playground for the swamp while our own people hurt [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=146.4s)]
*  and suffer. And Donald Trump came in and he said we're gonna put America first [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=150.88s)]
*  and he is putting America first and that's why the American people are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  celebrating this presidency every single day. And by the way, Rom Rombo Deadfish [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=157.28s)]
*  and Axelrod are not wrong, but I actually am encouraging Democrats to double down [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=162.28s)]
*  on Dumb and Dumber. Pam Bondi, now our Attorney General, she issued orders to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=166.56s)]
*  fight the weaponization of justice, work with DHS to eliminate the cartels, lift [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=172.32s)]
*  the death penalty, and my favorite crackdown on sanctuary cities and states [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  ordering the DOJ to pause all of their federal funding. Why shouldn't they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=181.12s)]
*  pause it when we both know that they're aiding and abetting and law-breaking? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=185.72s)]
*  Exactly. Well, let's take the last one first. Sanctuary cities shield criminal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=192.36s)]
*  organizations. They shield train deragua. They shield MS-13. They shield drug [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=197.8s)]
*  cartels. The cartels that Donald Trump is correctly and finally labeling as [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=203.88s)]
*  foreign terrorist organizations. Federal taxpayer dollars should not be used to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=208.4s)]
*  subsidize cities and governments that shelter terrorists and criminals that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=214.04s)]
*  are murdering our citizens by the thousands. Donald Trump is going to shut [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  that down. You also mentioned that the new Attorney General, Pam Bondi, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=225.6s)]
*  following President Trump's day one executive orders, has made it clear that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=230.32s)]
*  her department's mission will center on eradicating those criminal cartels in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=233.88s)]
*  partnership with DHS and also partnership with DOD, which of course is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  being led now by the great Pete Hickseth. And so you have seen in just the last [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=243.76s)]
*  few weeks how President Trump has already shut down the southern border, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=248.92s)]
*  the financial lifeblood of those criminal cartels. And then we are now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=253.6s)]
*  beginning and accelerating the process of uprooting these cartels from our [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=257.4s)]
*  communities and deporting them out of our country and keeping them out of our [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=261.32s)]
*  country. And when we have to and we find drugs and we find evidence of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=265.0s)]
*  criminality, then they will spend a very long time in jail as well, too. Maybe in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=268.96s)]
*  jail here, maybe in jail in El Salvador or some other foreign country. But what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=272.92s)]
*  they're not going to do is menace our citizens anymore. By the way, is it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=277.52s)]
*  weaponization if you investigate the Biden family syndicate and you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=282.44s)]
*  investigate zero experience Hunter being paid millions with no experience at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=287.52s)]
*  a time he's addicted to drugs and money he admits on his laptop he gave to Pops? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=292.28s)]
*  Is that weaponization or is that law and order? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=297.52s)]
*  Pam will follow the laws of the United States and she will hold those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=301.96s)]
*  accountable who must be held accountable and she will stop government from [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  targeting conservatives and Christians and traditional Americans under [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=310.0s)]
*  President Trump. We will have justice. We will have accountability and we will [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=313.76s)]
*  have honest government once again. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=317.04s)]
*  All right, Stephen Miller. We always love having you. Thank you, sir. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Xq0fukLZU&t=319.32s)]
