*  Police found her body in a wooded area near the UGA campus in Athens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7yr03t8DzE&t=11.6s)]
*  They say she did have visible injuries. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7yr03t8DzE&t=15.92s)]

*  to dangerous Venezuelan gangs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7yr03t8DzE&t=43.12s)]
