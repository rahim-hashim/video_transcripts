# 'UNHINGED LOSER': Hannity rips into host who mocked Tesla attacks
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek)
*  And I guess in the case of Nancy Pelosi, no reason for her to speak out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=0.0s)]
*  Probably she and her husband didn't own any Tesla stock. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=4.24s)]
*  Why would they care? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=6.92s)]
*  We have many prominent figures on the left celebrating this new wave of domestic terrorism [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=8.1s)]
*  and frankly fanning the flames. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=12.72s)]
*  Naturally, this includes the lowest rated, by the way, officially on cancellation watch [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=14.64s)]
*  notice, and most emotional late night host, our old friend, that jerk, Jimmy Kimmel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=19.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=26.32s)]
*  Tesla stock is way down, almost disastrously so. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=27.72s)]
*  People have been vandalizing Tesla vehicles, new Tesla vehicles. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=31.32s)]
*  Please don't vandalize, don't ever vandalize Tesla vehicles. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=39.64s)]
*  And so Elon Musk has been making the rounds in the right wing media to try to appear to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=44.72s)]
*  be a human being. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=51.0s)]
*  That's supposed to be clever. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=53.32s)]
*  Now, Jimmy Kimmel's show is owned and run by ABC Disney, and Disney's run by a guy [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=54.8s)]
*  by the name of Bob Iger. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=61.8s)]
*  Bob, are you okay with this seeming glorification of violence? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=63.8s)]
*  Is this the inclusive, woke DEI, the ABC Disney brand? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=70.52s)]
*  Now think about it, Jimmy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=75.72s)]
*  You know, he sobs, he weeps when an election doesn't go his way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=77.24s)]
*  He demands compassion if he's having problems in his personal life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=81.28s)]
*  But yet, ABC Disney, Bob Iger, allow a host, in my opinion, to be celebrating what has [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=85.08s)]
*  been happening to Tesla against regular Americans that drive Teslas, making jokes about it all? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=91.28s)]
*  Bob Iger, you're the CEO of Disney. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=98.64s)]
*  Are you proud of this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=101.08s)]
*  Jimmy Kimmel is an unhinged loser. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=102.88s)]
*  You see the ratings every day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=105.56s)]
*  We all see the ratings every day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  He's, you know, pretending to be woke, compassionate, while cheering for, you know, those that are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=109.08s)]
*  involved in these actions against Tesla, against his political enemies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=114.44s)]
*  Now, by the way, don't forget, before Jimmy's rebirth as ABC's woke hall monitor, Kimmel [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=119.28s)]
*  was the host of The Man Show. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=125.32s)]
*  That's where he wore blackface. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=127.36s)]
*  That's where he sexually, in my opinion, harassed women for kicks and giggles. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=129.0s)]
*  We report, you decide. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=133.64s)]
*  Do you remember this, Jimmy? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=134.84s)]
*  This game show is called Guess What's In My Pants. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=137.72s)]
*  Now, I've stuffed something in my pants, and you're allowed to feel around on the outside [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=140.68s)]
*  of the pants. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=146.04s)]
*  You have ten seconds to then guess what is in my pants. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=147.04s)]
*  You ready? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=151.32s)]
*  Set. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=152.32s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=153.32s)]
*  It looks fun. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=154.32s)]
*  You should use two hands. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=155.32s)]
*  Call him alone, never see no flying saucer himself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=157.32s)]
*  But if he do, that's going to be a spooky time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=160.6s)]
*  ABC Disney, inclusive as all can be, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  That's ABC Disney's guy, the guy who seems to insinuate the violence against Tesla owners [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=168.76s)]
*  is somehow something to be joked about and funny or, you know, righteous. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=173.88s)]
*  Bob Iger, does Mickey Mouse approve this message? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=179.72s)]
*  Just think about the last 24 hours. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=183.04s)]
*  We witnessed an amazing moment in history. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=184.76s)]
*  President Trump, Elon Musk, the team at SpaceX, they rescued two American astronauts on live [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=187.16s)]
*  television. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=192.32s)]
*  They were only supposed to be there for eight days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=193.32s)]
*  They were there for 286 days. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=195.16s)]
*  The SpaceX capsule splashed down right on time in the Gulf of America on a bright, beautiful, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=197.32s)]
*  sunny day right off the coast of the free state, my state of Florida. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=202.68s)]
*  There were even dolphins there to greet the astronauts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  This is the result of years of hard work, incredible ingenuity, engineering, dedication, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  and frankly sheer genius. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrSIwxVhek&t=215.07999999999998s)]
