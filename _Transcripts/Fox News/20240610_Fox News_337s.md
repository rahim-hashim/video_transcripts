# Americans, Virginians are ‘ready for change’: Glenn Youngkin
**Fox News:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8)
*  All right, this is huge. According to the latest Fox poll in the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, Joe Biden, this is the second poll in a row tied at 48%. Remember, this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=6.96s)]
*  is a place Joe Biden won by 10 points in 2020. The same poll shows Trump winning 25% of black [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=12.32s)]
*  voters in the Commonwealth of Virginia right now. Can Republicans consider Virginia in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=19.36s)]
*  play come November? Joining us with more, Virginia Governor Glenn Young. Governor, listen, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  your victory really shocked the world in many ways because a lot of people like myself included [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=31.2s)]
*  thought that Virginia had gone solidly blue, that Northern Virginia had too many DC employees that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=37.28s)]
*  were going to vote for the bureaucracy and it became that much more difficult of a state to win. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  Is this state in play for Donald Trump? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=49.28s)]
*  Sean, I believe it is and that's exactly what the polls are showing us. Just like Georgia and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, those battleground states are seeing the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  exact same kind of statement that Virginians are making. They want a strong America. They want an [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=68.08s)]
*  America that has economic strength, not the Biden generated economy that's unleashed inflation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=74.4s)]
*  They want an America that has national security strength, not the indecisive, weak America that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=80.24s)]
*  Joe Biden has created. They want an America that has a secure border, not one that has [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  terrorists and illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing over it every day. I mean, we see it in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=90.72s)]
*  Virginia. We literally have five Virginians dying on average from fentanyl overdose and we had two [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=95.6s)]
*  illegal immigrants crash the gates at Quantico in a box truck recently and they want an America [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=101.36s)]
*  that has energy independence. We're so tired, I can hear it every single day, of being told that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=107.92s)]
*  you have to buy an EV if you live in California but not in Virginia anymore because we declared [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=114.08s)]
*  our independence or that in fact you have to pay 20, 30, 40 percent more for a gallon of gas because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=119.68s)]
*  of the Biden failed energy policy. They want Trump back in the White House because he built a strong [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=127.6s)]
*  America and that's exactly what we've seen in Virginia over the course of the last couple years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=133.92s)]
*  Common sense conservative policy works. We've unleashed a rip-roaring economy in Virginia and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=138.72s)]
*  I think they want to see it on a national level. Yes, Virginia is in play. We got five months of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=144.0s)]
*  hard work but I'm telling you when they put the records of President Trump against [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  President Biden, I believe that Virginians and Americans are going to find themselves pulling [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  the lever for President Trump. So when I was with President Trump last week and I did an interview [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=159.44s)]
*  with him, your name came up and he asked me if I spoke to you often. I said well occasionally, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  you know, we have spoken and you come on the show and he said when you talk to him, tell him [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=170.32s)]
*  I'm going to give him a call. I want his thoughts on Virginia. So I would say expect a call from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=176.16s)]
*  President Trump. I don't know, I'm just a mere messenger, right? You know, what about Northern [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=181.6s)]
*  Virginia because that always scares me because there are so many DC bureaucrats that live in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=187.28s)]
*  Commonwealth of Virginia that work in DC and how big a percentage of the vote is that going to end [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=195.6s)]
*  up being for the Commonwealth? Well in order to win Virginia like we did in 2021, you have to lose [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=202.24s)]
*  Northern Virginia less badly and what we did of course was we won the Hispanic vote, we won the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=211.2s)]
*  Asian vote, we won the independent vote. People are ready for change and in 2021 they were ready [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=217.2s)]
*  to see parents put back at the head of the table, back in control, control their children's lives. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  They were tired of government taking all of their hard-earned money and putting it in government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  coffers versus leaving it in their pocket. They wanted a chance to build their lives the way they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=233.44s)]
*  wanted to build them and not being told what to do all the time, mandated masks and oh by the way, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=238.48s)]
*  mandate what kind of car you drive. This is Virginia and of course I think this is America [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=244.08s)]
*  and therefore the plan to win Virginia is of course to lose Northern Virginia less bad but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  to get over 40 percent of the vote and then knock it out in the rest of the state and that's exactly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  what we did in 2021 and when you look at President Trump's strength across Virginia that's exactly [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=262.0s)]
*  what he can do. Let me ask you a final question. If Donald Trump and I know your name has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=268.24s)]
*  been out there prominently but if Donald Trump called you and asked you to run with him what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=273.92s)]
*  would you say Governor? Well first I would be honored and humbled and tell him that there is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=277.92s)]
*  a ton of talent in the Republican Party today and I've seen them everywhere and it's my job to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=285.36s)]
*  finish my finish my time as Governor and help him win Virginia but I tell you what we got to make [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=291.6s)]
*  sure we get Donald Trump back in the White House because America can't withstand another four years [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=296.88s)]
*  of Joe Biden. Is that a hard no? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=300.96s)]
*  Sean that is a realistic view of the fact that there is so much talent that I think he can have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=307.44s)]
*  a great choice and find lots of people. I think I can ask this for another... I would be honored [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=313.68s)]
*  but if they... I understand. All right Governor, always great to have you on the program. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=318.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6WzvrdrxY8&t=330.96s)]
