# Vivek Ramaswamy: We have a 'lobotomized' president in the White House
**Fox News:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI)
*  Here's reaction former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Vivek, I'm stunned by this moment with the reporter. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=6.26s)]
*  That was Josh Wingrow from Bloomberg that asked about Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=10.06s)]
*  I am not typically complimentary of the White House press corps. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=13.82s)]
*  Go watch my 2020 press briefings. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=16.66s)]
*  However, they asked some good questions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=18.66s)]
*  And yet Biden totally exploded. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=21.54s)]
*  News to Biden, Vivek. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=24.78s)]
*  You're about to meet Donald Trump in T-minus 14 days. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=26.42s)]
*  Get ready, buddy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=29.1s)]
*  Well, the reality is it's embarrassing as an American. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=32.1s)]
*  Forget the partisan politics of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=34.6s)]
*  To see this as the commander in chief, the president of the United States, and at least [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=36.36s)]
*  once that used to be the president and leader of the free world as we know it, behaving [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=40.08s)]
*  in this way looks like we have a lobotomized president sitting in the White House today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=44.78s)]
*  I think it's a national embarrassment regardless of your partisan affiliation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=49.36s)]
*  The reality though, Kayleigh, is I think that that 14-day-from-now debate, 13-day-from-now [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=52.96s)]
*  debate is really the final step for Biden. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=56.96s)]
*  Either he steps up and surpasses expectations, or that's the final hurdle they're making [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=60.22s)]
*  him jump through as a condition for getting the DNC nomination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=64.5s)]
*  So the reality is if he behaves that way as he did at the G7, I expect we're going to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=68.7s)]
*  be looking at a new nominee for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=72.58s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=75.54s)]
*  You know, Vivek, you're a brilliant communicator, probably the best we have in the party at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=76.54s)]
*  the moment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=81.58s)]
*  And, you know, you've stood on the debate stage. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=82.58s)]
*  You've gone toe-to-toe with others. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=84.92s)]
*  And I'm curious, you know, there were low expectations for Biden with the State of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  Union. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  He did jump over those low expectations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you think whatever he did, I don't know if it was like a Red Bull, whatever that routine [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  was, can he jump over that same hurdle on a debate stage or is it a totally different [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=97.04s)]
*  dynamic? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=101.12s)]
*  I think it's a totally different animal reading from a teleprompter and using your vocal chords [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  to actually scream at the television screen versus actually being able to think on your [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=107.48s)]
*  feet while you're engaging with the heart of what somebody's saying. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=112.4s)]
*  I think the American people, especially on a one-on-one debate, are going to be able [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  to see through the artifice they've otherwise been projecting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=118.08s)]
*  President Trump, I think, has been doing an outstanding job of showing up in places where [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=121.84s)]
*  he's not been expected to show up, from the South Bronx to the Libertarian Convention [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=125.2s)]
*  in D.C., where I was as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=129.54s)]
*  Those are audiences where Republicans traditionally may not be comfortable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=132.16s)]
*  So he's warmed up and perfectly ready to face somebody in an uncomfortable circumstance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=135.8s)]
*  Biden's facing scripted questions and accusing reporters of breaking the rules, his words [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=140.46s)]
*  not mine, for asking questions that go outside of his script. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=144.98s)]
*  So do I believe CNN's going to do everything in their power to make Biden look as good [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=148.62s)]
*  as he possibly can? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=152.38s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=154.02s)]
*  That's the purpose of this debate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=155.02s)]
*  But even still, the second purpose is for this to serve as the final hurdle, where if [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=156.02s)]
*  he fails even that easiest of tests, I do believe, Kayleigh, there is a real possibility [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=160.02s)]
*  we'll be looking at another Democratic nominee later this summer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=164.94s)]
*  Okay, so let's tease that out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=167.9s)]
*  So Brett Stevens at The New York Times wrote a piece this week that if Biden wants to win, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=169.8s)]
*  he needs to step aside. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=173.68s)]
*  You had The Atlantic, a liberal publication, call him Ruth Bader Biden, insinuating he [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=175.56s)]
*  needs to learn when to exit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=181.16s)]
*  You've had James Carville, bad comments about Biden and his abilities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=183.08s)]
*  So there is this clarion call from the liberal press and from some on the left that this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=187.96s)]
*  shouldn't be the nominee. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=192.08s)]
*  So tease this out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=193.52s)]
*  How does this happen? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=194.52s)]
*  He has a disastrous debate performance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=195.52s)]
*  There's just public pressure. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=196.64s)]
*  He steps aside. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=197.64s)]
*  Is he forced aside? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=198.9s)]
*  How does that look? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=199.9s)]
*  I think it's between then and the convention, Kayleigh. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  The reality is anything can happen before the convention. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=204.9s)]
*  They've said it in August. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=207.74s)]
*  I believe the other side actually knows what they're doing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=209.18s)]
*  If they get another nominee too early, that's enough time for vetting, enough time for the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=211.62s)]
*  honeymoon phase to fade. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=215.66s)]
*  But if they're swapping in another nominee in August, say right around the time of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=217.26s)]
*  convention, that's the best case scenario for them because you get the honeymoon phase [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=221.26s)]
*  with the new candidate without the scrutiny that comes with it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=224.62s)]
*  So I'm not saying that's definitely going to happen, but play this out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  This is the earliest presidential debate in American history and the first ever to my [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  knowledge that has taken place before the nominating convention of either party. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  Ask yourself why they're doing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=239.44s)]
*  And more importantly, ask yourself why the Democrats made it a condition of Biden debating [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=241.12s)]
*  that they placed that date that early. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=246.0s)]
*  You got to skate to where the puck is going. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's why I think it's so important, Kayleigh, that we not fixate on Joe Biden. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  We have to stand for our own vision. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=254.56s)]
*  I spoke in Detroit, Michigan earlier today at the TPUSA event. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=256.34s)]
*  I think it's great when Republicans show up in the inner cities of this country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=259.9s)]
*  My message to that group was, regardless of which puppet they put up, we have to decide [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=263.9s)]
*  what we stand for as conservatives and as Americans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=268.74s)]
*  That's how we're going to win this election, not by fixating on Biden because there's a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=272.78s)]
*  good chance it may not even be him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Wise advice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=278.46s)]
*  Just a few moments here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=279.46s)]
*  But do they leapfrog Kamala and someone else comes in? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=280.46s)]
*  So this is a great difficulty for the Democratic Party. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  The smartest decision that Joe, or maybe it was Jill, Biden actually made was selecting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris as the VP. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=291.4s)]
*  The only thing worse than Joe Biden for the Democratic Party would having Kamala Harris [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=293.2s)]
*  in that seat. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  However, I think they will be able to sidestep that problem, perhaps by making her the VP [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  again on a ticket, or else by bowing to the temple of identity politics, by at least going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  with another candidate who checks certain boxes that the modern Democratic Party requires [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=306.44s)]
*  you to check. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  She's in charge of AI policy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm pretty certain she can't even spell AI, and I think most Americans, even most Democrats, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=313.26s)]
*  see that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  So I doubt they'll put her up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  I think it's going to be somebody else, and somebody else who might actually have a greater [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  functioning intellect than either Kamala or Joe Biden, which is setting a low bar, but [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=322.58s)]
*  is nonetheless what we need to be prepared for. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=327.38s)]
*  It is an interesting time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  Vivek, thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=330.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKLEJ11hsjI&t=343.24s)]
