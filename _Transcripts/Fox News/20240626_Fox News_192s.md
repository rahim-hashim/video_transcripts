# Alina Habba: Don't get it twisted, this is not fair and square
**Fox News:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ)
*  Earlier today, Judge Juan Mershon lifted part of former President Trump's gag order from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=0.0s)]
*  his falsifying business records trial. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=6.16s)]
*  Also today, a big update in the documents case in Florida. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=8.36s)]
*  Here with reaction, Trump legal spokeswoman Alina Haba is with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=11.9s)]
*  All right, a lot going on today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=15.44s)]
*  Let's get a full update, Alina. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=17.2s)]
*  Sure, Sean, thank you for having me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, we have the absolute ridiculousness where they try and make it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=22.6s)]
*  sound like Judge Mershon is being politically unbiased. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=27.36s)]
*  We know that's not the case. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=30.8s)]
*  We had a partial win in the First Amendment gag order where he allowed the president to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=32.38s)]
*  now speak about witnesses. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=37.56s)]
*  Remember, President Trump is the only person being gagged here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=39.28s)]
*  He is the only political candidate that is being gagged. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Witnesses themselves weren't gagged. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=47.46s)]
*  So we have Judge Mershon now after the trial, after people like Michael Cohen could go [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=48.94s)]
*  on MSDNC and all the rest and talk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=55.08s)]
*  Now they say, oh, hey, you were convicted by a New York blue jury, but now you can talk. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=58.16s)]
*  Don't get it twisted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=64.6s)]
*  This is what they're doing to make the American people think that everything is fair and square [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=65.6s)]
*  when we know it is not. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=69.36s)]
*  It's much like Hunter Biden, who's still walking around freely despite the sham of a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=71.0s)]
*  trial that they had for him to make them look like they're not biased. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=75.36s)]
*  So then on top of that, Sean, we had the DOJ and, you know, Jack Smith, who we do not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=78.8s)]
*  believe is even a valid special counsel, who wasn't appointed properly, shouldn't be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=85.36s)]
*  in the position, now asking for yet another gag order. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=89.96s)]
*  It's no different than what we're going to see on Thursday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=94.64s)]
*  They are orchestrating everything through courts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=97.0s)]
*  If they can't hype up and hop up Joe Biden, they'll just make sure they silence President [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=99.78s)]
*  Trump while they go after him politically in the courtrooms. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=104.4s)]
*  We're seeing it time and time again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=107.58s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=109.58s)]
*  This week's about the debate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=111.66s)]
*  Next week will be about, well, the week after next will be about the sentencing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=113.42s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't put anything past Mershawn. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=117.74s)]
*  Think he'll try and put President Trump in jail in the middle of a presidential campaign [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=121.42s)]
*  leading into his convention? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=125.82s)]
*  No, I wouldn't put it past him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=128.22s)]
*  We're going to see what they recommend from the prosecution side. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=131.9s)]
*  Obviously, there's some back and forth. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=134.42s)]
*  But I don't put anything past them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=136.3s)]
*  If you recall a few weeks ago, after the trial, someone spoke on The View and said, I've spoken [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=138.12s)]
*  to people in the prosecutor's office, in Alvin Bragg's office, and I've heard that they're [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  going to recommend one year at Rikers. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=147.34s)]
*  First and foremost, why are you speaking to anybody from the DA's office? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=150.5s)]
*  Secondly, the fact is, I wouldn't put any of that past them, Sean. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=154.78s)]
*  They couldn't beat him when they put him in court. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  They couldn't beat him when they put gag orders on every single case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=161.36s)]
*  But now, they're going to try and jail him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=165.58s)]
*  I don't doubt it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=167.5s)]
*  It will literally cause an uproar in this country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=168.84s)]
*  They cannot do it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  It would be ridiculously desperate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  But hey, they are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=174.86s)]
*  They can't win. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  Biden's their candidate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  Alina, thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_5OWXBR4uQ&t=178.14000000000001s)]
