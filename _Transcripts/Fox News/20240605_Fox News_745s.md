# Trump warns Biden could lead US into WWIII
**Fox News:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM)
*  And here is part four of my interview with former president Donald Trump. Take a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. Wall Street Journal, big article. Democrats are worried. You keep reading. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=5.04s)]
*  Democrats are in a state of panic. Democrats are in a state of panic. And now it's something that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  we have covered at length on this program, and that is Joe Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=16.32s)]
*  Now Democrats are saying it, and they're saying it out loud. And let me play you a clip of Joe [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=20.88s)]
*  and get your reaction to it. And then I'm going to butt it together with a different Joe. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=29.28s)]
*  And I called him the night after a State of the Union address, jacked up Joe. Maybe he had a lot [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=34.88s)]
*  of Red Bull or Monster Energy drink. Or something. Or something. Take a look. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=39.36s)]
*  I've been a senator since I was 29 years old. Never left government. In the fall, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=46.0s)]
*  he had tied that fall. He decided to look, I shouldn't get into this problem. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=51.52s)]
*  Never forget America is the strongest when we lead not only by our example of our power, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=59.2s)]
*  but by the power of our example. You can clap for that. As President Lincoln said, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=64.16s)]
*  we'll never forget lying around and us him, him lying around actually. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=72.64s)]
*  They're trying to erase black history. We're going to write black history because it's American [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=80.08s)]
*  history. On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a black man. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=84.72s)]
*  Just checking this afternoon. Good afternoon. We'll not bring Israel, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=92.08s)]
*  we'll not bring down, bogged out, we'll only bog down Israel and Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=98.08s)]
*  Is Steny here? Where's Steny Hoyer? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=110.96s)]
*  I hear him in the back. He's drinking, he's over by the beer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=116.08s)]
*  Well, Steny Hoyer lives on the western shore of Delaware in Maryland. The thing about, I'll just, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=120.72s)]
*  let me put it this way. I remember when I was Vice President and things weren't going too well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=128.4s)]
*  The United Kingdom is on the brink. Now our economy is literally the envy of the world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=134.24s)]
*  Too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=140.8s)]
*  That's why we're cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=149.12s)]
*  Wall Street didn't build America. They're not bad guys. They didn't build it, though. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=153.84s)]
*  The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Wages keep going up, inflation keeps coming down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=161.6s)]
*  Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3%, the lowest in the world and 10% even lower. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=164.64s)]
*  So most days you see Joe struggling. Now Democrats are saying it. But State of the Union, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=172.56s)]
*  we saw a very different, in my view, Joe. Maybe just Red Bull, I don't know. I'm not going to make [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=180.32s)]
*  any allegations, but it certainly was not the normal Biden. How significant an issue is this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=185.2s)]
*  Look, we are- [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=193.6s)]
*  Because I don't think he could sit here and have this conversation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=195.6s)]
*  Right. We're at the most dangerous point in the history of our country because of the power of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  weaponry, nuclear weapons in particular, weapons that are so powerful that, and I've seen the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=202.56s)]
*  effects. And I had an uncle, a great professor at MIT for many years. We used to talk about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=209.6s)]
*  nuclear a lot. He understood nuclear very well. And even then, that was many years ago, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=214.96s)]
*  my father's brother, Dr. John Trump. And I think he was the longest-serving [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=220.4s)]
*  professor in the history of MIT, I think 41 years. Very smart. We used to talk about nuclear. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=225.28s)]
*  And he used to talk about the power of nuclear. And I'd say, Uncle John, you're done. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=231.84s)]
*  We're a briefcase the size of a regular briefcase would do damage that I don't even want to discuss. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=236.16s)]
*  And we're a long way from that in terms of the advancement of that technology. And it's very bad, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=243.76s)]
*  very scary. And I will tell you, we have a chance of going into World War III because of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=249.68s)]
*  our leader. So I don't want to get into what state he's in. In one way, it's not something for me to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=255.84s)]
*  talk about. I can tell you this. President Xi of China, Putin, Kim Jong-un, all of these leaders [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=264.64s)]
*  are at the top of their game. Mentally, they're at the top of their game. And they're dealing with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=272.4s)]
*  somebody that's not at the top of his game. And honestly, he never was. He was never the brightest [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  bulb. And everybody understands that. Everybody knows that. You look at his foreign policy over [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  the years, it was always wrong. You look at all of the things, you look at his crime bill in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=288.96s)]
*  1990s, how horrible that was to certain groups of people. He was never great at what he did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  He did it because he was hail and hearty and well met. And I have a real problem. I love this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=303.76s)]
*  country. I don't want to see this country get into a nuclear war and be so badly damaged. What we say [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=311.2s)]
*  won't matter. This won't matter. This place won't matter. Nothing will matter because practically [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=317.92s)]
*  nothing's going to be here anymore. The level of power, the level of power with the weapons and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  weaponry, that's real weaponry. That's worse than the weaponry that we were talking about a little [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=329.2s)]
*  while ago. This is the ultimate. This is obliteration, maybe world obliteration. And we have a man that is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  not capable of even discussing it. He talked the other night about that nuclear doesn't matter so [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=341.76s)]
*  much. What matters is, think of this, global warming. The only global warming that matters to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=350.48s)]
*  me is nuclear global warming because that's the real deal. He said it's an existential threat. He [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=356.32s)]
*  loves the words existential threat. That global warming is an existential threat. And he doesn't [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  know why. What is it? It's weather. And I'm all for that. You know what? I'm in a certain way, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=370.24s)]
*  in a very powerful way, I'm an environmentalist. I'm all, I want clean air, I want clean water. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  But this is not the existential threat. Tomorrow we could have a war that will be so devastating [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=381.36s)]
*  that you could never recover from it. Nobody can. The whole world won't be able to recover from it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=387.04s)]
*  And he's talking about something in 400 years from now. The oceans will rise by an eighth of an inch. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Look, we have a man that shouldn't be doing this job. He's not qualified. He's not mentally sharp [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=396.8s)]
*  enough. And I don't believe he was 20 years ago either. You know, they can show me clips. Take a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=402.88s)]
*  look at the clips of how he did 20 years ago. His level of hatred for me is incredible. But all I'm [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=407.04s)]
*  trying to do is lay out the facts. Lay out the facts. We have to have somebody that's sharp and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  strong. And Victor Orban, who's a very strong kind of a guy, I guess, they call him a strong man. Or [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=418.16s)]
*  Trump likes, I don't like strong men or hate strong men. He's leading a country. He's a strong [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=424.16s)]
*  leader. He's the prime minister of Hungary. He said the only way we're going to solve the problems [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=428.56s)]
*  of the world, you got to bring Trump back. China was afraid of him. Russia was afraid of him. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=433.36s)]
*  Look, I ended the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2, before I came in. Even you. Nobody ever heard [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=438.16s)]
*  of Nord Stream 2. I said they're building Nord Stream 2. Everyone said, what is that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=443.12s)]
*  It's the biggest pipeline in the world going to Germany. So we're protecting Germany. And Germany [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  is paying billions of dollars a month to Russia for energy. And I also said it's bad for Germany [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=452.48s)]
*  because if they ever do end up with a war, which they have many times, they'll turn off the juice [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=458.48s)]
*  and Germany doesn't have a chance. That's when I gave Angela Merkel a white flag. You remember I [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=463.12s)]
*  sent over a white flag at a table. She said, what is it that's the flag of surrender? So we need a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  president that's sharp and that's respected. And we're closer to World War Three. Now you take a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=474.0s)]
*  look at what's happened in the last few days. Putin is now talking about nuclear weapons for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=481.04s)]
*  the first time. I mean, he's talking about them all the time because Ukraine is now talking about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=485.6s)]
*  hitting Russia. And Biden doesn't know what the hell to say. But all of these things, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  they're going to end up leading to World War Three. I'll get the Ukrainian situation settled and I'll [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  get it settled fast. It would have never happened. The other thing that would have never happened is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=501.92s)]
*  the October 7th attack of Israel. It would have never happened. And you know what else? I'll add [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=507.36s)]
*  something else that wouldn't have happened. Inflation. We have the worst inflation maybe [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=512.4s)]
*  in the history of our country. Far worse than they report. Because when you add interest rates [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=516.96s)]
*  and when you add energy prices, look at the energy. By the way, gasoline prices are going [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=521.92s)]
*  way up again. When you add all of this in, I think it's the worst inflation we've ever had. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=527.28s)]
*  And our country has become shown a failing nation. You say declining nation. I say declining or [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=533.76s)]
*  failing. So let me go back to the foreign policy. I say a lot of things about it, but whatever I say [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=541.12s)]
*  about it, it's real bad. I want to talk more about that. But let me stay focused for just a second, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=545.92s)]
*  if I may, on the issue of we have war in Europe, we have war in the Middle East. And [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=549.52s)]
*  we have the Iranians, according to reports, even the IAEA, may be very close to nuclear weapons. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=556.4s)]
*  That should scare everybody because they're crazy enough that I think they would use them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=565.76s)]
*  And precarious situation. More dangerous, I think, than at any point. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  Most dangerous time in the history of our country. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=575.68s)]
*  I would agree. And so my question to you is, if you are elected and you are the next president, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=577.52s)]
*  the 47th president, how do you begin the process of restoring world order? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=584.56s)]
*  Now, one other thing. I never thought in my lifetime I would listen to a president of our [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=590.64s)]
*  country, the leader of the free world, literally tell a country that was attacked by radical Islamic [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=596.64s)]
*  terrorists that, oh, we'll support your defense, but we won't support you fighting back after [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=603.52s)]
*  the Iranians fired weapons into their country. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=610.64s)]
*  To me, that was a surrender in the war on terror or trying to lecture Israel, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=615.52s)]
*  oh, you can't go to Ra'afah, you can't do this. Okay, excuse me. How would we act if we lost what [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  would be, by population, extrapolated out 40,000 Americans in a day? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313M7UvNTnM&t=625.5999999999999s)]
