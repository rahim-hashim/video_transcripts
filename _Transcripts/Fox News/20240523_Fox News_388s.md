*  Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=42.84s)]
*  Why'd you come? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=43.84s)]
*  No freedom. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=44.84s)]
*  No freedom? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=45.84s)]
*  Yes, in Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=46.84s)]
*  Iran is a dangerous country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=47.84s)]
*  No freedom for speak, for writing, for singing, for thinking. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=48.84s)]
*  Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, India, China, and that's just one group in the middle of the night. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=54.84s)]
*  Plenty more have come from other countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Jordan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=60.84s)]
*  In fact, recently two men from Jordan were apprehended trying to illegally access the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=65.84s)]
*  Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=70.84s)]
*  Now, very little information about that incident has been released. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=73.84s)]
*  But Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member, Senator Lindsey Graham, is now demanding answers [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=78.84s)]
*  in a new letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=82.84s)]
*  And Senator Graham joins us now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=87.84s)]
*  Senator, it is curious. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=89.84s)]
*  I've been following this story for a couple days. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=90.84s)]
*  How little we know about these individuals. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=92.84s)]
*  We could presumably learn a lot quickly and they could release it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=94.84s)]
*  Have you heard back on the letter? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=98.84s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=100.84s)]
*  Haven't heard a word, but I'll make sure that I get an answer because, look, you got [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=101.84s)]
*  two fighting age males, came here illegally from the Mideast. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=105.84s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=109.84s)]
*  They're trying to lie their way and falsify their way into a Marine base. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=111.84s)]
*  If that doesn't bother you, what would? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=116.84s)]
*  For two years now, we've been screaming to high heaven, the border is broken, ISIS and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=118.84s)]
*  Al Qaeda are getting stronger over there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=123.84s)]
*  They're going to come here and kill a bunch of us if we don't do something new and different. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=125.84s)]
*  For two years, they continue the same old policies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=130.84s)]
*  I want to know, were these two guys on the terrorist watch list? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=133.84s)]
*  What do we know about them? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=136.84s)]
*  Why did they want to get on a Marine Corps base pretending to be something they're not? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=137.84s)]
*  They persisted from what I understand. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=142.84s)]
*  They pretended to be Amazon subcontractors, which they weren't. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=145.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=148.84s)]
*  They tried time and time again to get through. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=149.84s)]
*  So this letter, you're asking for their alien files, how they came, are they on the terror [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=151.84s)]
*  watch list? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=155.84s)]
*  How easy are those for someone like the Secretary of Homeland Security to obtain? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=156.84s)]
*  And what is his track record for actually giving you information about things he'd [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=161.84s)]
*  may or may not want to share? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=166.84s)]
*  Like pulling teeth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=168.84s)]
*  It took me months to find out that the man charged with killing Lakin Riley, Mr. Ebram, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=170.84s)]
*  I think is his name, came here illegally, paroled into the country because there was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=176.84s)]
*  no space in El Paso to detain him, not because he had a legitimate reason to be paroled. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=181.84s)]
*  They just had no place to put him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=187.84s)]
*  They let him go and he's charged with killing this young lady in Georgia. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=190.84s)]
*  We have two people trying to get onto a Marine base from the Mideast, fighting age males, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=194.84s)]
*  here illegally, and I am going to get to the bottom of it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=200.84s)]
*  There's a reason they're not telling us this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=204.84s)]
*  It took me forever to find out that the reason the guy who's accused of killing Ms. Riley [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=206.84s)]
*  came here illegally and paroled illegally, they didn't want to tell me that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=212.84s)]
*  I had to beat the crap out of them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=217.84s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=219.84s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=221.84s)]
*  If they knew there was nothing to it and they'd come running to the cameras and say, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=222.84s)]
*  well, this is just a big misunderstanding, absolutely they would. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=225.84s)]
*  So all that tells you is there is something there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=229.84s)]
*  You know, this administration's all about politics and control and their ability to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=232.84s)]
*  perpetuate their power. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=236.84s)]
*  Wouldn't they recognize that this vulnerability eventually is going to come home to roost [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=238.84s)]
*  10, 11, 15 million illegals in this country from all around the globe? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=242.84s)]
*  Eventually something terrible is going to happen and it's going to be on them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=246.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=249.84s)]
*  That's a really good question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=250.84s)]
*  At what point does it become clear your policy's not working? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=251.84s)]
*  Look at what's going on in the mid-East. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=255.84s)]
*  You're going to have the prime minister in a moment. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Look at the world we live in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to arrest the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister for fighting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  back against Hamas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  They're putting the ICC, a rogue prosecutor, is drunk with power. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, the Biden administration needs to up their game when it comes to Israel, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  give them the weapons they need to win a war they can't afford to lose, secure our border. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=278.84s)]
*  At what point in time does it become clear your policies are failing and we're going [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=283.84s)]
*  to get attacked again? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=288.84s)]
*  We're living on borrowed time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=289.84s)]
*  If this is not a wake-up call, what would be? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=291.84s)]
*  I mean, Senator, if you told us on 9-12-01 that we would be letting in people from all [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=294.84s)]
*  over, I mean, where are we on threat levels today vis-à-vis 9-10? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=301.84s)]
*  On a scale of 1 to 10, 12. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=307.84s)]
*  I've never seen it so bad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=310.84s)]
*  No, meaning versus the day before 9-11. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=311.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no, this is— [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=313.84s)]
*  Versus the day before 9-11. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=314.84s)]
*  So, here's what I would say. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=315.84s)]
*  The FBI director said that the lights are blinking everywhere. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=317.84s)]
*  He's seen threats before, but not so many at the same time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=321.84s)]
*  I've never seen more threats to our country than right now that could result in another [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=325.84s)]
*  9-11, and we're not adjusting our policies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=332.84s)]
*  The FBI director told the world, the nation, that everywhere he looks, he sees blinking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=335.84s)]
*  lights, and the Biden administration hasn't changed anything at the border. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=340.84s)]
*  It's just as broke as it was before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=345.84s)]
*  And Israel's under siege by Hamas, Hezbollah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=347.84s)]
*  Iran wants to kill all the Jews. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=350.84s)]
*  And our answer to the Hamas attack is to cut off weapons. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=352.84s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=358.84s)]
*  Hold them back. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=359.84s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=360.84s)]
*  Hold them back. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=361.84s)]
*  It's almost like the threat is on the side of the border. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDLwVwWLm4&t=362.84s)]
