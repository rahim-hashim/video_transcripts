# Sean Hannity: This is chilling
**Fox News:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM)
*  We begin tonight with this, more chaos out of New York, with the state's attorney general, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=0.0s)]
*  Letitia James, just set a dangerous new precedent in order to fill her political campaign promise, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=5.38s)]
*  which is to go after one organization, the Trump Organization, one man, Donald Trump, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=11.9s)]
*  one family, the Trump family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=16.34s)]
*  The New York attorney general cooked up a bizarre civil case, got a far-left New York [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=18.18s)]
*  leftist judge to rule in her favor, is now threatening to seize Donald Trump's businesses [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=23.78s)]
*  and properties if he doesn't come up with what is an unprecedented half a billion dollar [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=29.82s)]
*  bond, 30 bond companies, they don't do that kind of business. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=34.76s)]
*  Now this is a case straight out of the old Soviet Union, no victims here, the banks that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=39.5s)]
*  New York claims were defrauded, none of them complained, they all made money, paid on time [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=45.58s)]
*  with interest, they were eager to do business with Donald Trump again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=51.46s)]
*  Now keep in mind, financial institutions, they have their own fiduciary responsibility [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=56.0s)]
*  to do their own valuations, you don't loan hundreds of millions of dollars for a real [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=60.78s)]
*  estate project or insure hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate, unless you do your [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=66.36s)]
*  own due diligence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=72.44s)]
*  The Trump Organization even had a written disclaimer given to every bank and every insurance [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=74.28s)]
*  company, do not use the Trump Organization's valuations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=79.8s)]
*  That was confirmed by the Deutsche Bank witness that came up in this case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=84.76s)]
*  But a left-wing judge arbitrarily decided, Mar-a-Lago, this case was all about valuations, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=89.68s)]
*  he said a mere 18 million dollars, a fraction of the price of empty lots, two acre lots [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=95.54s)]
*  selling for one and two hundred million dollars, this is a 22 acre historic property with two [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=103.06s)]
*  clubs on the ocean, on the intercoastal, and it's in pristine condition, it's got 50 some [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=110.92s)]
*  odd bedrooms, it's got 40 some odd bathrooms, but you can get a two acre empty lot on the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=118.58s)]
*  ocean now for sale in Palm Beach for 200 million. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=124.44s)]
*  Does that sound like the right valuation? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=128.4s)]
*  Sounds like the judge in this case is more guilty than that which Donald Trump was ever [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=131.0s)]
*  accused of. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=135.32s)]
*  The New York Attorney General is chomping at the bit to seize these properties. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=136.56s)]
*  One problem however, the former president, he appears to have the cash to cover the bond [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=140.52s)]
*  on Truth Social. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=144.96s)]
*  Trump posted, quote, through hard work, talent and luck, I currently have almost 500 million [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  dollars in cash, a substantial amount which I intended to use for my campaign for president. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=152.52s)]
*  And speaking of Truth Social, Trump also stands to gain over three billion dollars when his [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=159.24s)]
*  social media company goes public, which by the way that approval happened today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  But let's be clear, this is not justice in America, this is political persecution. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  And you know, maybe many on the left and in the media mob you're celebrating, but remember [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  this, if this can happen to Donald Trump, it can happen to anyone in New York or any [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  other state that doesn't believe in equal justice or application of our laws, and they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=186.86s)]
*  deem individual A, B or C a political problem. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=192.34s)]
*  It is chilling, but it's not just New York. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  Multiple states and the U.S. federal government have weaponized justice in order to silence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  their political rivals, all to get Donald Trump, get Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=204.18s)]
*  In a bombshell new interview with the Daily Mail, while Trump's acting secretary of defense, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=208.8s)]
*  Chris Miller, he accused the January 6th committee of waging a campaign of intimidation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=213.86s)]
*  The January 6th committee threatened to make his life hell if he kept claiming that his [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=220.34s)]
*  former boss authorized National Guard deployment before the riot. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=226.1s)]
*  So Miller claims that members intimidated him, warned that they would repeatedly bring [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=232.1s)]
*  him in for hours of additional testimony if he kept going on TV and defending the former [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=237.1s)]
*  president's actions. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  The piece is specifically referring to this show. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=244.62s)]
*  According to Miller, Liz Cheney was running the show, and apparently his claim that Trump [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=247.98s)]
*  called up the, was willing to call up the National Guard in the days leading up to January [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=253.06s)]
*  6th to protect the Capitol, well, that was ruining their predetermined outcome, her narrative, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=258.3s)]
*  a narrative that was, we now know, full of, well, outright lies. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=264.18s)]
*  And despite Cheney's dishonest and self-aggrandizing smear campaign, well, the defense secretary, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=269.5s)]
*  says that Trump, in fact, did ask for sufficient National Guard protection at the Capitol in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=275.34s)]
*  the days leading up to January 6th. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  So did the Capitol police chief, son. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=284.74s)]
*  So did the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=287.34s)]
*  So did the DOD inspector general. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  In their report, it said, quote, General Milley told us that at the end of the meeting, the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=294.5s)]
*  president told Mr. Miller that there would be a large number of protesters on January [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=298.98s)]
*  6th, and Mr. Miller should ensure sufficient National Guard or soldiers would be there [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=303.86s)]
*  to make sure it was a safe event. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=309.3s)]
*  Remember, in writing, D.C. Mayor Bowser was reported that she declined any National Guard [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  help. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=318.62s)]
*  But it wasn't just Milley and Miller making the claims. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=319.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  Calling up the guard, and then it became, the chain of command went to Nancy Pelosi [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=325.14000000000004s)]
*  and to the mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=330.96s)]
*  Did you, as required by law, authorize that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=334.0s)]
*  One hundred percent, and attested to by many people, and they turned it down. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=337.52s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi turned it down. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=345.0s)]
*  Mayor Bowser's written refusal, the communications between the leader of the Capitol police and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=347.28s)]
*  their chain of command to the DOD refusing our request to allow National Guardsmen and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=353.12s)]
*  women to stage on January 4th and 5th before January 6th. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=358.64s)]
*  Did you both ask for the National Guard to be called up? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=362.36s)]
*  Without a doubt, Sean, we've made that very clear, not just once, but on numerous occasions. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=367.84s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that there was plenty of National Guard on the ready in case there [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=373.52s)]
*  was some kind of violence. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=378.96s)]
*  I can only speak about the 6th of January and the events leading up to it, and I can [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=380.44s)]
*  President Trump offered any and all support requested by suitable officials within Washington, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=385.32s)]
*  D.C., federal, state, well, not state, but federal and local. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=391.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=396.48s)]
*  Now, the president wanted the Capitol protected. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=397.48s)]
*  The January 6th committee, well, they weren't telling the whole truth. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=399.8s)]
*  They didn't want that part of the story getting out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=403.96s)]
*  Why didn't they bring in the Capitol police chief? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=406.08s)]
*  It was never a serious committee conducting a real investigation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=408.68s)]
*  The worst part is, is they haven't come up with a plan to prevent this from ever happening [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=411.78s)]
*  again. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=416.02s)]
*  This was a political witch hunt. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=417.05999999999995s)]
*  This was a smear campaign, a vessel for Liz Cheney's petty revenge. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=418.85999999999996s)]
*  Now, tonight, we're just 227 days away from the election. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=422.9s)]
*  And while Trump's opponents are banking on a variety of political witch hunts to put [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=427.7s)]
*  them over the top, Biden, he's just struggling away in the polls. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=432.05999999999995s)]
*  New CNN survey has Biden down by a whopping eight points of Michigan, well beyond the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=436.14s)]
*  margin of error. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=441.26s)]
*  The same polls shows Donald Trump up by two in a very important state of Pennsylvania. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=442.26s)]
*  But today, Biden's sidekick, Kamala Harris, she was campaigning in Puerto Rico, a U.S. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=448.14s)]
*  territory without any electoral votes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=453.3s)]
*  Earlier in the week, she compared the Biden administration to a CVS receipt. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=461.14s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=462.14s)]
*  We have achieved a lot. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  Carol was so wonderful in her introduction to list what could be, you know, my husband [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  Doug says it's like a CVS receipt. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=471.22s)]
*  You know, we could just go on and on with what we've got on the list. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=473.3s)]
*  But I will say what everyone here knows. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=478.5s)]
*  I do believe strongly that this is a very decisive decade that we're in. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  And the moment is now. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=490.38000000000005s)]
*  So according to Democrats, your life is so much better under Biden, you just don't realize [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=493.54s)]
*  it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  You're not smart enough to figure it out. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quILYHLqzDM&t=499.90000000000003s)]
