# WATCH: Trump answers audience questions at Fox News town hall
**Fox News:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo)
*  Thank you for staying to take questions from the audience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I always will plan out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=4.44s)]
*  I do all this research to ask you questions and you just go. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=6.92s)]
*  But we came here also to hear from the people of Harrisburg. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=11.28s)]
*  Before we get to the people I want to again introduce, we introduced them last night on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  the show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Dave McCormick is the Republican Senate candidate from Pennsylvania. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Senator, great to have you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=23.88s)]
*  I'll give you a chance to say a couple of words. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=27.76s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, thank you, Sean, and thank you for Mr. President for being here in the Keystone State. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  And the Keystone State is going to decide the future of the country, put you back in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=34.88s)]
*  the White House and the majority in the Senate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=38.44s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=41.24s)]
*  Thank you, David. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=42.24s)]
*  And you know, Mr. President, it's a scary time in the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=43.24s)]
*  Our adversaries around the world, Iran, China, Russia, North Korea, are testing us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=46.72s)]
*  They're challenging us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=53.96s)]
*  We've lost deterrence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=54.96s)]
*  They think America's weak. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=55.96s)]
*  They think America's on retreat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=57.36s)]
*  And my question to you is on day one when you're back in the White House, how do we [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=59.28s)]
*  restore deterrence? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=63.56s)]
*  How do we bring strength and capability back to our military? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=65.68s)]
*  And how do we make sure that everybody in the world knows that America is back? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=69.12s)]
*  So thank you, David, and good luck with the race. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=74.52s)]
*  It's really important that you win. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=76.8s)]
*  I hope you're going to vote. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=77.8s)]
*  He's a great gentleman and a great — he's a great warrior. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=78.8s)]
*  The first thing we have to do, we have to strengthen our country from within. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=85.12s)]
*  And we have a lot of bad people from within, but we have to straighten it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=89.36s)]
*  We have to, number one, have a border like we had it four years ago, which was strong, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=92.28s)]
*  where the wrong people didn't get in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=98.36s)]
*  We have to have that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=101.84s)]
*  The other thing we want to become, again, energy independent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  We were energy independent four years ago. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  And what we really want is energy dominance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=110.28s)]
*  And then, as you know, I rebuilt the entire military, and we had it like nobody has ever [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=113.24s)]
*  had it before. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  And then this guy gave away $85 billion worth of equipment to Afghanistan in the most embarrassing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  moment in the history of our country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=128.64s)]
*  But we have a lot more than that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  We rebuilt the military. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=132.88s)]
*  We want to be strong, but we want to do it peace through strength. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=138.72s)]
*  Peace through strength. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=139.72s)]
*  We shouldn't have to use our military. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=141.2s)]
*  We're going to have the greatest military in the world. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=144.2s)]
*  Thank you, David. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=146.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=147.96s)]
*  Ma'am, hi. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=148.96s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=149.96s)]
*  My name is Deborah Williams. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=150.96s)]
*  Hi, Deborah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=152.96s)]
*  How are you? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=153.96s)]
*  I'm good now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=154.96s)]
*  Hi, Deborah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=155.96s)]
*  Oh, because of me or because of the president? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=156.96s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=159.6s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=160.6s)]
*  I plead the fifth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=161.6s)]
*  Good answer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=162.6s)]
*  Mr. President, I want to thank you for coming and sharing your time with us today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=163.6s)]
*  Thank you, Deborah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  What could you share that you've learned during the first time being in the Oval Office [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  for those who are hesitant to vote for you now? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=177.8s)]
*  So we need a strong president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know, I actually think we had a very stable administration, but we were hit with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  this weaponization. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  We were hit to weaponize. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=195.44s)]
*  They've never done this before. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=196.44s)]
*  The weaponization, all of the different Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, all of the different [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=198.48s)]
*  hoaxes, and we won every single one of them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=203.32s)]
*  The most important thing, and I found it, and you could say this is true in business [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=207.32s)]
*  also, we have to get the right people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=212.72s)]
*  When I first went there, 2016, we were, I had a lot of good people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  I had a lot of good advice, but I put people in that in some cases were not what I really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=220.48s)]
*  wanted because I didn't know much about Washington. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  I was there 17 times in my whole life and I wasn't in D.C. very much, but I got to know [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  them and I got to know them the hard way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=234.04s)]
*  And I know the good ones, the bad ones, the weak ones, the smart ones, the dumb ones. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  I know them all now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=241.76s)]
*  And the key, and we had great ones. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, economic development, we did so well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=247.0s)]
*  The military, we did fantastically well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=249.2s)]
*  We knocked out ISIS, 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=251.56s)]
*  We have some great people in the military, not the ones that you see on television, but [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=255.04s)]
*  great people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=259.36s)]
*  But a big key to running it is get the right people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=260.36s)]
*  You put the right person and the right group of people at the heads of these massive agencies, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=264.84s)]
*  you're going to have tremendous success. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=270.68s)]
*  And I know now the people and I know them better than anybody would know them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=272.56s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=275.92s)]
*  Thank you, Deborah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=276.92s)]
*  Ma'am, hi. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=277.92s)]
*  Ma'am, what's your name? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=278.92s)]
*  Sue Helm. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=279.92s)]
*  Hey Sue. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=280.92s)]
*  Sue Helm. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=282.32s)]
*  Hey Sue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=283.32s)]
*  And I'd like to welcome you to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=284.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=285.32s)]
*  We love you both. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=286.32s)]
*  So, wonderful. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=287.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=288.32s)]
*  I'm a small business owner. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=289.32s)]
*  I'm the owner of Century 21 at the Helm Real Estate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=291.2s)]
*  The four years of your presidency, Mr. Trump, were the best economically I have experienced [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  in the 35 years I own this business. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=300.64s)]
*  And my question is, what are your plans and policies to restore the economy so small business [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=304.68s)]
*  owners can thrive and make America great once again? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Good. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=318.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=319.6s)]
*  Good. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=320.6s)]
*  You know, we had a woman who was very spectacular, Linda McMahon, and she ran the Small Business [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=321.6s)]
*  Administration, did a phenomenal job. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=328.48s)]
*  And that's a very important group for what we're talking about with small business. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  But to put it a little simpler, we're going to have low interest rates, we're going to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=335.2s)]
*  have low taxes, we're going to give you tremendous incentive to grow and to build your business. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  And you know, a lot of people have said that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=345.36s)]
*  They said, one person who didn't support me, he said, I must admit, I had the most successful [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=347.2s)]
*  four years of my life, but I'm going to vote for some. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=353.64s)]
*  I said, and now that person came back to me. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=356.52s)]
*  I don't want that person. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=360.04s)]
*  I don't want that person. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=361.4s)]
*  You know, they say you should take everybody, but that's not the way I'm built. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=362.4s)]
*  It's one of those little problems. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=366.48s)]
*  This person, no, this was in the Republican primary, said, I had the best four years I've [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=368.28s)]
*  ever had under Trump, but I'm going to support this one. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=372.24s)]
*  I said, that's the end of that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=375.0s)]
*  You know, when they came back. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=376.4s)]
*  But we're going to lower interest rates, we're going to have low taxes, we're going to have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=378.12s)]
*  tremendous incentives for small business. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=381.28s)]
*  You know, small business is much bigger than big business in this country when you add [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=383.84s)]
*  it all up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=387.8s)]
*  And we're going to take care of small business in this country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=388.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=391.8s)]
*  Thank you, ma'am. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=392.8s)]
*  Sir, what's your name? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=393.8s)]
*  Travis Finkenbinder. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=396.52s)]
*  I'm from Palmyra, Pennsylvania. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=397.52s)]
*  Like to welcome you both here, and it's an honor to stand before you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=400.32s)]

*  Mr. President, is it possible to correct the extensive damage the current administration [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  has caused related to our safety and security? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=409.96s)]
*  From the border crisis to the plethora of weapons left behind in Afghanistan, I fear [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=412.96s)]
*  for my three adolescent sons. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=417.52s)]
*  At night, what do I tell Cale, Cade, and Cole about their safety and their future of this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  great nation? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=425.0s)]
*  Well, the first thing you should do is pray. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=426.0s)]
*  Amen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=428.0s)]
*  Because what they've done to our country, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=429.0s)]
*  What they've done to our country, what these, what these, and I hate to use the word, what [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=432.0s)]
*  these stupid people, naive people, but bad people. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=439.0s)]
*  You know, weaponization. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=443.28s)]
*  Again, they're after me. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=444.28s)]
*  I got more court cases. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=445.32s)]
*  On Friday I have one, on Monday I have one, and they do that for very bad reasons. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=447.04s)]
*  They don't want you to campaign. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=451.88s)]
*  They want to keep you off the campaign. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=453.72s)]
*  They want to try and take as much money as possible instead of putting in it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=455.0s)]
*  But let me just tell you, the hardest problem we have, because a smart president would be [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=458.28s)]
*  able to get along with Russia, China. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=463.46s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons why. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=465.16s)]
*  The biggest problem we have is they've allowed 21 million people into our country. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=467.67999999999995s)]
*  And this, and I told you last night, I tell you tonight, it's the single biggest problem. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=472.52s)]
*  They've poisoned our country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=478.67999999999995s)]
*  They're coming in from prisons. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  They're coming in from mental institutions. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=482.64s)]
*  Terrorists are coming in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=485.88s)]
*  The criminals are coming off the streets in Caracas, Venezuela, but all over the world, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  not just in South America. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=492.76s)]
*  It's the single hardest problem that we would have never had. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=494.84s)]
*  If I were president, you wouldn't have that problem. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=499.4s)]
*  You wouldn't have inflation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=501.67999999999995s)]
*  You wouldn't have Russia attacking Ukraine. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  You wouldn't have had October 7th with Israel. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=506.44s)]
*  You wouldn't have had the Afghanistan disaster, which I think is the most single most embarrassing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=509.64s)]
*  day in the history of our country, where they have billions of dollars of equipment. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=515.3s)]
*  We lost 13 great, great soldiers, and I celebrated and honored their wonderful — they call [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=521.62s)]
*  them their children, and they are their children. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=528.9s)]
*  They're wonderful children. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=531.54s)]
*  They're kids. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=533.7s)]
*  I went to Arlington Cemetery with them the other day, and at their request — at their [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=534.74s)]
*  request — and Sean knows this better than anybody — and it was very tough for me to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=542.34s)]
*  get there, I will tell you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=546.82s)]
*  I don't want to say that, but it was very tough. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=547.82s)]
*  I was in a different part of the world, frankly, and I got there, and we had a beautiful couple [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=549.7s)]
*  of hours together. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=555.26s)]
*  First, we had a ceremony, and then we had a — we went down to the gravesites, and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=556.26s)]
*  they said, sir, could we have a picture with my son? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=562.7s)]
*  In one case, it was a daughter. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=566.88s)]
*  Could we have a picture with my daughter? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  We took pictures. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=570.1400000000001s)]
*  We had — stayed for a long time, and then I left, and that was it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=571.1400000000001s)]
*  I thought it was beautiful, and those people are phenomenal. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=575.32s)]
*  They've done — Joe Biden and Kamala killed those children because of their incompetence, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=578.24s)]
*  just like they had — just like they had a gun that killed them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=585.92s)]
*  And I went home, and I thought it was a beautiful thing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=591.28s)]
*  I told my wife — I told a great First Lady who people love. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  They love her. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  But I said it was so sad and yet so beautiful and joyful in a sense. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the people — they had something that was very special. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=607.52s)]
*  And I went there, and, you know, I had them up to bed. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=611.04s)]
*  Minster, I got to know many of them, most of them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=613.64s)]
*  But I get home, and I get a call from one of my people, sir. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=616.92s)]
*  They're saying that you use this for public relations purposes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=620.96s)]
*  And you know what happened? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=625.68s)]
*  It was so beautiful. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=626.68s)]
*  Every one of those people made a video to say that Donald Trump came there. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  I got enough publicity. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't need publicity. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=636.36s)]
*  I'd like to get half the publicity. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=637.36s)]
*  I'd be very happy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  But they said that — and you saw the videos. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=641.36s)]
*  The videos became very, very well-known and famous, actually. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=644.6s)]
*  Some beautiful statements. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=649.12s)]
*  And I went there. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=650.12s)]
*  I got nothing out of that except to take care of people that were not taken care of by our [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  And Joe Biden and Kamala should call those people and apologize because that was the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=656.9200000000001s)]
*  most incompetent withdrawal in the history of our country. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=664.64s)]
*  There's never been anything so — think of it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=669.0s)]
*  We took the military out first. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=671.96s)]
*  You're supposed to take the military out last. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=673.32s)]
*  Once the military was gone, they had free shots at us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  But we took the military out first, and then it began. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  We lost 13 soldiers. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=682.28s)]
*  Many were horribly wounded, meaning no legs, no arms. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=684.16s)]
*  The face was obliterated. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=688.64s)]
*  Many — we don't even talk about those people, and we have to. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  We left Americans behind — and you cover that better than anybody — we left many [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=694.12s)]
*  Americans behind, and we left billions and billions of dollars of brand-new military [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=698.64s)]
*  equipment behind that now they are one of the largest sellers of military equipment [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=705.32s)]
*  in the world. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=710.76s)]
*  Afghanistan — they're selling the equipment that we just walked away from. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=711.76s)]
*  It was so incompetent. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=716.24s)]
*  But to be with those people was a real honor, I have to tell you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=718.52s)]
*  And for them to go out of their way — and every one of them made a video — they said, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=723.2s)]
*  sir, could you take a picture next to the grave of my son? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=729.12s)]
*  I said, of course. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=733.84s)]
*  Could you imagine if I said, no, I don't want to do it? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=734.84s)]
*  I don't want to do it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  But every one of those people appreciated it, and every one of them made a tape, and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=739.26s)]
*  they sent it out, and it became very viral, as they say nowadays. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=743.36s)]
*  And it was a great honor for me to be there. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=747.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=749.2s)]
*  And I should add, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were both invited. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  And this was not — you knew these families. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=757.08s)]
*  You had met with them at Bedminster. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=759.08s)]
*  You were familiar with them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=760.08s)]
*  Yes, I knew them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=761.08s)]
*  And they invited you, you went, and they said, would you take a picture? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=762.08s)]
*  And then you did, and then you were attacked, and then the families were furious at Kamala [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=766.0400000000001s)]
*  about it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  I think this is going to be the last question. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  What's your name, sir? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=774.4000000000001s)]
*  Hi, Alastair Hackett from Spring Lake, New Jersey. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=775.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Alex. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=778.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=779.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=780.48s)]
*  I'm a recent college graduate and am concerned with the growing influence of wokeness in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=781.48s)]
*  many of our top institutions. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=785.64s)]
*  We saw General Milley take this to new heights under his leadership in the military. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=787.76s)]
*  What is your plan to combat radical ideology in the military and in our corporations? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=792.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, Milley — [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=797.24s)]
*  — that day in Congress where Milley proclaimed his will — [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=799.28s)]
*  — and I got to meet the real generals, and they are unbelievable. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=808.96s)]
*  Our military is unbelievable. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=835.84s)]
*  Remember it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=838.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=839.72s)]
*  There's no wokeness. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=840.72s)]
*  There's no wokeness. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=842.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=844.72s)]
*  And all we're going to do is you go out, you get your degree, you work hard, you're going [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=845.72s)]
*  to see a different country. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=851.32s)]
*  We have to get elected. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=852.64s)]
*  If we don't get elected, I don't know what's going to happen to our country. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=853.64s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=856.6s)]
*  They're so bad. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=857.6s)]
*  And normally I wouldn't say that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=859.2s)]
*  I'd say, well, they're working. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=860.4s)]
*  They're a Democrat. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=862.12s)]
*  These aren't Democrats. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=863.12s)]
*  These are people long beyond Democrats. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=864.44s)]
*  When I used to say to Sean on his show, I'd say, our country, Sean, will never be a socialist [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=867.0s)]
*  country. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=871.88s)]
*  And it won't. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=872.88s)]
*  It'll be a communist country. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=873.88s)]
*  They skipped socialism. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=874.88s)]
*  They totally — we cannot let this happen to our country because if it does happen, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=876.6s)]
*  we'll never be able to come back. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=881.6s)]
*  We'll never be able to make a comeback from it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=883.1600000000001s)]
*  So we're going to have a big election. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a very — Pennsylvania, a very important — the Commonwealth. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=887.6s)]
*  And you never want to call it a state. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=890.96s)]
*  The Commonwealth. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=893.2s)]
*  If you ever call it a state — [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=894.2s)]
*  I've seen guys — I've seen their political career ruined by saying the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  No, you never want to call it a state. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=903.36s)]
*  Now, I'll tell you how dishonest they are. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  They'll take that one little statement where I said the state of Pennsylvania, and they'll [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  play it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=912.36s)]
*  The state of Pennsylvania. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=913.36s)]
*  They'll cut it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=914.36s)]
*  You never want to — [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=915.36s)]
*  Well, there's one other thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=916.36s)]
*  Let me just — because they're fake. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=917.36s)]
*  And one thing we should say — not him and not Fox. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  We have a couple of others out there that are good, but the biggest — a great enemy [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=923.72s)]
*  to this country is the fake news media. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=929.08s)]
*  It's a big, big enemy. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=931.8s)]
*  And they have to change their ways. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=933.8s)]
*  They have to change their ways. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=936.8s)]
*  Before we let the president go — because this is airing part two on Thursday night, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=938.4s)]
*  I want to ask you one final question. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=944.08s)]
*  In five nights, you'll be on the stage not with me, but with Kamala Harris. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=947.0s)]
*  Now, if I'm going to make a prediction, I think she's going to try and annoy, agitate, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  irritate, frustrate, and piss you off, to use a phrase. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=960.48s)]
*  And are you aware of how she debates and probably every name in the — every name in the book [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=965.24s)]
*  she can call you and — without giving away your tactic? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=974.84s)]
*  Yeah, I — you don't want to do that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=978.36s)]
*  But you know, when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  And I let him talk. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=984.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to let her talk because, you know — [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  You've all seen it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=988.64s)]
*  There are those that say that Biden is smarter than she is, okay? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=994.68s)]
*  And if that's the case, we have a problem. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  But you know, debating is an interesting thing. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1002.92s)]
*  I've been in many debates. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1005.56s)]
*  I think I probably won because of debating, maybe. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1006.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, we had a lot of debates with the Republicans. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1010.3599999999999s)]
*  Then we had Crooked Hillary. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1012.4s)]
*  We had a lot of different people. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1013.52s)]
*  We had a debate. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1014.7199999999999s)]
*  And we had some great debates. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  You do remember the Rosie O'Donnell debate. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1017.2399999999999s)]
*  Remember Rosie? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1019.52s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1020.8399999999999s)]
*  That's a real — she's a real great one. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1022.4s)]
*  Isn't she a great one? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1025.24s)]
*  Anyway, but a debate is interesting. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1027.24s)]
*  You really — you can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to sort of feel it out [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1031.24s)]
*  as the debates take place. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  You go in there and you have a strategy. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  Mike Tyson made the statement, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1039.48s)]
*  It's true. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1044.24s)]
*  It was a brilliant statement. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1045.24s)]
*  It's a brilliant statement. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1048.04s)]
*  So I could tell Sean exactly what I'm going to do. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1049.48s)]
*  But you know, things change. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1051.72s)]
*  It depends a lot on ABC. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  Will they be fair or not? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  If they're not going to be fair, I'm going to be a little bit different than if they [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1057.52s)]
*  are. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1061.1599999999999s)]
*  I hope they're going to be fair. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1062.1599999999999s)]
*  They're putting a lot of reliance on a network which is known for being extremely hostile [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1064.04s)]
*  to the people in this room and to, I think, 75, 80 percent of the country, if you want [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  to really know the truth. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1074.96s)]
*  But Sean, all I can say is this. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1076.6s)]
*  You know, I've seen Mitt Romney go and lock himself into a log cabin for four or five [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1078.96s)]
*  weeks and then he came out and he was horrible in the debate. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  He couldn't talk. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1086.24s)]
*  He gained great knowledge. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1087.84s)]
*  He couldn't talk. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1089.08s)]
*  And Candy Crowley came out and she made a terrible statement that turned out to be wrong, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1090.4s)]
*  but it destroyed the guy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1094.96s)]
*  But look, you have to — the way I look at debating, I think I've been really practicing [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1096.24s)]
*  all my life for this stuff. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1101.72s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, that's what it's sort of about. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1103.0s)]
*  So it'll be an interesting — it'll be an interesting evening. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  And the Biden debate was a very interesting evening. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1112.2800000000002s)]
*  I was sort of surprised by it a little bit, by, you know, what he did and the way he reacted. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1114.48s)]
*  And you don't know how somebody's going to react. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  Even a professional, you don't know how they're going to react. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1122.6s)]
*  And you have to sort of go with it as you get up there, Sean. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1125.52s)]
*  I'd love to give you an answer. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1127.7199999999998s)]
*  This is what I'm going to do, Sean. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1128.84s)]
*  But when you get up there, you sort of — because I've done a lot of it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1130.52s)]
*  I went from never having debated to having done a lot of debates. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  But you know she's going to try and annoy you, but that's not going to happen. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1138.36s)]
*  Well, I think we have a bigger problem. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1141.4399999999998s)]
*  I think that ABC will try and annoy him. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1143.36s)]
*  I bet that too. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1145.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1146.24s)]
*  President Donald Trump, thank you, Harrisburg. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAqEHBVpgNo&t=1147.24s)]
