*  You ask me or you ask AI, draw me a Siberian farmer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=27.84s)]
*  I think that's what they come up with. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=33.44s)]
*  He looks like one, doesn't he? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=36.88s)]
*  He does. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=38.32s)]

*  Get ready. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=42.32s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=45.32s)]
*  They're not doing proper job. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=48.32s)]
*  One and done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=51.32s)]
*  He's out for the count. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=54.32s)]
*  I mean, this is the ultimate warrior sport behind the slap available only on FoxStation.com. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=55.8s)]
*  You got to watch it anyway here now with more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=60.88s)]
*  Our friend, UFC president Dana White. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=63.04s)]
*  I haven't talked to you since you introduced Trump at the RNC. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=65.88s)]
*  You know, you said something about him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=69.2s)]
*  You're in the tough guy business, and that's true. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=71.04s)]
*  And this man is the toughest, most resilient human being I've ever met in my life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=74.72s)]
*  You know, the higher the stakes, the harder the fights, the guy that never gives up. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=79.72s)]
*  How was that for you being at the RNC? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=84.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's absolutely true. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=87.48s)]
*  I mean, listen, I say it all the time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=90.48s)]
*  First of all, everybody should be disgusted if somebody takes a shot at a former or current [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=93.48s)]
*  president, no matter who it is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=98.48s)]
*  And as men, every man thinks there's some level of tough guy, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=101.48s)]
*  You don't find out who the real tough guys are until tough guy stuff happens. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=106.48s)]
*  They shot at him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=111.56s)]
*  His reaction to being shot at was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=112.56s)]
*  He's one of the most resilient, toughest human beings on the planet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=119.56s)]
*  And contrary to what the narrative is and what everybody would like you to believe, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=123.56s)]
*  he's one of the best guys you will ever meet. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=127.56s)]
*  Him and his entire family are nothing but classy, great people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=129.56s)]
*  I've known him for 30 years, Dana. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=133.56s)]
*  That guy that got up after getting shot, fight, fight, fight, and he's going up against a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=135.56s)]
*  candidate, you know, changing her positions daily. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like fake, fake, fake. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  He said everybody thinks they're a tough guy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  I sent you a demonstration to me and my sensei. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  I got like zero response from you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Like you could have said, not bad for, you know, an amateur. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  But I didn't, I got no feedback from you, which I was like disappointed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to hear from the great Dana White. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Let me, let me go to this whole issue of power swap. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you this real quick. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  In my life, I've known guys in Boston and other places where there's been attempts on guys lives, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=168.72s)]
*  right, that have been in bad situations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=175.72s)]
*  Everybody that I've known, once that happens to you, you change. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=178.72s)]
*  You know, you're never the same after something like that happens. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=182.72s)]
*  Not him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=186.72s)]
*  Not only not him, when I landed in Italy, I talked to him after he just got back from the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=187.72s)]
*  hospital. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=192.72s)]
*  And this guy is one of the unfazed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=193.72s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the toughest guys I've ever known. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=196.8s)]
*  And when you talk about real leadership for the country, and I said this in a speech too, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=198.8s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=204.8s)]
*  America needs a strong leader and the world needs a strong America. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=205.8s)]
*  And he's the guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=209.8s)]
*  He is the guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=210.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=211.8s)]
*  I'm a complete amateur. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=213.8s)]
*  I'm a student of mixed martial arts. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=214.8s)]
*  I do it for fitness more than anything else. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=216.8s)]
*  But, you know, I've got a sensei that can snap 15 people, you know, in at once. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=218.8s)]
*  You know, he's that tough. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  He's that strong. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  He has that many black belts. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  He's the real deal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  And I've learned a lot. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  I watch Power Slap. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  I find it entertaining. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  Now, you could use more of a palm strike and you probably can't see my face, but if you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  hit just below your ear, you know, and you break down the jaw, you should be able to, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  you know, knock the jaw off its hinge and it would go up to somebody's brain like we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  just, like we just aired. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is serious warrior stuff that's going on here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=251.96s)]
*  And, you know, these guys, if you can take one of those slaps, wow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=256.96s)]
*  The fact that you're willing to take it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=260.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=262.96s)]
*  Pretty impressive to me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=263.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=265.96s)]
*  And it's not the palm strike here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=266.96s)]
*  That's actually illegal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=267.96s)]
*  It's called clubbing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=268.96s)]
*  So on this one, you have to wind up and you hit flat with the fingers in the hand at the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=269.96s)]
*  same time, not the palm. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=275.96s)]
*  The palm is actually a follow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=276.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=279.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  So now you can do, for example, I can do an ear box on somebody. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  But the fact that you wind up and you can, I mean, we just saw the knockout. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=284.64s)]
*  I'll run it again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=289.44s)]
*  This is like the ultimate warrior sport. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=291.44s)]
*  So you've had all this success with the UFC. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=293.84s)]
*  I actually see this as maybe getting that big. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=297.32s)]
*  What do you see the potential as? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=302.76s)]
*  Remember I told you this here today, this will be bigger than the UFC. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=306.4s)]
*  I mean, we've only been doing this for like 18 months. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=309.8s)]
*  Listen, I'm going to rip off some of these numbers for you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=311.8s)]
*  I'm going to do it off the paper because I did a podcast recently where I was wrong on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=313.8s)]
*  a couple of things. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=317.88s)]
*  So in 18 months, we have 17 million followers. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=319.0s)]
*  We have 8 billion views on social in 18 months. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=323.32s)]
*  We have more Instagram followers than every major league baseball team, every NHL team [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=327.76s)]
*  and 30 of 32 NFL teams. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=333.44s)]
*  And the list goes on and on to where I could just crack off numbers for you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  We have nine videos with over a hundred million views on social and I can keep going on and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  This thing is an absolute juggernaut and it reminds me of the early days of the UFC, all [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  the negativity that surrounded it and people talking about it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  But this thing is an absolute juggernaut. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWzbu-b8H7I&t=353.88s)]
