# This is such a corrupt case: Alan Dershowitz
**Fox News:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4)
*  Maybe he'll die. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with reaction to all of our top stories tonight, Fox News legal analyst, bestselling [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=2.04s)]
*  author Greg Jarrett, and Harvard law professor, also bestselling author Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=6.32s)]
*  Professor, there's a lot of meat on that bone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=11.78s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on all of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=15.22s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was a clear reversible era today, committed by the judge and by the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=17.92s)]
*  prosecution under the reasoning of the recently reversed Harvey Weinstein case. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  So much information came out that was utterly irrelevant. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=29.16s)]
*  Let's start with whether they had sex at all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=32.72s)]
*  Utterly irrelevant. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=35.24s)]
*  The only issue is whether she threatened to expose him and whether she extorted him and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=36.24s)]
*  whether he then paid money to avoid the embarrassment to his family, to his business, to his children, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=42.2s)]
*  and according to the prosecution, to help himself get reelected. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  The issue of what actually happened is utterly irrelevant. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=53.6s)]
*  And then we get to the details, the silk pajamas, the kind of lotion he was wearing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=56.92s)]
*  I can't imagine how the court of appeals in New York that reversed the Harvey Weinstein [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=63.08s)]
*  conviction, which was a harder case to reverse, wouldn't reverse this conviction if it got [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=68.56s)]
*  up there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  I would certainly recommend to the prosecutors in this case that they study the Weinstein [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  case very carefully, because it gives a road map to what you can't do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=79.2s)]
*  This prosecutor is just following the road map of what you can't do. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  And now the judge says, well, he didn't object enough. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  In the court of appeals, they have a concept called chattering magpie. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=95.16s)]
*  The courts warn lawyers, don't object too much. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=100.24s)]
*  Object once and then just keep quiet. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Don't become a chattering magpie. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=106.16s)]
*  And this judge then says, well, well, they didn't object enough. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=108.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they objected before. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, they objected during. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=113.24s)]
*  Yeah, they objected after. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they sought a dismissal and a mistrial. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  That's not good enough for me, Judge Marshawn, because I'm going to convict this guy no matter [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  what and I'm certainly not going to give a mistrial, because if I get a mistrial, it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  may be tried before a different judge, and then my daughter won't make money off this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=130.88s)]
*  case. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=134.84s)]
*  This is such a corrupt case. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=135.84s)]
*  From beginning to end, it's corrupt. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=137.52s)]
*  Again, as somebody who doesn't care as much about politics, but who's devoted his life [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=140.84s)]
*  to the Constitution, this endangers everybody's rights and every liberal, every conservative, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  every Trump supporter, every Biden supporter should be appalled by this case and should [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=152.32s)]
*  be complaining about how our Constitution is being weaponized in the interest of partisan [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=157.92s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=163.64s)]
*  They won't care. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=164.64s)]
*  It's irrelevant, immaterial. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=165.64s)]
*  Greg Jarrett, get your take on today's events and the trial in general. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=167.76s)]
*  Well, Stormy Daniels was called to the witness stand for only one purpose, Sean, to slime [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=173.2s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=178.88s)]
*  But she's peddled so many conflicting stories. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  You get whiplash on cross-examination, though. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=183.92s)]
*  She withered. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  She was confronted with hard evidence that her motive was greed, hatred of Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, hopefully jurors saw her for what she is, a shakedown artist. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=194.24s)]
*  It's her livelihood. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=199.6s)]
*  And at one point, she unbelievably claimed, oh, I don't care about the money, only making [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=200.6s)]
*  my story public. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=207.0s)]
*  Well, if that's true, why did you agree to remain silent in exchange for big bags of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=208.48s)]
*  money? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=214.72s)]
*  She is so clueless. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=216.16s)]
*  She walked right into it today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=217.56s)]
*  And as witnesses go, I'd say she's self-destructed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=219.32s)]
*  But the professor is right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  None of what she had to say today was remotely relevant to any of the charges against Donald [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=230.0s)]
*  She had no knowledge. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=231.0s)]
*  Prosecutors put her on the stand to vilify Trump with a salacious story, irrelevant, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=232.28s)]
*  highly prejudicial, probative of nothing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=238.6s)]
*  And that is the legal standard that makes her testimony inadmissible. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=242.0s)]
*  And any fair judge would not have allowed it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=248.56s)]
*  Unfortunately for Donald Trump, he's stuck with Juan Marchand as the judge. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=252.6s)]
*  And this is the problem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=258.32s)]
*  It'll be all smoke and all mirrors. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=259.32s)]
*  And when the dust clears, you know, if there's a guilty verdict, I don't think Donald Trump [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=261.64s)]
*  can get a fair verdict in New York. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=266.0s)]
*  By the time this case would be overturned, guess what, professor? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=269.76s)]
*  It's passed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=275.24s)]
*  It's passed the election. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=276.24s)]
*  It's too late at that point. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=278.12s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=279.12s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=280.2s)]
*  We have about 10 seconds each. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=281.2s)]
*  That's exactly what the purpose was. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=282.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what the goal is. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=283.2s)]
*  Smear him, make him look bad embarrassing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=284.68s)]
*  To get a conviction before appeal. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=285.68s)]
*  And what they should be planning now, right now, is an expedited appeal to get it reversed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=288.68s)]
*  before the election. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=294.68s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=297.12s)]
*  Can that happen, Greg? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=298.2s)]
*  I'm not optimistic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=302.6s)]
*  Three weeks into this trial, and there's still no evidence that Donald Trump committed any [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=304.04s)]
*  crimes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=309.44s)]
*  Nobody has testified that he was involved in the bookkeeping, which is the 34 criminal [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=310.44s)]
*  charges against him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=316.4s)]
*  This is an utterly absurd case. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=318.4s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiZLXh2iU4&t=323.79999999999995s)]
