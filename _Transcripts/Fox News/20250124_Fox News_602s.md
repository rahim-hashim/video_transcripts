# Americans are on our side, GOP Senate majority leader says
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA)
*  So, this week, when I was in D.C., I sat down with the brand-new Senate Majority Leader [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=0.0s)]
*  John Thune of South Dakota. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=7.3s)]
*  We talked about enacting President Trump's agenda, how he's different than Mitch McConnell, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=9.34s)]
*  keeping Republicans unified, and much more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=14.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=16.38s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Thune, congratulations, by the way. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=17.38s)]
*  Thanks, Sean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=20.38s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=21.38s)]
*  You just swore in two more, so you're at 53. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=22.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=24.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=25.38s)]
*  Not too bad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=26.38s)]
*  You had a lot of meetings today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=27.38s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=28.38s)]
*  So, one of them was specifically with President Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  One was just you, Speaker Johnson and the president. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Give us every detail. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=35.12s)]
*  Well, we covered a lot of ground, and, you know, the president, obviously, now he's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=36.6s)]
*  in charge, and it's a great feeling to have him back in the Oval Office and be able to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=41.92s)]
*  work with somebody who shares the objectives, and we have a shared vision for where we want [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  to go for the country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=50.44s)]
*  He wants to, obviously, renew American energy dominance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  He wants to secure the border. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=55.04s)]
*  He wants to rebuild our military. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=56.04s)]
*  He wants to strengthen our economy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=57.72s)]
*  He wants to make sure that we don't have a $4.5 trillion tax increase at the end of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=59.94s)]
*  the year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=61.94s)]
*  So, it's a—these are all things that we agree on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=62.94s)]
*  And just the EOs in the first day, I mean, the tremendous amount of action he's already [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=66.38s)]
*  taken, and I think the people across the country are reacting really well to it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=72.38s)]
*  So, a lot of it today was kind of about how we get there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=76.62s)]
*  So, it's, you know, the strategy, the tactics, etc., but we're all heading the same direction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  It seems different than 2017, in that there seemed to be more Republican reluctance, resistance [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=83.06s)]
*  to President Trump, not anymore. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=88.92s)]
*  Am I right in that perception? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=90.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a fair—I mean, and part of it is—you can't help but notice [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=91.28s)]
*  what happened in the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=96.56s)]
*  I mean, he made history this year, and it was a decisive mandate given to him by the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=97.56s)]
*  American people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  And so I think that it's on all of us, in response to that, to make sure that we're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  being good partners with him to accomplish his agenda. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Let me read to you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=110.44s)]
*  Insider Advantage came out with a poll, and it was very telling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  It just came out last hour, and it says—the question was, I want you, meaning a representative, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=115.74s)]
*  senators and congressmen, to vote in unison to help pass President Trump's appointees [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=123.66s)]
*  and legislative agenda. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  Seventy percent of people want that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=132.46s)]
*  Do your fellow members in the Senate, the members of the House, especially in the House, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=136.46s)]
*  which we'll talk at length about, do they understand that the agenda is that agenda? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=141.42s)]
*  Nobody's ever going to get with everything that they want. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=147.72s)]
*  I might shock some people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  People in Washington don't usually get everything that they want. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=151.88s)]
*  But do your members rank and file? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=154.32s)]
*  They seem to know that? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  They do, and I think they also know that Trump's endorsements can become the gold standard. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=159.98s)]
*  And so if you're a House member, you're running every two years, or even a senator [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=165.16s)]
*  running every six years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=168.0s)]
*  Just the way that he has resonated with the American people, his message about getting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=170.42s)]
*  America back on the rails, back on track, I think has been a powerful one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=176.4s)]
*  And I think that the country's responded, and because of that, I believe members of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=181.36s)]
*  Congress, both House and the Senate, get that we have a window of opportunity here, which [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=185.68s)]
*  doesn't come along very often and sometimes doesn't last very long. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=192.14s)]
*  I mean, we've got the House, the Senate and the White House. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=194.66s)]
*  We have unified control of the government. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=196.44s)]
*  That's a rare thing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=197.92s)]
*  We want to maximize it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  And it's going to take every vote in the House, as we talked about. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  In the Senate, the names I hear most often that people worry about—Susan Collins, who, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  I guess to her credit, remains the only Republican out of New England at this point. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=210.0s)]
*  I'm hoping maybe Scott Brown will get in, and he might run in New Hampshire. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  I think he'd have a good chance there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=217.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=219.16s)]
*  Or maybe Governor Sununu. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=220.16s)]
*  Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and your predecessor, Mitch McConnell, have you spoken with those [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=222.2s)]
*  three? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=227.92s)]
*  Well, I speak to most of them fairly regularly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=228.92s)]
*  And in the job I had prior, which was the whip in the Senate, I had, you know, on any [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  given day—of course, in the last couple of four years, we were playing defense more [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  than offense. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=239.96s)]
*  Now it's about moving the agenda. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=240.96s)]
*  So it's—we've got to get everybody on the team rolling in the same direction. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=241.96s)]
*  So yeah, we talk to them regularly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=247.12s)]
*  And as we move through the nominations, we'll have more conversations, obviously, with them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=248.8s)]
*  You know, as you said, Susan represents a state. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=252.92s)]
*  She's the only Republican in New England, and she's the only person that can win in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=255.6s)]
*  the state of Maine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=258.4s)]
*  And so, obviously, they all bring their own views to this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=259.4s)]
*  And I tell senators, your vote is your vote. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=263.32s)]
*  Be with the team when you can. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=266.44s)]
*  Don't ever surprise us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=267.76s)]
*  You know, don't tell us one thing and do something else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=268.96s)]
*  And so we try and make sure that, as much as we can, we've got everybody pulling together. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=271.88s)]
*  And I think right now there's more of an incentive than we've ever had before. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=277.92s)]
*  We've got a president who came in with a big mandate. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=281.68s)]
*  We clearly have things we need to do to just respond to what the American people are telling [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=284.36s)]
*  us and told us in this election. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=289.52s)]
*  And that is that they're tired of this left-leaning, progressive—when it comes to energy, when [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  it comes to the economy, when it comes to cultural issues, you know, this idea of, you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=297.52s)]
*  know, boys playing girls' sports. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=302.08s)]
*  I think, you know, 90 percent of the American public says, that's just wrong. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=304.0s)]
*  And the Democrats seem to be clinging to that, some of those views. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=307.6s)]
*  And I think that—so, I don't think—no matter where you come from in the country, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=310.68s)]
*  I think a lot of what President Trump campaigned on, a lot of what we want to accomplish, I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=315.12s)]
*  think is going to be a winning issue. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=321.12s)]
*  Mitch McConnell had his issues with Donald Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=323.08s)]
*  Donald Trump had his issues with Mitch McConnell. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=325.68s)]
*  I don't think there's any reason to rehash any of that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=328.2s)]
*  However, Mitch McConnell is in a very unique position, inasmuch as he knows how hard your [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=331.12s)]
*  job is. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=337.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=338.32s)]
*  He seems to be a question mark, especially on some of these cabinet picks, and I want [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=339.52s)]
*  to go over those with you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=343.36s)]
*  Have you had the conversation, Mitch, I'm really going to need your help? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=344.88s)]
*  You know how hard this job can be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=348.32s)]
*  And he's from Kentucky. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=351.2s)]
*  It's not like he's from a blue state in any way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=352.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=354.88s)]
*  I think—and I think he understands his job, obviously, and I expect that he will be doing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=355.88s)]
*  everything he can to help the team, make sure that we're successful. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=360.96s)]
*  He obviously has strong views on national security, foreign policy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=364.92s)]
*  The most interesting Democrat that I see right now, and a person that seems the most independent, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=368.44s)]
*  is John Fetterman from Pennsylvania. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  He supported Israel. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=376.76s)]
*  He's supporting closing the borders. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=378.2s)]
*  Obviously, he's very pro-energy, being from Pennsylvania and fracking. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=380.2s)]
*  But he's also been outspoken that he believes a president should get the cabinet of his [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=384.2s)]
*  choice. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=389.64s)]
*  Have you developed a relationship yet with him? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=390.64s)]
*  Not as much as I should, and I need to. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=392.84s)]
*  We do have—I know members on our side who are talking to Senator Fetterman. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=395.12s)]
*  And I've been impressed by, as you point out, many of the positions that he's taken, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=399.12s)]
*  because— [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=402.72s)]
*  I have to confess, I was wrong about him on a lot of things. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=403.72s)]
*  I was deep in the pain for Oz in that election. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=405.72s)]
*  Well, I think we all were—you know, when he first got here, assuming he was going to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=407.92s)]
*  be sort of a far-left progressive, and I think he surprised a lot of people with positions, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=412.92s)]
*  some of which you mentioned. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=417.12s)]
*  And we've got to find some of those Democrats, obviously, that we can work with. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=418.12s)]
*  And I think that Democrats who are going to run two years from now, they're not for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=422.72s)]
*  re-election, are likely candidates, too, to maybe be supporters of at least some of President [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=425.64s)]
*  Trump's agenda, because I think the American people, right now, they're on our side. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=431.44s)]
*  I've been doing this for a while, and I've heard over the years that we want to limit [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=435.8s)]
*  the size and scope and influence of government in our lives, cut out waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=440.52s)]
*  This to me seems like an opportunity—you've heard about it a lot, too. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=446.52s)]
*  This seems to me to be an opportunity that maybe we'll never get again in our lifetime. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  And President Trump has appointed Elon Musk. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=455.24s)]
*  He's working outside the government to identify areas of waste, fraud and abuse, including [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=458.0s)]
*  the elimination of departments. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  He believes he can cut $2 trillion out of spending. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  We have nearly $40 trillion in debt. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  Is that something you think is so transformative that Senate Republicans are willing—we give [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  lip service to these things, limited government, greater freedom, eliminating waste, fraud [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=479.28s)]
*  and abuse, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=483.96s)]
*  Here's the opportunity. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=484.96s)]
*  Does the Republican Party truly stand for that? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  Isn't that a test now that's coming their way? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=489.88s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think a limited, smaller, more efficient, more effective government has always been [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=492.67999999999995s)]
*  an aspiration for Republicans. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=497.08s)]
*  And what I've noticed in the time I've been here is every spending fight that we [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=498.59999999999997s)]
*  have, Democrats want to spend more, Republicans want to spend less. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  And because of the rules in the Senate, which require 60 votes and some Democrats to get [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  anything done, it's harder to squeeze spending. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=511.16s)]
*  But I think we have, as you point out, a unique opportunity here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=517.28s)]
*  We have a House, Senate and White House, and unify, control the government. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  We can use reconciliation to do some of these things. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=523.72s)]
*  And we ought to be looking as hard as we can through DOJ and other ways of doing that, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=526.16s)]
*  and of course, including Congress and the role that we play in all this, to try and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=531.2s)]
*  reduce the size of government and reduce what, in my view, is the consolidation and centralization [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=536.4s)]
*  of power in Washington. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm a big believer in distributed power. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  I think you get it out of Washington, you know, you get it back— [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=544.28s)]
*  Would education be a scenario? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=546.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=548.52s)]
*  I mean, I think that is a perfect example of what we ought to be able to do, to block [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=549.52s)]
*  grant a lot of that responsibility, decision-making, back to state and local levels, and get it [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=553.72s)]
*  back in the hands of the American people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=560.4s)]
*  And Democrats, through the Inflation Reduction Act, or so-called Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=562.92s)]
*  American Rescue Plan, did what they usually do when they have control of Washington. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=568.24s)]
*  They grow government. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=572.88s)]
*  They believe that government has all the answers, has all the solutions. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=574.2s)]
*  And I think just fundamentally, that's at odds, not only with what makes sense from [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  a common-sense standpoint, but I think it's at odds with where the American people are. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZVfVF5R9GA&t=581.64s)]
