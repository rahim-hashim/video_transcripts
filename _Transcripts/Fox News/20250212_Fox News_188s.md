# Rep. James Comer: The deep state didnâ€™t want these files released
**Fox News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo)
*  Meanwhile, back here at home, President Trump's executive order to declassify JFK, RFK, MLK [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Jr.'s assassination files is making waves. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=6.88s)]
*  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has appointed Congresswoman Anna Paulina [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=10.0s)]
*  Luna to lead a new task force focused on the declassification of these files, along with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=15.44s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's client list, files related to 9-11, the origins of COVID-19, unidentified [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  foreign objects and federal secrets. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=29.12s)]
*  Maybe they can also release the names of congressmen who have nondisclosure agreements that use [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  taxpayer dollars because of relationships they were involved in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Here with the latest, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, along with Congresswoman [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=41.88s)]
*  Anna Paulina Luna. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=45.7s)]
*  Anna, start with you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=47.8s)]
*  It sounds like you want everything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=50.24s)]
*  I hope you'll also consider what I want, too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=51.96s)]
*  Look, we do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=55.2s)]
*  I think that we're in the business of providing transparency to the American people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=57.8s)]
*  And Sean, for too long, the American people have doubted government, rightfully so. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=61.64s)]
*  They held back lots of information that the American people were entitled to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=66.24s)]
*  And I'm just thankful for President Trump being in office. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=70.24s)]
*  Now, I just want to put this out there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=72.24s)]
*  If we find that the president's executive order is stonewalled, I do not put it past [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=74.32s)]
*  Chairman Comer or Speaker Johnson to hold those people in inherent contempt. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=79.6s)]
*  So do not push back against what the president wants. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Declassify this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=87.16s)]
*  The American people deserve this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=88.16s)]
*  And we will be following through on this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=89.16s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=91.16s)]
*  Congressman Comer, why? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=94.36s)]
*  Why have they hidden this information from the American people? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  All of it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  It goes back to the 1960s in three cases? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  I think it's a sign of arrogance. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=106.28s)]
*  Look, it's a sign of government elite thinking that the average person doesn't need to know, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=108.12s)]
*  that they can't handle the truth or that they don't need to know the truth. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=115.04s)]
*  This is their territory. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=118.48s)]
*  This is the deep state. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=119.72s)]
*  The deep state's been around a long time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  It's just been empowered in the last four years under Joe Biden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=122.56s)]
*  And what Donald Trump campaigned on was restoring confidence in the government. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=126.0s)]
*  Right now, the average working, taxpaying American doesn't have a lot of confidence [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  in the federal government. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=135.28s)]
*  And Donald Trump's trying to change that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=136.92s)]
*  He's trying to eliminate wasteful spending and be transparent with the American people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's what our goal is with the task force. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=143.84s)]
*  And Congresswoman Luna is the perfect person to lead this task force. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=147.4s)]
*  She's persistent. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  She's all about transparency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=152.84s)]
*  And I think this is going to be one of the most interesting things Congress does because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=153.84s)]
*  everyone wants to know these secrets that have been held in our government. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=158.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=162.44s)]
*  Congresswoman, how long till this will be released? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=163.44s)]
*  We have to roll. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=165.88s)]
*  We have a couple of days, but it will be all available to the American people and our first [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=168.88s)]
*  hearing will be noticed publicly in March. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  We really appreciate both of you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=175.56s)]
*  Thank you for your transparency. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WES6IsyBo&t=177.16s)]
