# Obama met privately with Biden, worries Trump could win 2024: Report
**Fox News:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8)
*  All right, Biden's campaign is floundering. Democrats are sounding the alarm. According [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=0.0s)]
*  to a breaking report, former President Barack Obama met privately with Biden on at least [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=6.04s)]
*  two occasions, expressing his concern that Donald Trump's going to win in November. Here [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=11.8s)]
*  with reaction, Project 21 Chairman Horace Cooper and Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=17.04s)]
*  Tammy, we got that news today and also the danger. I watched this minibus or omnibus bill [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=22.919999999999998s)]
*  pass. They didn't give members of Congress much time to read it. And I know Marjorie [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=31.92s)]
*  Taylor Greene is thinking about a motion to vacate. Matt Gaetz, interestingly, said that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=37.56s)]
*  could result in a speaker, Hakeem Jeffries. That wouldn't be good. What's your reaction [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  to both stories? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=48.2s)]
*  Well, I think it's not surprising that Obama, who sees this as a continuation of his legacy, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=49.36s)]
*  would get nervous when they realize that they've lost the American people. Part of his warning [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  to Biden was that, of course, this is going to be harder than 2020. And the reason it's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=60.6s)]
*  going to be harder than 2020 is because they can't lie about what Joe Biden is going to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=65.56s)]
*  do, about who Joe Biden is, about what the agenda is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=69.92s)]
*  They went all out in 2016, 2020, I should say, to paint Biden as somebody that he was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=74.12s)]
*  not. It was a romantic view of him. We're going to be back to normal. Trump is a maniac. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  And what we have now is four years of looking back and realize how much we were lied to, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  how much there was the basement strategy to trick the American people, and the results [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=92.92s)]
*  of policies that were the dream policies, frankly, of the Democrats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  So now they can't lie about those things. His advice was to make it all about Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=104.36s)]
*  But I'm telling you, Sean, clearly they knew this was going to be the case with the lawfare, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  the degree to which they are going through the courts to destroy this man financially [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=115.35999999999999s)]
*  and emotionally, perhaps, and they think they're going to throw him in jail. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  I baked all that in into my continuing support. They will do all of that because they know [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=125.48s)]
*  and this is for us and it's good news that they can't lie to us anymore, that they can't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=131.56s)]
*  trick us about who this is and what the future is going to look like, which is a dumpster [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  fire if this continues to happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=141.96s)]
*  One last thing about Barack Obama. He knows what's happened to the country and he wants [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=144.68s)]
*  it to continue. And if he's the one giving advice, ask Hillary Clinton how good the Barack [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=149.86s)]
*  Obama advice is and if this is a guy who knows everything about how to win because she's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  sitting there drinking her Chardonnay, not in the White House. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=160.62s)]
*  Okay. I'm glad I didn't know she liked Chardonnay. However, anyway, Horace, good to see you again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=164.66000000000003s)]
*  Let's look demographically because we're watching Joe Biden, Kamala Harris now trying [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=171.86s)]
*  to shore up the Democratic coalition, the disparate groups that usually are part of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  the Democratic base. Demographically, you're looking at Joe Biden that got 90 plus percent [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  of the African American vote. He's down to 66 percent. He's down over 20 some odd points [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=188.42s)]
*  with Hispanic Americans, down over 20 points with young Americans and suburban women. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  I think the issues that Tammy just discussed, you know, it's impacting everybody's life [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=202.3s)]
*  from the economy to the border, to law and order and safety and security. People are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=207.78s)]
*  looking at what's going on around the world and they're like, where's America? We've [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=213.22s)]
*  abdicated our role on the world stage. So cumulatively, how do they get people back [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  that are part of their normal base, especially when these policies are not helping them? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=224.12s)]
*  Well, let me say that I agree with Tammy that there was a major effort to lie to the American [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  people in 2020. However, that was not unique. That has actually been since I was a kid the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  game plan for the left. We're going to lie. I feel your pain. We're going to say whatever [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=246.38000000000002s)]
*  we think we need to say to the American people to get their support. The problem is that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  the governing by this administration has been nothing short of a dumpster fire. The American [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=261.7s)]
*  people across the board are suffering from this. We are seeing more foreclosures. We [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=270.1s)]
*  have seen more repossessions. We're seeing record numbers of Americans having to use [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=278.1s)]
*  the credit card just to buy basics at the grocery store. The truth of the matter is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  what Mr. Obama might want to try to tell Mr. Biden to do is the truth is, should say, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=294.18s)]
*  I was wrong. And I'm going to start with some really proactive steps like doing something [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=301.18s)]
*  about closing up the border. The problem is this administration is committed to the very, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=311.26s)]
*  very far left. They don't have the flexibility. I'm sitting here watching the president of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=319.3s)]
*  the United States, Joe Biden, and the president of the United States in primary after primary [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=326.3s)]
*  where hundreds of thousands of their voters are saying anybody but Joe because Joe's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=333.5s)]
*  not far left crazy enough. This is the problem. It's a dumpster fire. Whisper all you want, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=339.5s)]
*  Mr. Obama. It's just not going to work. It's Jimmy Carter 2.0, maybe even worse if that's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=347.62s)]
*  possible. Anyway, Tammy, thank you. Great to see you, Horace. Thank you as well. We appreciate [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=355.38s)]
*  it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfvEJFWLU8&t=360.38s)]
