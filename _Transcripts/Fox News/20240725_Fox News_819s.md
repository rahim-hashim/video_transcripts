# Sean Hannity: Kamala's failures are well documented
**Fox News:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, extremism and bigotry is festering inside the Democratic Party. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=2.58s)]
*  Far-left individuals who hate our country, our way of life, they are desecrating our [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=7.38s)]
*  flag, vandalizing our monuments and openly supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=12.48s)]
*  In response, the Biden-Harris administration can barely muster a yawn. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=18.88s)]
*  Joe, as per usual, is barely able to get through the day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=23.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's newly anointed presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=27.52s)]
*  summoned just enough courage to release a written statement politely condemning the pro-Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  riots, you know, the people burning our flags and so on and so forth. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=38.28s)]
*  But don't expect any big virtuous speeches condemning this extremism. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=43.08s)]
*  You see, Kamala does not have the moral courage to call out her own radical side. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=47.44s)]
*  Remember, she supported that bail fund after the police precinct was burned down in Minneapolis. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  Four days, she tweeted out a support for the bail fund after the precinct's burned down, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=59.6s)]
*  said, the riots, they're not going to stop. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=65.12s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=67.6s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=68.6s)]
*  Plus, she said, and she needs the radicals—we all know this—in her party to vote for her. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=70.08s)]
*  God forbid she stand up to them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, despite the honeymoon and the sugar high and the days after Kamala's ascension, a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=79.08s)]
*  brand new Emerson College poll found that Trump is still leading in key battleground [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=83.84s)]
*  states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  It's tied in Wisconsin. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=91.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is up by two nationwide in a New York Times poll. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=93.08s)]
*  And despite all the glowing coverage from the state-run media mob, Harris is struggling [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  to hide her radical record. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=103.14s)]
*  And by the way, on this show, our vetting has only begun. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=104.92s)]
*  Now today, House Democrats were sent this memo begging them to pretend that Kamala's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=109.04s)]
*  Borders are title was invented out of nowhere by Republicans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=114.92s)]
*  The document goes on to detail how Kamala really wasn't involved with the border, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=119.38s)]
*  even though she was second in command at the Biden administration for the past three years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  It was specifically tasked with preventing illegal immigrants from several different [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=129.76s)]
*  countries. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=135.76s)]
*  That was her job, according to our own Bill Molluskian. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  Illegal immigration is up a whopping 140 percent from those countries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  But Kamala, like Joe and Mayorkas, they lied to you for three straight years, telling you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  the border's secure, the border's secure, the border's closed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=150.92s)]
*  It was a big lie, just like covering up and lying about Joe's cognitive state, just like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  lying about the inflation problem being transitory. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  This is a huge problem for Kamala's campaign. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=164.12s)]
*  Her failures, her extreme positions are well documented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=167.0s)]
*  It's on tape. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=170.6s)]
*  It's in her own words. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=171.6s)]
*  For example, let's go down memory lane, Kamala in her own words, and here she is talking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=172.8s)]
*  about leading the administration's efforts at the border. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=178.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=182.8s)]
*  So, the important aspect of this visit is leading this visit after the work that we [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=194.12s)]
*  did in Guatemala and Mexico. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=203.72s)]
*  Because as I've long said, I said back in March I was going to come to the border, so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=204.72s)]
*  this is not a new plan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=208.32s)]
*  She sounds like the borders are. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=210.88s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=212.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris owns the border crisis, as does Joe. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=213.4s)]
*  They both have blood on their hands for every rape or re-murder that has occurred by their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=216.96s)]
*  11-plus million unvetted illegal immigrants from over 180 countries, including countries [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=222.16s)]
*  with terror ties and our top geopolitical foes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=227.44s)]
*  And to this day, she has done absolutely nothing to solve the crisis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=230.56s)]
*  In fact, House Republicans and Democrats, they just passed a resolution condemning Kamala [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=234.12s)]
*  Harris' failure at the border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  And don't forget, last night we showed you her repeated pleas for illegal immigration [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=241.34s)]
*  to be decriminalized, wanted them to have free healthcare and education that you pay [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=246.44s)]
*  for. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=251.92s)]
*  And tonight, here's Kamala Harris suggesting that immigration and customs enforcement should [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=252.92s)]
*  be abolished. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=257.52s)]
*  Take a close look. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=259.4s)]
*  A lot of the signs at the rally you just held were people standing there saying, abolish [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=260.4s)]
*  ICE. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=264.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=265.52s)]
*  Is that a position that you agree with? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=266.52s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically re-examine ICE and its role [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=268.76s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=274.04s)]
*  And we need to probably think about starting from scratch, because there's a lot that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=276.96s)]
*  is wrong with the way that it is conducting itself, and we need to deal with that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  And she falsely accused ICE people of whipping immigrants, was not true, never apologized. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=287.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris essentially called for America's borders to be dissolved, and that's exactly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=293.64s)]
*  what has happened. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  But her commitment to upending the law and law and order in our country doesn't stop [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=300.32s)]
*  at the border. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  Last night, we detailed great specificity, Kamala's efforts to raise money for that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  bail fund that freed murderers, rapists, violent rioters from 2020's mostly peaceful summer [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=311.6s)]
*  of love, anything but. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  But get this, at the time, she also frequently toyed with an insane plan to defund, dismantle, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  reimagine the police. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=327.72s)]
*  And according to Kamala, fewer police means a safer America, in her own words. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=329.0s)]
*  Are you for defunding the police? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  How are you defining defund the police? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=338.48s)]
*  Talk to me about the defund the police movement, and what do you think is the most, the first [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=340.72s)]
*  piece of legislation that should happen towards reforming the police? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=346.04s)]
*  So at its essence, Andy, it really, I believe, is about reimagining public safety and how [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=352.36s)]
*  we achieve it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=359.72s)]
*  You know, for far too long, the status quo thinking has been to believe that by putting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=361.18s)]
*  more police on the street, you're going to have more safety. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=366.62s)]
*  And that's just wrong. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=369.34s)]
*  It's just, that's not how it works. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=370.34s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=372.14s)]
*  Not how it works. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=374.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't just want fewer police. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=375.3s)]
*  She's also in favor of removing penalties for a variety of crimes, including certain [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=377.86s)]
*  drug offenses, which is ironic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=383.46s)]
*  I'll explain in a minute, but in her own words, take a listen. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=385.34s)]
*  They say you oppose legalizing weed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=388.86s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=391.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=392.06s)]
*  And look, I joke about it, have joking. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=393.06s)]
*  I have my families from Jamaica. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=395.06s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=396.42s)]
*  Have you ever smoked? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=397.42s)]
*  I have. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=398.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=399.42s)]
*  And I inhaled. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=400.42s)]
*  I did inhale. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=401.42s)]
*  It was a long time ago. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=402.42s)]
*  I know you have to go. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=403.42s)]
*  They say you have to go. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=404.42s)]
*  I just want to die. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=405.42s)]
*  I just broke loose. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=406.42s)]
*  I mean, was it in college? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=407.42s)]
*  See, I like stuff like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=408.42s)]
*  That's a real hundred things. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=409.42s)]
*  Was it a blunt or joint? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=410.42s)]

*  Hey! [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=422.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=423.42s)]
*  Remember the high? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=424.42s)]
*  I do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=425.42s)]
*  So if it was legalized all throughout the country and medicinal, would you, you know, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=426.42s)]
*  do it? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=430.38s)]
*  Listen, I think that it gives a lot of people joy, and we need more joy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=431.38s)]
*  We need more joy in the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=434.9s)]
*  We should have a poll. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=436.9s)]
*  What's worse, the answer or the giggling? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=438.7s)]
*  And while Kamala was joking about smoking weed, it is important to remember that as [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  Francisco, Kamala Harris locked up quite a few people for that exact crime, including [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=446.5s)]
*  many African American men. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=452.58s)]
*  But apparently as the political winds change, so did Kamala Harris. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=454.62s)]
*  Now as a born-again socialist to the left of Bernie Sanders, she doesn't even want violent [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=459.5s)]
*  criminals behind bars. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=465.5s)]
*  And as we showed you last night, she thinks if you're between the ages of 18 and 24, that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=466.9s)]
*  stupid in her own words. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=472.97999999999996s)]
*  What's the other thing we know about this population? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=476.58s)]
*  And it's a specific phase of life. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=478.78s)]
*  Remember, age is more than a chronological fact. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=480.58s)]
*  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=483.29999999999995s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=486.7s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=490.85999999999996s)]
*  And they have a resident assistant. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  They make really bad decisions. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=497.82s)]
*  A lot of older adult politicians, I'd say they're pretty stupid, too. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=502.34s)]
*  Now she is demanding equity for all. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=506.61999999999995s)]
*  Not equality, but equity. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  In other words, in Kamala's dream society, it won't matter how hard you work or how [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=510.34s)]
*  smart you are or the quality of your decisions as an individual. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=515.38s)]
*  Everyone, regardless of merit, will end up in the exact same place in her own words. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=519.6999999999999s)]
*  And if the goal is truly about equality, it has to be about a goal of saying everybody [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=526.66s)]
*  should end up in the same place. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=531.36s)]
*  And since we didn't start in the same place, some folks might need more. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=532.96s)]
*  Equitable distribution. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=537.52s)]
*  It's about giving people the resources and the support they need so that everyone can [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=538.52s)]
*  be on equal footing and then compete on equal footing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=545.0s)]
*  So there's a big difference between equality and equity. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=549.32s)]
*  Equality suggests often everybody should get the same thing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=553.96s)]
*  Well, that often assumes everybody started out in the same place, as opposed to equity, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  which is everyone should end up in the same place. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=566.8399999999999s)]
*  And if you then understand not everybody started out in the same place, you understand some [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=570.64s)]
*  people need more. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like a real life Saturday Night Lives kit. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=575.8s)]
*  Now, what's in line? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  That's in line, obviously, with her support of a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=581.76s)]
*  That'll disincentivize everybody from working. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=589.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=592.02s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's new darling of the party, she officially has more Twitter [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=593.02s)]
*  followers than Nancy Pelosi. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical, and she's promoting [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=598.06s)]
*  policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=602.62s)]
*  be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=606.54s)]
*  Do you agree that she could possibly, in this ideology of the socialist left, could splinter [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=611.34s)]
*  your party? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=615.38s)]
*  No. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=616.74s)]
*  You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=617.74s)]
*  I think that's fantastic. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=622.66s)]
*  I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=624.3s)]
*  Fantastic ideas. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=630.66s)]
*  Communism has failed everywhere in the world, but apparently, Kamala would like to give [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=632.7s)]
*  it one more shot. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=636.98s)]
*  Right here in the good old U.S. survey, all in the name of equity. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=638.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris is far more radical than Joe Biden, Barack Obama combined, but she does [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=643.3000000000001s)]
*  share his love of public transportation. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=649.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=653.26s)]
*  So, here's the thing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=654.26s)]
*  Who doesn't love a yellow school bus? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=657.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=659.1800000000001s)]
*  Can you raise your hand if you love a yellow school bus? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=662.82s)]
*  Just, there's something about the — and most of us, many of us, went to school on [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=663.82s)]
*  the yellow school bus, right? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=669.62s)]
*  And it's part of our experience growing up. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=672.78s)]
*  It's part of, you know, a nostalgia and a memory of the excitement and joy of going [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  to school, to be with your favorite teacher, to be with your best friends, and to learn. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=683.3s)]
*  The school bus takes us there. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=690.9799999999999s)]
*  I don't like school buses myself, but that's my own personal taste. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=692.8599999999999s)]
*  Didn't Joe Biden try to prevent the integration of schools and busing? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=698.46s)]
*  And she was that girl, she said in that debate, because Joe partnered with the former Klansman [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=702.94s)]
*  to stop the integration of schools. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=708.86s)]
*  He didn't want schools, in his words, to be racial jungles. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, in addition to hyping up America's school buses, Vice President Harris was also [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  tasked with the mission to bring the wonders of space to communities all across America [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=719.1s)]
*  and to fulfill this very vague mission. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=724.74s)]
*  Kamala hired several child actors and created a short film showing her, well, awkwardly [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=727.4200000000001s)]
*  talking to these child actors about planets while they pretended to be interested. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=732.58s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=738.3000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=739.3000000000001s)]
*  I just love the idea of exploring the unknown. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  And then there's other things that we just haven't figured out or discovered yet. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=744.98s)]
*  To think about so much that's out there that we still have to learn. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=748.82s)]
*  Like, I love that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=754.98s)]
*  I'm very excited about the space council. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=755.98s)]
*  We're going to learn so much. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=757.58s)]
*  You guys are going to see, you're going to literally see the craters on the moon with [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=759.86s)]
*  your own eyes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=764.98s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=765.98s)]
*  With your own eyes, I'm telling you, it is going to be unbelievable. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=766.98s)]
*  So tonight, with just 54 days until early voting begins in Pennsylvania and then around [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=774.1800000000001s)]
*  the country, and only 102 days until November the 5th, do you really want to take a chance [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=778.5s)]
*  on an incompetent politician with a radical, extreme far left agenda? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=783.98s)]
*  Or do you want to return to the Trump years? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=788.34s)]
*  Low taxes, lower interest rates, lower gas prices, no inflation, secure borders, law [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=790.38s)]
*  and order, peace and prosperity for all, and the world's dictators not running wild around [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=796.3s)]
*  the world because they actually respect the president? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=802.18s)]
*  The choice has never been more clear. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQIHPDCwJw&t=805.14s)]
