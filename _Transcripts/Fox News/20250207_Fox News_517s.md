# 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG': Elon Musk's DOGE strikes fear in DC
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A)
*  Elon Musk and Doge are making quick work of intensifying wasteful woe government spending, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=0.0s)]
*  but saving your taxpayer dollars has sent Democrats into a complete spiral, actually [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  entertaining at times. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  As usual, they appear hell-bent on doing nothing but fighting President Trump every step of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=16.32s)]
*  the way. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=21.54s)]
*  Everything he does, they feign moral outrage, and this is a constitutional crisis. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=22.78s)]
*  Last night, Senate Democrats spoke on the floor throughout the entire night, wasting [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=29.18s)]
*  their time protesting Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=33.1s)]
*  His name is Russell Voigt. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=37.7s)]
*  And Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, well, he brought back the left's campaign talking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=39.7s)]
*  point, declaring in a post on X that democracy is on the line, constitutional crisis, he [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=44.5s)]
*  was screaming the other day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=51.58s)]
*  Now, of course, their efforts were to no avail, as Russell Voigt was, in fact, confirmed earlier [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=52.86s)]
*  this evening and is set to be sworn in tomorrow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=58.18s)]
*  Here with reaction, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and the former White House [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=60.62s)]
*  Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=65.16s)]
*  There's only really one way to put this, is the band is back together. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=67.02s)]
*  You know, the founders of the Freedom Caucus back together. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=70.98s)]
*  This is a great moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=75.12s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=77.74s)]
*  Without a doubt, without a doubt. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=78.74s)]
*  Do I start with the chief or do I start with the head of the Judiciary Committee? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=80.74s)]
*  It's kind of hard to tell. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=84.5s)]
*  Head of the Judiciary, head of the Judiciary. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=85.82s)]
*  Chief, I'm going to start with you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=88.82s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=92.42s)]
*  It's been a while since we've had you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=93.42s)]
*  You know, it's very predictable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=94.42s)]
*  I think Elon Musk has, what he has done is a great service to this country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=98.14s)]
*  The average American makes 66 grand a year. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=103.26s)]
*  I don't know what the average North Carolinian makes where you live. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=105.7s)]
*  66 grand a year is not a lot. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  Those people pay a lot in taxes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=111.98s)]
*  Same with the people in Ohio and the same with people all around the country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=113.82s)]
*  And when you see hundreds of billions of dollars, and this is the tip of the iceberg, that are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  being wasted, and Joe Biden, we now know, wasted a quarter, over 236 billion dollars [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=123.34s)]
*  last year that we know of. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=131.46s)]
*  I mean, why would people be angry at that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  And this is not money going to America, but it's going around the world? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, they should be angry, Russ. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=141.42s)]
*  Russ' vote is going to be able to help you mention him getting confirmed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=144.42s)]
*  But listen, the only thing that's faster than an Elon Musk Tesla is Donald Trump and his [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=147.98s)]
*  team making sure that the American people are back in control. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=153.62s)]
*  And what we're seeing here is that Donald Trump has instilled hope in America and fear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=157.7s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=164.14s)]
*  Wouldn't it have been better if those billions of dollars had been sent to Western North [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=165.7s)]
*  Carolina to actually rebuild instead of some DEI, woke kind of trans deal in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=169.78s)]
*  Ireland or across the country in Africa? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  You know, it is just unbelievable what we've seen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=182.42s)]
*  But yet what we are seeing right now is President Trump putting his foot on the gas and going [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=186.06s)]
*  from zero to 60 in two seconds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=191.7s)]
*  You know, it's a great way to put it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=194.78s)]
*  I think Elon Musk, you know, first of all, his personal accomplishments have benefited [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=197.1s)]
*  every human being on this earth. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=201.78s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=203.54s)]
*  He's going to rescue our astronauts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=204.54s)]
*  He helped the people of North Carolina, the people in Tennessee, the people in California, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=206.78s)]
*  and he did it for free. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=210.26s)]
*  And this is the thanks that this guy gets for, you know, transforming American communications, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  American automobiles, American space travel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=221.66s)]
*  And now he's trying to transform American government so we save taxpayers money and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=225.18s)]
*  we can live within our means. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  And this is how he gets treated, Jim? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=231.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=233.66s)]
*  What's going on here is when you spend money on stupid things, you attack the guy who exposes [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=234.82s)]
*  it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=239.7s)]
*  That's exactly what Democrats are doing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=240.7s)]
*  The proponents of big government, the recipients of big government spending, they just as soon [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=241.94s)]
*  keep all that secret. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  But Elon Musk comes along and says, this is ridiculous. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=248.5s)]
*  As Mark put it out, some trans opera in Ireland, they're funding Sesame Street shows in Iraq. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=250.94s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=256.42s)]
*  China's building bridges and roads in certain countries and we're putting Big Bird and Bert [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=257.9s)]
*  and Ernie on TV in Baghdad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=262.62s)]
*  Who do you think is going to have more influence? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=264.58s)]
*  So what Elon Musk is saying, this is stupid. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=266.24s)]
*  Let's stop it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=268.9s)]
*  Let's focus on serving the American people, not having these agencies do what they want. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=269.9s)]
*  Here's another thing, Sean. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=274.22s)]
*  Ten thousand people work at USAID. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=275.46s)]
*  One thousand of those ten thousand, over ten percent of those individuals, one month [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=277.78s)]
*  after Hamas attacks our best friend, the state of Israel, one month later, those one thousand [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  people did an open letter calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=287.05999999999995s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=290.64s)]
*  So of course we need to scale this agency back and get rid of some of those people who [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=291.9s)]
*  have that attitude and are saying those kind of things about our dear friend and ally, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=300.32s)]
*  You know, Mark Meadows, I really pride myself in doing a lot of research. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  And we spend a lot of time looking for waste fraud and abuse. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=307.56s)]
*  I know Senator Joni Ernst had requested this information repeatedly and they use obscure [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  names to really hide where the money goes and what the money went for. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=319.88s)]
*  I grew up in, when I grew up in New York, and thank God I don't live there anymore, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  we used to call that fraud. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=330.52s)]
*  What do you call it? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I call it fraud and that's even a nice name for it when you look at it, Sean. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  And you did do the research and yet what we saw was the Doge team goes in, they're actually [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  looking through the checkbook and say, where is the money going? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=346.52s)]
*  And you said it in your monologue. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=349.76s)]
*  This is the tip of the iceberg. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=351.46s)]
*  Wait until they start looking at all the grants that are coming out of HHS and the Education [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  Department. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  It will blow the American people's minds. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=360.2s)]
*  And why are we getting the big pushback from Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=362.8s)]
*  They're afraid that the American people will finally start to see behind the curtain. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=368.12s)]
*  And we can thank Donald Trump for that because no one else would have had the courage to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=374.04s)]
*  make sure that that happened. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=378.16s)]
*  And thank Elon Musk for actually staying the course. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=379.8s)]
*  When everybody is out to basically demonize him, know that indeed it's an attack on the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=383.56s)]
*  American people and an attack on this president. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=389.52s)]
*  You know, Jim Jordan, if they want to die, Democrats on this hill, and that is, you know, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=392.96s)]
*  all this, the billions and tens of billions and hundreds of billions of dollars in money [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  go into other countries for their woke agenda, and they think that's going to be helpful [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=404.4s)]
*  politically. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=408.4s)]
*  If they want to die on the hill of sanctuary cities and states and defend the terrorists, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=409.84s)]
*  the murderers, rapists, cartels and gangs, I'm perfectly fine with their stupidity. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  How about you? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=419.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if they want to do that, you know, God bless them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  I think it's wrong. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=423.32s)]
*  I think that's why they lost on November 5th. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=424.56s)]
*  I think it's why 77 million people voted for President Trump. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  And frankly, I think the American people like the intensity and the speed and the focused [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=429.73999999999995s)]

*  And they like, I think, what Elon Musk is showing them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=437.14s)]

*  Twitter. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=450.06s)]
*  I spent $44 billion to save the First Amendment. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=451.06s)]

*  Big government telling big tech to censor Americans. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=459.12s)]

*  the people I get the privilege of representing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=474.68s)]
*  I know the people back home are pleased with the effort of President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=476.48s)]
*  and what he's uncovering. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=480.88000000000005s)]

*  And it will shock the soul of this country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=496.6s)]
*  And they have a lot of explaining to do. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=499.6s)]
*  The dynamic duo is back. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=501.92s)]
*  Mark Meadows, Congressman Jim Jordan. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P3Snt8W3A&t=503.88s)]
