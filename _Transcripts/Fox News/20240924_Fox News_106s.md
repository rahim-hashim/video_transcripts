# Voter issues chilling warning on Kamala Harris' border policies: 'Waiting for the next 9/11'
**Fox News:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ)
*  Because our very own Sarah Carter, she talked to voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=0.0s)]
*  They're not happy. Take a look. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=3.04s)]
*  Is it frustrating to see all the people that have come in because they haven't been properly vetted? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=5.36s)]
*  It's just been an illegal influx. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=9.28s)]
*  So you have a lot of criminal networks from Venezuela, from other parts of the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I mean, mixed in with the good people, but there's so many criminals flooding in, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=15.52s)]
*  they're not going to be able to find them all to get them out. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=19.36s)]
*  Exactly. Once they're in, it's a lot harder to just, you know, get them out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=21.44s)]
*  So it's just a never-ending cycle with this administration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=24.8s)]
*  I think at this point right now, with the amount of people that have come across on the terrorist list, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=29.44s)]
*  we're just waiting for the next 9-11 basically to occur. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=32.88s)]
*  So I take it that you would not be all about open borders policy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=35.84s)]
*  Oh my God. Who would? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=40.64s)]
*  How about the border issue, the border crisis? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=42.08s)]
*  Terrible. That should have never happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=43.84s)]
*  Should have never happened. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=46.64s)]
*  Should have never happened. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=47.92s)]
*  How do you feel about the fact that Kamala Harris in the past has supported the policy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=49.2s)]
*  to use taxpayer dollars to pay for transgender surgery for illegal detained migrants? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=55.28s)]
*  It's ridiculous. She's spending money on people that don't even belong here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=62.32s)]
*  We're not even taking care of the people that are here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=64.72s)]
*  You know, even like our own vets, people that are veterans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=66.8s)]
*  I mean, everyday civilians that live here in our own country, we're not even dealing with our own people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=69.44s)]
*  To use taxpayer dollars to do that is kind of a betrayal of us as the American people, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=73.68s)]
*  especially us as cattle ranchers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=79.68s)]
*  I mean, we pay for a lot of stuff. We work our fingers through the bone day in, day out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=81.92s)]
*  So to hear that is kind of like a backstab. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=88.08s)]
*  Four more years of Kamala would be a disaster. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=90.16s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News' YouTube page [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbyuaFo3lQ&t=93.84s)]
