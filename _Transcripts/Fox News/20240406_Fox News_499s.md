# New York prosecutor questions insurer providing Trump's $175M bond
**Fox News:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY)
*  Earlier in the week, former President Donald Trump posted the $175 million bond in his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=0.0s)]
*  civil fraud trial, allowing him to appeal the insane judgment against him from a clearly [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=7.0s)]
*  biased judge, an attorney general fulfilling a campaign promise to get one man, one family, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=14.68s)]
*  one organization. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=20.36s)]
*  Now the AG of New York has apparently decided she's not happy with the payment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=22.16s)]
*  Oh, imagine that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=26.72s)]
*  She is officially taking exception to the bond and demanding that either Trump or the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=28.4s)]
*  bond company prove that they will be able to pay it out when called upon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=32.92s)]
*  But the Trump organization says the bond is fully backed by cash and AG James is just [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=38.12s)]
*  continuing what is a harassment campaign. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=44.04s)]
*  Here with reaction is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Fox News, Legal Analyst [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=47.28s)]
*  Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Pam, let's get your take. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=54.72s)]
*  It's backed up by cash is my understanding. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=56.26s)]
*  So if they were to get the bond payment, it would be handed over in a day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  Why is there a problem here? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=65.46s)]
*  There's not, Sean. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=69.3s)]
*  This is completely contrived. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=70.3s)]
*  I am convinced of this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=71.98s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=74.3s)]
*  She filed this motion and within 10 minutes, Judge Ingeron gave a hearing date. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=75.3s)]
*  Greg will tell you in New York, in any jurisdiction, that does not happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=83.14s)]
*  Her puppet, Judge Ingeron, set this hearing date immediately. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=89.74s)]
*  I believe this is Letitia James trying to stay in the news cycle because she's become [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=93.62s)]
*  irrelevant and this case will get reversed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=98.7s)]
*  You know, the judge, the court, the appellate court ordered a TRO, which is a stay in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=102.38s)]
*  case, which means there's a substantial likelihood that President Trump will be successful on [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=107.1s)]
*  the merits in this case. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=112.78s)]
*  This case will get reversed and yes, the bond was posted. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=114.98s)]
*  She's just trying to stay relevant right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=119.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=121.38s)]
*  Let's get your take, Greg Jarrett. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=122.38s)]
*  And also, I saw your column writing about how the judge should be conflicted out in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=123.84s)]
*  the Alvin Bragg case. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=130.02s)]
*  If you can explain that as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=131.66s)]
*  Well, this is another example of vindictive and abusive behavior by Letitia James. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=134.06s)]
*  Trump paid all cash. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=141.66s)]
*  Right, Sean, for the $175 million bond. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=142.74s)]
*  It's fully collateralized. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=145.38s)]
*  It's a valid bond. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=146.94s)]
*  James, who got spanked by the appellate court, is now trying an end run to disqualify the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=148.34s)]
*  surety company, claiming it's not a standard carrier in New York. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=154.98s)]
*  Well, I got news for her that's not required because this is an excess carrier. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=159.14s)]
*  As long as it has sufficient capital and it does over a billion in equity, then it's approved [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=164.16s)]
*  to issue Trump's bond. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=170.04s)]
*  Pam's right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=172.5s)]
*  The truth is, James got humiliated by the higher court. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=173.5s)]
*  She's desperate to stop Trump's appeal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  She knows she's going to lose. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=178.72s)]
*  She doesn't care about the law, only about fulfilling her campaign vowed and nailed Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=180.61999999999998s)]
*  by hook or by crook. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  And as for the other case, Judge Merchant in the Alvin Bragg hush money case, he should [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  recuse himself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=195.61999999999998s)]
*  First of all, his gag order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, and he's conflicted [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=196.98s)]
*  out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  As reported, his daughter has a financial interest in the outcome of her dad's case [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=207.78s)]
*  because she and her client, she runs a firm that raises money for politicians, has made [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=214.42s)]
*  the tune of some $93 million, according to the New York Post, by promoting and soliciting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=222.14s)]
*  money by citing her father's case. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=228.62s)]
*  That's a violation of judicial ethics. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=231.7s)]
*  It demands recusal by the judge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=234.46s)]
*  And by the way, representing people like Adam Schiff, let's get your take on that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=238.1s)]
*  Pam, should the judge be conflicted out here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, Sean. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=245.5s)]
*  His daughter has been in the news, and then he puts a gag order on the president saying [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  that he can't talk about this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=255.89999999999998s)]
*  That's his First Amendment right, his right to defend himself publicly about these allegations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=258.5s)]
*  I think that's one of the most egregious things, frankly, that's happened in this case. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  He absolutely needs to recuse himself, no doubt in my mind. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  But he won't. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=273.78s)]
*  But Pam, this is not our first rodeo. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=274.78s)]
*  We saw it with Manafort and Roger Stone. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=276.74s)]
*  They couldn't even use social media to say, proclaim their innocence. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  And if they did open their mouth, they were told very clearly, they'd be sent right to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=286.18s)]
*  jail. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=290.38s)]
*  Don't pass go, go straight to jail. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=291.38s)]
*  And that's what they want to do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=296.02s)]
*  They want to put Donald Trump in jail. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=297.02s)]
*  There's no exemption in the First Amendment that protects judges or their adult children [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  who are fundraising off their father, the judge's case. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=307.18s)]
*  Almost all of these gag orders are unconstitutional. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=311.7s)]
*  The trouble is, by the time a defendant seeks an appeal successfully, the case is over. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=315.1s)]
*  The trial has been had. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=320.62s)]
*  So judges do it with impunity, even though they shouldn't. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=322.1s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  I would think this is an issue at some point. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  I'd like to see the Supreme Court, Pam, bond the way in on. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=330.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, Judge Ingeron got away with it, if you recall, saying, you can't talk [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  about my clerk. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=339.5s)]
*  President Trump can say whatever he wants to about the clerk. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=341.82s)]
*  But of course, he had to abide by the gag order. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=344.9s)]
*  And now this judge is following suit about his daughter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=347.82s)]
*  The president has a right to defend himself. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=351.02s)]
*  He is the leading candidate for the next American presidency, and he has the right to defend [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=353.34s)]
*  himself. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=358.46s)]
*  He has the first amendment right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=359.46s)]
*  And there's nothing more they would want than to see him in jail. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=361.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=365.06s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=366.06s)]
*  Let me ask both of you this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=367.94s)]
*  Do you, of the cases that are brought against President Trump, the Bragg case, the D.C. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=369.94s)]
*  case, the Fulton County, Georgia case, the Florida case, how many of them will be tried [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=375.82s)]
*  before Election Day in 213 days? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=382.46s)]
*  What's your best guess? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=386.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, it looks like the only one that we're going to get to anytime soon is the Alvin [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=388.38s)]
*  Bragg case, which is supposed to happen in a week. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=395.66s)]
*  The judge won't recuse himself. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  He should. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=400.86s)]
*  I don't think there's enough time to get him removed through an order by the higher court. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=401.86s)]
*  You know, and this is the weakest of all cases. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=406.86s)]
*  But you've got a New York jury that hates Trump and a biased judge. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  What's your take, Pam? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=416.66s)]
*  Yeah, the same. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=419.66s)]
*  The other cases will get continued. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=420.66s)]
*  The other ones are on appeal. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=421.66s)]
*  The Alvin Bragg case most likely will go. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  And you know, people need to remember he has to be sitting in that courtroom. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  He can't be on the campaign trail if that goes to trial. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=431.62s)]
*  So they're going to try to appeal it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=435.82000000000005s)]
*  But I'm scared it's going to go to trial. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=439.1s)]
*  Americans see this for what it is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unnU4qbE2fY&t=440.1s)]
