# Newt Gingrich: Kamala Harris will never be able to get away from this
**Fox News:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E)
*  As former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=3.12s)]
*  A lot of platitudes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=3.56s)]
*  Very expected. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=5.04s)]
*  Great crowd reaction. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=5.92s)]
*  The conventions in general, they're all the same in that regard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  However, there's something very different going on here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=10.84s)]
*  And that is where I was going with my first question. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  The Kamala Harris, who has taken the most radical positions on energy, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=18.12s)]
*  on immigration, on law and order, on issues involving the economy [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  and America's place in the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=27.04s)]
*  And the Kamala Harris, they're trying to remake before our very eyes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=29.8s)]
*  Will they be able to pull that off? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=34.36s)]
*  Well, you know, that's why I think the speech she gave on Friday [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=38.2s)]
*  is so unbelievable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=43.28s)]
*  They want to move her to the center. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=46.8s)]
*  They want her to eat everyday food like normal people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=49.2s)]
*  They wanted to come out with platitudes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=52.88s)]
*  Fine. And that's a strategy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=54.6s)]
*  But then on Friday, she gets up and she gives the most radical economic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=57.36s)]
*  speech ever given by a candidate for president, a nominee for president, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=63.8s)]
*  a speech which has big government socialism all the way through it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=70.8s)]
*  even though only 16 percent of the country favors big government [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  socialism, a speech which offers a trillion seven hundred [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  billion dollars in additional spending, even though 80 percent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  of the American people believe that that kind of spending guarantees more inflation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=87.56s)]
*  I mean, you can't understand up here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=93.12s)]
*  What's the what's the brain that says the Friday before the convention, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=96.76s)]
*  let's go out and be absurdly radical, so radical that the New York Times [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=102.48s)]
*  and the Washington Post attacked the speech [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=107.2s)]
*  and then turn around and say, you know, we're really not that kind of person. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=110.96s)]
*  I predict that the Friday economic speech in the end will play a bigger role [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  in this campaign than her acceptance speech Thursday night, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=120.8s)]
*  and she'll never be able to get away from it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=124.6s)]
*  OK, so really, too, that that was a first policy speech. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  There's nothing on our website that describes what her views are, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=131.0s)]
*  policies are, what she's campaigning on, which in and of itself is extremely odd. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=134.2s)]
*  But she did make one other decision, and that was her choice for V.P. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=138.96s)]
*  And she picked the Bernie Sanders of governors. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=143.32s)]
*  I mean, you have a governor that wants legal drivers licenses for illegals [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=145.96s)]
*  like Kamala supports free health care, free housing, education, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=151.12s)]
*  and even a college education. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's a guy that wouldn't lift a finger as Minneapolis was burning to the ground. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=157.72s)]
*  And and literally his family opened up the windows to their home [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  so they could smell burning rubber during the rioting in the summer of 2020. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=167.56s)]
*  Did nothing to really stop it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  And on energy, they're both against fracking and drilling. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=173.72s)]
*  I mean, huge in terms of the economy and both big supporters of the Green New Deal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=177.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris co-sponsored the Green New Deal in the US Senate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=182.32s)]
*  She supports sponsored [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=185.76s)]
*  Medicare for all along with Bernie Sanders on both bills [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=188.24s)]
*  that would eliminate private health insurance. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=191.2s)]
*  The one last point John McLaughlin pointed out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=193.28s)]
*  Most Americans are unaware of all of these radical positions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=196.76s)]
*  We're not going to hear any of them this week. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=201.0s)]
*  So that's a challenge, is it not, for the Trump campaign? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=203.48s)]
*  Well, it's only a challenge if they go to sleep and forget they're in an election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=209.12s)]
*  Look, this is the easiest campaign since Michael Dukakis [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=213.2s)]
*  was 17 points ahead in 1988 at the end of the Democratic Convention. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  And then as people learned how radical he was, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=222.76s)]
*  he just melted every week and ended up losing by eight points. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  One in a very four Americans switched their vote in 1988 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=229.76s)]
*  from Dukakis to George H.W. Bush. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=233.92s)]
*  So just one one factoid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=236.28s)]
*  Waltz and Congressman Comer, to his credit, is beyond to pick this up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=238.88s)]
*  Waltz took over 30 student groups to communist China, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=242.76s)]
*  mostly paid for by the Chinese government, communist government. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=247.88s)]
*  Now, to what degree is Waltz's collectivism [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=251.84s)]
*  and, as one person described it, his Maoist tendencies? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=255.88s)]
*  To what extent was he going to China because they were paying for it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=259.44s)]
*  And to what extent was he going to China because he really is that radical [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=263.84s)]
*  and that far to the left? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=267.96s)]
*  And if you look at how anti Catholic he was during covid, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=269.2s)]
*  how much he tightened down the state, but by the way, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=274.32s)]
*  allowed all of the Americas to keep selling. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  They they described it as retail therapy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a guy who's very scary and very dangerous. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=284.12s)]
*  He's actually to the left of Kamala, which you wouldn't think is easy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=287.72s)]
*  And I think she picked him, frankly, because the governor of Pennsylvania [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=292.56s)]
*  is Jewish and she just couldn't put Shapiro on the ticket, given [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=295.8s)]
*  what's happening outside the convention hall. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=300.2s)]
*  Let me add a couple of other things. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=302.48s)]
*  No restrictions, either one of them on abortion, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=304.12s)]
*  feminine products and boys bathrooms in school, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  gender, quote, affirming care without parental notification or consent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  California, Minnesota. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=317.68s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't seem in sync with the values in the middle of the country [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=319.72s)]
*  and the sun belt in the Midwest, where this this election is likely [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  going to be fought. Last word. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=327.52s)]
*  Well, I think when people learn that Walsh was governor, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  at least eight babies died on the table without any medical care [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=333.88s)]
*  because he is so radical that he believes not only an abortion on the last day, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=338.32s)]
*  but he believes you should allow babies to die if the parents decide [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=342.52s)]
*  they don't want them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=345.72s)]
*  This guy is literally to the left of Harris and Harris [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=347.12s)]
*  is to the left of Sanders, Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Speaker Gingrich. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=353.64s)]
*  We love having a Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYY2RPp0-E&t=355.2s)]
