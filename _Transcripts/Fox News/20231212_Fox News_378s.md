# Dr. Phil: Harvard's president is a 'symptom' of the problem
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc)
*  Much of the academic decay at American universities stems, you know, from its cult-like adherence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=0.0s)]
*  to this binary system of oppressed versus oppressor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=6.48s)]
*  And it is the very foundation of communism, and it is what your kids are being indoctrinated [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=10.92s)]
*  into at many American universities. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=16.68s)]
*  Joining us now with analysis is the author of the upcoming book, We've Got Issues, How [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=19.36s)]
*  You Can Stand Strong for Our Country's Soul and Sanity, the host of the brand new show, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=24.48s)]
*  Dr. Phil Primetime, the one and only, our good friend Dr. Phil. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=30.28s)]
*  You know what it always defines? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=34.24s)]
*  I look at you, and what has always defined you to me is your willingness to just say [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=36.24s)]
*  it as it is and not worry about consequences. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=41.44s)]
*  Here you're talking about genocide of Jews. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=45.04s)]
*  And then, of course, we want to back off, but we apply one standard to different identity [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=48.88s)]
*  groups, but not to the Jewish people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=53.56s)]
*  Why at Harvard and these other schools? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=55.64s)]
*  You know, Sean, it's really disgusting, and it's so hypocritical to hear Harvard talking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=59.24s)]
*  about, well, it's free speech. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=65.84s)]
*  They wouldn't know free speech if it came up and bit them in the ass, because this is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=68.28s)]
*  something that, as you pointed out, FIRE puts them 248 out of 248. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  They had to set up an entire new category for them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=79.36s)]
*  They were so abysmal at it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  And it's not, they don't do free speech. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=83.66s)]
*  They do their speech. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=85.66s)]
*  And as I've had people on my show, Dr. Carol Hooven, who you alluded to a few minutes ago, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=87.58s)]
*  that just went out and reported the science, just reported the science, and she was labeled [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=93.42s)]
*  as hate speech and drummed out of the university after 20 plus years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  But yet you can talk about genocide of Jews. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=104.66s)]
*  You know, genocide is an interesting term. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=108.66s)]
*  It doesn't sound real bad if you say it real fast, but the definition of it is to kill [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=110.5s)]
*  a large number of an ethnic group with the purpose of wiping them off the face of the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  earth and destroying their nation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=123.78s)]
*  But there are even exceptions to free speech. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=125.66s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=128.82s)]
*  I don't mean to brag, but I'm not. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=129.82s)]
*  But there are exceptions to free speech. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=131.9s)]
*  You cannot incite people to violence, which they're doing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=134.18s)]
*  You cannot target someone with specific threats, which they're doing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=137.38s)]
*  But still, we're not talking about speech here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=142.38s)]
*  We're talking about actions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=144.38s)]
*  They're blocking, impeding people's path to their classes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=146.34s)]
*  They're going in and disrupting their classes, going into the library and intimidating these [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=151.18s)]
*  students. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  And they're saying, oh, well, that just doesn't violate our policies. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=157.26s)]
*  That's insane, Sean. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=160.78s)]
*  You know it and I know it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  And so does anybody with common sense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=163.5s)]
*  This is a double standard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=165.64s)]
*  And it's and you know, Carolyn Gay is just a she's a symptom of the problem as well as [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=167.48s)]
*  a perpetrator of the problem. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=173.55999999999997s)]
*  This cuts really deep into these Ivy League universities. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, there's an interesting editorial in the New York Post yesterday, one down and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=178.88s)]
*  hundreds to go, that it's not just MIT and UPenn and Harvard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=183.2s)]
*  This is now institutionalized, but it's institutionalized in lower grades as well, Dr. Phil. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=188.32s)]
*  I don't know why all of a sudden we've gotten to a point where where educators for kids [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=194.44s)]
*  from in grammar school, even in high school, that they feel that their values are superior [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=201.08s)]
*  to parental values. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=206.28s)]
*  And they feel at liberty to indoctrinate these children into their way of thinking rather [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=207.8s)]
*  than sticking to the basics, reading, writing, math, science, history and computers. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=213.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=218.28s)]
*  Call me old fashioned, Dr. Phil. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=219.28s)]
*  I prefer they educate our kids, not indoctrinate them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=220.96s)]
*  Well, Sean, over 30 percent of our fifth graders and eighth graders cannot read at the most [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=225.92s)]
*  basic level. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=232.04s)]
*  Nineteen percent of our high school graduates can't read. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=233.04s)]
*  They're getting passed so the schools can get paid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=236.2s)]
*  And yet they're wanting to talk about other things. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=239.64s)]
*  And that is completely absurd. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=242.52s)]
*  And what's happening here and it's happening from the primary grades up through college [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=244.56s)]
*  is you're right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=248.84s)]
*  They're running their own woke agendas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=249.84s)]
*  And that is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=252.28s)]
*  And these people that are counseling these students on these issues, whether they're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  psychological or medical, don't have training in psychology. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=259.12s)]
*  They don't have training in medicine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=262.92s)]
*  They don't have training in sociology. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=264.8s)]
*  So they're not trained in any of the disciplines that would qualify them to counsel these students [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=267.24s)]
*  on these issues. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=273.32s)]
*  And they're excluding the parents. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=274.76s)]
*  They've known these kids sometimes for two or three weeks and they exclude the parents [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=276.52s)]
*  completely and they don't have the training to do this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=280.96s)]
*  They need to stick to what they're trained to do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=283.96s)]
*  And most of the and most of the teachers, Sean, would prefer to do that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=287.2s)]
*  This is getting jammed down their throats, just like it is everybody else. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=292.24s)]
*  The teachers are not the problem. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=296.32s)]
*  It's the policymakers and the teachers unions that are creating the problems. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=298.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  Quick last question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm glad you're coming back on TV. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  Where can people find your new show? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=305.72s)]
*  Well, it's Merritt Street Media and we're going to be launching at the end of February [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=309.72s)]
*  and I'm going to be asking you to be part of this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=314.76s)]
*  You and I have been friends for a long time and we've got an awful lot of common thoughts [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  and I'm sure we'll be crossing paths as we go along here, Sean. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=323.16s)]
*  And I appreciate you letting me speak on this today. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=327.12s)]
*  You got to aim higher if I'm on the list in the beginning. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=330.12s)]
*  You got to go a little bit higher. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=332.56s)]
*  I'm sure you can get better people, but we're glad to have you back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=333.64s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=336.72s)]
*  We appreciate you, Dr. Phil. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=337.72s)]
*  You're a good man, sir. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=339.6s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=340.6s)]
*  All right. Appreciate it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=342.08s)]
*  Coming up, is Biden turning his back on Israel? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=343.08s)]
*  You're not going to believe what he told Prime Minister Netanyahu, plus the FBI warning of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=345.68s)]
*  a heightened threat to public safety this holiday season. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=350.48s)]
*  I wonder if Joe's eight million unvetted illegal immigrants might possibly be part of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=354.4s)]
*  that cause. Straight ahead. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoaBol5aNOc&t=360.48s)]
