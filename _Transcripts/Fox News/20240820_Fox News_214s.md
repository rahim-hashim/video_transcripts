# Confrontation breaks out between protesters and police at the DNC
**Fox News:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY)
*  We go back to Mike Tobin. He's been on the streets of Chicago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, we just did see and carry Bernie Sanders wrapping up, but let's go back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=3.4s)]
*  Mike, we did see somebody just get arrested live, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=8.4s)]
*  but we also showed part of that confrontation earlier tonight that you happen to witness. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=13.0s)]
*  We'll re-rack that and show our audience again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=18.2s)]
*  You felt it was contrived, seemingly planned. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=21.6s)]
*  What is the status of things now as the protesters have been told to go home? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, as far as that arrest you saw, what you didn't see on camera is that guy tagged one of the police vehicles. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=30.2s)]
*  He put a big black A for anarchy on the hood of one of the police vehicles, and that's why the police nabbed him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=36.6s)]
*  What you're looking at right now, this is kind of repeating itself. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=43.2s)]
*  This is an unplanned march. The demonstrators just took off marching around the streets of Chicago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=46.4s)]
*  We're kind of in the West Loop area. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=51.8s)]
*  And what we're seeing with the police is they're blocking traffic to make sure these kids don't get run over. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=53.6s)]
*  We're at a point now where you've got the riot cops who have lined up and they're saying you're not going to go any further. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=59.6s)]
*  They've done that a couple of times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=64.7s)]
*  The protesters start to chant, let us through, let us through. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  And thus far, we've seen the police let them through. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=69.2s)]
*  We got to this particular intersection at Clinton and Adams Street. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=72.3s)]
*  And right now they're not moving. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  Police have lined up. They're stopping. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  It looks like there's a white shirt in there talking with whosoever at the front of the pack. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  There does seem to be a few leaders within this protest group. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=85.2s)]
*  And right now they're talking with them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=88.8s)]
*  Obviously, you can see the hands waving. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=90.2s)]
*  They're demanding to get through. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=92.3s)]
*  The police have pushed us back to this point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=93.5s)]
*  So I can't really listen in to what is happening. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=95.5s)]
*  But again, this is very contrived. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=98.0s)]
*  They had a deliberate confrontation with the police earlier shortly after they formed up their demonstration that they called Make It Great Like 68, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=100.7s)]
*  Throwback to the Riots of 1968. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=109.4s)]
*  Every indication that they wanted a confrontation with police and they're doing everything they can to get it, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=112.4s)]
*  including just marching randomly around the streets and having all of these small confrontations, Sean. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=118.0s)]
*  All right. We really appreciate it. Mike Tobin, he's been out there reporting for us all night right in the middle of these protests. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=123.8s)]
*  Paul Morrow, our friend, happens to be on the ground for NYPD detective himself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=129.5s)]
*  And apparently he's on FaceTime with us and he's been watching this unfold. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=137.9s)]
*  Paul, what are you seeing there? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=142.2s)]
*  So this thing seems to be dying down a little bit, Sean. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=145.5s)]
*  I am right now at the back of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=148.5s)]
*  As you can see behind me, there's a lot of police and riot here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=150.5s)]
*  But as Mike Tobin said, a lot of this has been very performative. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=154.4s)]
*  It was a relatively small group of protesters and they did everything they could to provoke. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=157.6s)]
*  Ultimately, the Chicago PD decided that it was time to ask them to disperse because they were blocking an intersection. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=162.2s)]
*  And they've just started walking around this area looking for a confrontation, trying to play it up to the media. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  But really, aside from a couple of arrests and a few flare ups, it's really just been a lot of marching, a lot of chanting. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  A lot of it is very, very vitriolic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  A lot of it is very profane, very anti-American, obviously very anti-Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=188.1s)]
*  But so far, we haven't seen any serious injury and only a handful of arrests. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  Alright, Paul, we really appreciate it. Thank you so much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQ1I2x1AxY&t=198.8s)]
