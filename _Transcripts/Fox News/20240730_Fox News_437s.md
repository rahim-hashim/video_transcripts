# Ted Cruz: This is the most cynical transaction
**Fox News:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk)
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, I know an officer was shot in your home state of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=0.0s)]
*  I understand by an illegal immigrant. Is that true, sir? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=7.0s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. It was an illegal immigrant. It was a Venezuelan who was actually set to be deported. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=11.0s)]
*  And then a judge delayed the deportation. And he went out with a rifle and shot a San Antonio police officer. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=18.0s)]
*  And this is happening, you know, I appreciate it. I always enjoy your monologue, Sean. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=24.0s)]
*  But tonight was powerful. It's important to go through the victims because this is something I said in Milwaukee at the convention. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=28.0s)]
*  It is every damn day, every day someone is being shot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=36.0s)]
*  Every day a woman is being raped. Every day a child is being assaulted by illegal immigrants that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have released. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=42.0s)]
*  And every one of our families are at greater jeopardy because they keep releasing violent criminals into our communities. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=52.0s)]
*  I've talked to Lake and Riley's family. I've talked to Jocelyn Nungary's family. As you know, they were on this program. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=59.0s)]
*  I talked to her grandfather too and her mother. I've talked to Rachel Moran's family, the mother of five. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=66.0s)]
*  These families are never going to be the same. What's so infuriating about this, Senator, well, there are a couple of things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=72.0s)]
*  All of it's preventable. Nobody in the media seems to care. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=79.0s)]
*  The people that, you know, will take one murder, one case and run with it and every life matters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=83.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, if it's the summer of 2020 and she's tweeting out a bail fund, that doesn't matter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=91.0s)]
*  A bail fund that lets out murderers or, you know, the summer of 2020 riots. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=96.0s)]
*  All of this, all these deaths by illegal immigrants they've allowed in the country, we don't hear about their names. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=102.0s)]
*  We don't meet their families. We don't hear about their lives. Why? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=109.0s)]
*  Look, you're exactly right. I've been with Jocelyn Nungary's mom, with her grandfather, her mom Alexis, her grandfather Kelvin. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=116.0s)]
*  The pain, the agony, you and I are both fathers. There's nothing worse on earth than to lose a child, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=126.0s)]
*  except maybe to lose a child in these circumstances where you know the horrors of your daughter's last moment on earth. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=132.0s)]
*  And these are happening day after day after day. And I'm going to say something that sounds harsh, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=139.0s)]
*  but Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, my opponent Colin Allred, they do not care. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=146.0s)]
*  Now, why do I say that? Because if they cared, they would change the policies that are making this happen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=153.0s)]
*  They would stop today releasing another illegal who's going to kill someone tomorrow. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=160.0s)]
*  And they keep doing it day after day after day. So when someone is killed, when a child is assaulted, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=165.0s)]
*  they say, oh, oh, I care. I'm so sorry about it. But no, they don't. If they keep recreating the problem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=170.0s)]
*  And Sean, the only reason they will not change it. Listen, we've had 11 and a half million illegal immigrants enter under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=179.0s)]
*  Kamala wants that 11 and a half million to be 20 million, to be 30 million, to be 40 million, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=187.0s)]
*  because she looks at them as future Democrat voters. And it is the most cynical transaction. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=192.0s)]
*  They want votes and they want power. And if children, if our children have to be at risk, if our family have to be at jeopardy, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=198.0s)]
*  they're willing to make that trade off. And I got to say, in terms of public safety, that and the threat of terrorism for open border, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=206.0s)]
*  I think those are the most compelling issues on the ballot in November. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=214.0s)]
*  You know, I'm going to raise your harsh and I'll say it. I've said it before. I'll say it again. And I'll say it every day until Election Day. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=218.0s)]
*  They have blood on their hands, Senator. They've allowed this to happen. They they they bear responsibility in these crimes [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=225.0s)]
*  because they they lied to us for three years. The border secure, the borders closed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=233.0s)]
*  Now, I want to ask you this question because some people I've run into people talk to people every day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=237.0s)]
*  I do a three hour radio show. As you know, we're on 750 stations. I talked to a lot of people around the country and, you know, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=243.0s)]
*  a lot of conservatives, Republicans. Oh, no, what is it? What's going to happen? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=251.0s)]
*  They got rid of the cognitive mess. Joe Kamala might be harder. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=255.0s)]
*  I contend this. If America learns the record that I just went through in this monologue, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=259.0s)]
*  there's no way in hell she would have a chance of ever being president of this country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=267.0s)]
*  Now, the media is going to protect her. Democrats are going to defend her. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=273.0s)]
*  How does the I didn't even mention that she rendered surrendered in the war on terror with with Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=278.0s)]
*  I think the answer is making sure and this is the Trump campaign's job, not mine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=286.0s)]
*  They got to make sure America knows the real story of Kamala Harris. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=291.0s)]
*  And and I don't know how they tell that story, but that's that would be their mission in my view. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=295.0s)]
*  That's how they win. Look, look, I absolutely agree. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=300.0s)]
*  Joe Biden for the last four years has been a puppet. He's barely aware of what's going on around him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=305.0s)]
*  Others, the radical left interest groups are pulling his strings. Kamala is very different. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=311.0s)]
*  She is a true believer. Look, I served in the Senate with Kamala. I know her well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=316.0s)]
*  She believes every bit of this. As you know, she was ranked by a nonpartisan tracking service as the single most liberal U.S. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=320.0s)]
*  senator in the entire body. As you just played, she considers herself a radical. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=328.0s)]
*  She believes in this and is pushing this. But we've got to make it about her extreme record. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=332.0s)]
*  And the media, the corporate media is going to spend billions of dollars doing this PR campaign where they're going to portray her as a mix of Mother Teresa and Oprah and Gandhi. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=338.0s)]
*  And they're going to do everything they can. They're also going to keep her very, very tightly scripted. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=350.0s)]
*  Like Joe Biden in the basement, she's going to read from the teleprompter. They don't want her cackling. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=354.0s)]
*  They don't want her committing gaffes. And it is dangerous. And you're right, it's incumbent on the Trump campaign. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=359.0s)]
*  It's incumbent on every one of us to focus on her record and to say, listen, the open borders that she champions. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=364.0s)]
*  Does that make your life safer? The out of control spending that's driving inflation and the war on energy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=370.0s)]
*  Does that make your family better? And look, just last week when Benjamin Netanyahu spoke before a joint session of Congress, Kamala Harris boycotted the whole thing because the radical anti-Israel extremism. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=376.0s)]
*  Whereas you just played a minute ago, she says the problem is not the enemies of America that want to kill us. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=389.0s)]
*  The problem is we need to have the courage not to say the words radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=394.0s)]
*  This is a battle for our country and we got to stand up and speak the truth. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=400.0s)]
*  All right, Senator, and your race is very important as well, too. We need you back in the Senate. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=405.0s)]
*  I know they've been spending the number one target at Chuck Schumer and we need you back in the Senate for sure. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=410.0s)]
*  We hope people support you. So go to Ted Cruz dot org, Ted Cruz dot org, Ted Cruz dot org. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=417.0s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBDBMDxVBk&t=422.0s)]
