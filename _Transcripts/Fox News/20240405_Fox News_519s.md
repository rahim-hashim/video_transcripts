# Hannity: Victor Davis Hanson's '11 ways' Biden is destroying America are spot-on
**Fox News:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A)
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity. Now for the hour, we will break down exactly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=0.0s)]
*  what is at stake in November. In 213 short days from Joe Biden's border crisis, we'll [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=5.32s)]
*  look at the weaponization of the Department of Justice and the FBI to the climate alarmist [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=12.84s)]
*  religious cult and their increasingly radical demands. But we begin with the president himself [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=18.36s)]
*  tonight. Joe Biden, well, be frank, he's the single worst president in modern history. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=25.16s)]
*  Anything that can go wrong has gone wrong, and yet he wants to be reelected. But he can't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=32.04s)]
*  even run on any accomplishment. Think in your own mind, what has he done that you could [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=37.32s)]
*  say, Joe, you did a really good job here, because I can't think of any. Now, he also [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  can't run on his personality and his charm because he's so cognitively impaired and has [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  always been, you know, that creepy Joe guy. Remember him? I don't run the videos because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=52.76s)]
*  it's that sleazy. But instead, Joe is trying to win votes with cheap political ploys, fear [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=57.8s)]
*  mongering, lying, demagoguery. And of course, he is more than willing to grease the wheels [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=64.36s)]
*  with your money. Now Axios is calling it Biden's 2024 goody bag, quote, the president's infrastructure [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=70.84s)]
*  and clean energy bills are pumping some $250 billion into Republican swing states. Now [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=78.84s)]
*  the report says that the cash will, quote, give him a chance to win voters town by town, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=86.84s)]
*  trip by trip. In other words, Joe looks like he's trying to buy votes with your money, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  all while dumping a massive amount of money into an economy already suffering from record [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  setting inflation, unprecedented debt and deficits. Now he's doing the same thing with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  younger people by defying the Supreme Court of this country and handing out billions [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=108.28s)]
*  and billions in student loan forgiveness. Maybe that will help him with, you know, younger [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=113.48s)]
*  voters that have been leaving him in droves. Now Biden always has been and remains a shady [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=118.8s)]
*  career politician. He will use every trick in the book to win an election. Now of course, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=125.04s)]
*  that does include pandering. Now, according to Joe, he was raised in the African American [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=130.82s)]
*  community by people from Puerto Rico, from Italy who were Jewish and Irish and Polish. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=136.26s)]
*  And as of yesterday, he's also now also Greek. Watch. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=143.34s)]
*  I think every Greek American in Delaware voted for me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  Some of the good ways of telling it, that's why I acquired the nickname I'm very proud [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  of. I am Joe Binobulus. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  I've spent more time in the Bethlehem church in Wilmington, Delaware than I have than most [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=163.74s)]
*  people I know, black or white, have spent in that church. Because that's why I started [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=170.78s)]
*  a civil, no, I'm serious, I started a civil rights. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  The Persian culture is amazing as a student of the Persian culture, not a practitioner, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  but a student. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=185.58s)]
*  With his predecessors, Rabbi Kraft and Rabbi Geffen, that's where I received my education. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  I probably went to shul more than many of you did. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=194.62s)]
*  I was sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home politically. My background and the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=198.5s)]
*  background of my family is Irish American. And we have a long history of, not fundamentally [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=205.7s)]
*  unlike the Palestinian people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=218.14s)]
*  And he also once bragged that his state was a slave state. In reality, Joe Biden really [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=221.33999999999997s)]
*  only is truly comfortable at his mansion in Delaware or sleeping late in his personal [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  wing at the White House or trying to drag a very heavy beach chair when he goes to the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=232.5s)]
*  beach and an occasional luxury trip mixed into all of this. But that won't stop middle [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=236.58s)]
*  class Joe from lying about his background. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=242.66s)]
*  And don't forget, Biden is also attempting to pander to Arab Americans and the Arab American [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=244.82s)]
*  community. Why? He has turned his back on Israel. He's basically stabbed them in the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=250.54s)]
*  back as they are fighting for their very survival after the worst terror attack in their history. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=257.02s)]
*  And then rather than supporting what would be commonsensical, would be a complete victory [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=262.42s)]
*  over radical Islamic terrorists. Remember, Israel's the little Satan. If they take out [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel from the river to the sea, who do you think they're coming after next? That would [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=273.42s)]
*  be us. Now, even the first lady is now openly begging for a ceasefire yet again. Now, there's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=277.42s)]
*  nothing the Bidens will not do when it comes to getting votes. Well, except actually work [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  hard and govern effectively. The White House is more of a vanity project for the Bidens [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=290.06s)]
*  and probably a big money making opportunity at the end of the rainbow for the Biden brand. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=294.9s)]
*  And meanwhile, his radical staffers, many from the Obama era, they are driving our country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=301.06s)]
*  into the ground. This week, Victor Davis Hansen, who will join us in a moment, detailed quote, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=306.86s)]
*  11 ways Biden and his handlers are hell bent on destroying America. Number one, the Biden [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=313.3s)]
*  administration wiped out our 2000 mile southern border. It effectively no longer exists. Number [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=320.58s)]
*  two, they ran up a $35 trillion debt. Another trillion dollars will be added every 100 days. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  Number three, they continuously appease America's enemies, including China and Iran, with subsidies [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  and sanctions relief. Number four, Biden has tried to divide this country along racial [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=343.22s)]
*  lines, gender lines. Democrats, do they do that every election? Republicans are racist, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=348.62s)]
*  sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, transphobic. They want dirty [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  air and water. And this week, by the way, Kamala Harris falsely claimed that the NCAA [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=358.86s)]
*  women's tournament, they weren't allowed to have brackets until 2022. Even though we now [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=365.54s)]
*  know that she and her husband filled out a bracket years prior to that. Number five, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=371.38000000000005s)]
*  the Biden administration supported the insanity of defund, dismantle, reimagine, no bail, soft [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=377.22s)]
*  on crime policies. Number six, Democrats quoted emasculated the military with their woke policies. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=384.18s)]
*  Number seven, Biden has tried to quote reinvent the justice system. Why? To indict, bankrupt, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=391.54s)]
*  convict, jail and eliminate their political opponents. Number eight, Biden is handlers. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=398.5s)]
*  They are creating a surveillance state in coordination with big tech. Remember the lead [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=404.34s)]
*  up to the 2020 election weekly meetings with the FBI? Number nine, Joe went to war with oil and gas, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=409.06s)]
*  driving up gas prices, which drove up the price of every item you buy and every store you go to. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=416.82s)]
*  But he did give Vladimir Putin a pass. He was allowed to build his gas pipelines [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=423.06s)]
*  and number 10, Biden and other Democrats labeled men as toxic and discouraged marriage in the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  nuclear family. And number 11, the left has successfully turned world-class universities [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=434.18s)]
*  into nothing more than mere indoctrination centers. Now this radical ideology, it is hurting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=440.58s)]
*  our country. It is hurting the world. He's abdicated America's role in the world stage [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=447.85999999999996s)]
*  in real time. And now many Americans are having regrets. By the way, it includes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=453.3s)]
*  Biden's biggest 2020 supporters. For example, like Dwayne the rock Johnson. Take a look at this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=460.02000000000004s)]
*  Am I happy with the state of America right now? Well, that answer is no. Do I believe we're going [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  to get better? I believe in that. I'm an optimistic guy and I believe we can get better. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  Um, the endorsement that I made, uh, years ago with Biden was one I thought was the best decision [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=475.78s)]
*  for me at that time. And I thought back then when we talk about, Hey, you know, I'm in this position, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=484.17999999999995s)]
*  where I have some influence and it's my job then I felt like that then it's my job now to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=490.5s)]
*  exercise my influence and share with this. This is who I'm going to endorse. Am I going to do that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=497.85999999999996s)]
*  again this year? That answer is no. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Ujp2TG4A&t=504.26s)]
