# Democrats have a ‘HUGE PROBLEM’: Gregg Jarrett
**Fox News:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY)
*  Predictably, Democrats and the mainstream media were outraged by today's Supreme Court [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=0.0s)]
*  ruling. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=5.4s)]
*  Their plot to convict Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., before the election, has been foiled. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who once violently threatened Supreme Court justices on the steps [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=12.72s)]
*  of the Supreme Court building, called today's decision disgraceful. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=18.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, AOC is vowing to impeach the justices. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=23.12s)]
*  And on cable news, the hysteria and fear-mongering was extreme. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  The Supreme Court is functioning, and it is basically giving a green light for criminal [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  activity in the Oval Office under certain circumstances, which I think, given the present [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=39.6s)]
*  state of our country, is very, very scary. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  The president's interactions with the Department of Justice are absolutely immune. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=47.24s)]
*  Terrifying decision. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  For all practical purposes, this is absolute immunity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=54.42s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Professor, it's indeed a frightening scenario that you're outlining there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  The president becomes a king in that circumstance, and it's just incomprehensible that the Supreme [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=65.08s)]
*  Court could come to such a judgment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=72.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court has decreed him a king, and now it's just up to voters to say, do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=74.8s)]
*  you want, there are no guardrails now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=80.44s)]
*  Second term for Trump, there are no guardrails. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=84.0s)]
*  We've been on the steady march of acceptance, a normalization of political violence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=86.84s)]
*  Now it's almost codified. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=92.44s)]
*  I guess, you know, theoretically, President Biden, acting within the scope of his official [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=93.88s)]
*  duties, could dispatch the military to take out the conservative justices on the court, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=100.72s)]
*  and he'd be immune. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=106.96s)]
*  Think so? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=107.96s)]
*  Joe Biden's really bad, terrible week is just getting worse. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=108.96s)]
*  Here now to respond, senior adviser to Donald J. Trump, Alina Haba, and Fox News legal analyst [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=115.4s)]
*  Greg Jarrett. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=121.84s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=123.16s)]
*  Greg, Chuck Schumer actually said the Supreme Court today in this immunity decision, quote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=124.64s)]
*  proved treason and insurrection. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=130.32s)]
*  A, they did no such thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  B, Donald Trump's never been charged with either one. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=134.12s)]
*  So how do we square a legal opinion upholding the Constitution, which the hysterical pun [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  entry coming from all the way up in the Democratic echelons? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=143.16s)]
*  Well, I suspect all of those people that you just cited and played clips of haven't actually [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=147.16s)]
*  read the full opinion, which is quite lengthy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=155.0s)]
*  And if they did, they couldn't comprehend it, because the exaggerated vitriol, this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=158.24s)]
*  apocalyptic doom from the left, would be comical if it weren't so pathetic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=164.12s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=169.28s)]
*  Schumer called it a sad day for democracy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=170.28s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=173.4s)]
*  Democracy functions better when there are guardrails, which the high court enunciated, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  and then he amped up the delirium by claiming, as you point out, Kellyanne, the justices [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  approved insurrection and treason, which, of course, they didn't, and forgetting that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=186.86s)]
*  Trump is charged with neither. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=191.42s)]
*  In truth, this really was a well-reasoned, common sense decision. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=193.22s)]
*  The Supreme Court did exactly as I said they would. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=197.78s)]
*  They extended civil immunity the presidents have had for 42 years to criminal culpability. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=200.48s)]
*  Same reasoning. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=207.9s)]
*  There's nothing shocking in this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=208.9s)]
*  Immunity for official acts, no immunity for unofficial acts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=210.98s)]
*  So the earth is not going to stop spinning on its axis tomorrow, despite the liberal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=215.26s)]
*  hysteria. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  They need to stop the pearl clutching. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=224.26s)]
*  And Alina Ayo said to the extent anyone listens to her anymore, the people in the South Bronx [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  didn't listen to her in last week's primary, and she tried to save Jamal Bowman, of all [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=230.5s)]
*  people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=235.94s)]
*  Today, she's talking about treason, bribery, other crimes and misdemeanors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=236.94s)]
*  She's saying she's going to impeach the Supreme Court justices because she didn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=243.62s)]
*  get her way on an immunity case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=246.5s)]
*  This seems like dangerous rhetoric, but what's the practical implication of a sitting member [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=248.7s)]
*  of Congress moving to impeach justices? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=253.06s)]
*  Well, it's not surprising, honestly, Kellyanne. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=255.82s)]
*  They're so desperate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=261.3s)]
*  They've realized after the debate, they've realized after their failing DAs and AGs that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=262.54s)]
*  are Soros-backed and backed by radical left donors, that they have no chance. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is, we have to keep fighting. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  We can't get lackadaisical, because there are people like AOC, who came from being a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  bartender who is now jumping around in the Bronx, screaming at the top of her lungs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=279.54s)]
*  Let's just remember, they scream and call Donald Trump what they are themselves. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=284.5s)]
*  This is insurrection behavior. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=289.22s)]
*  This is behavior to create fear in the American people, to believe that the Supreme Court, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=291.06s)]
*  which we have always respected—and I respect the dissent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  I respect both the majority and the dissent as an attorney, but also as an American. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=298.94s)]
*  Do I agree with it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=303.94s)]
*  No, I don't agree with the dissent. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=304.94s)]
*  But the behavior of people like AOC is the exact behavior that they would like the American [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=306.62s)]
*  people to believe, that MAGA Republicans, MAGA Americans, people that love this country, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=311.26s)]
*  that that is what we are. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=318.94s)]
*  And that is just frankly false. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=320.42s)]
*  They are calling us what they are because they don't want us to look at themselves. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=322.06s)]
*  That is why they're afraid. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=326.18s)]
*  Because if Donald Trump and when Donald Trump wins the election in November, when we show [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=327.74s)]
*  up and speak our minds and our voices, this will end in this country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=331.74s)]
*  We'll get back to the America we know, Kellyanne. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=335.74s)]
*  I think it's particularly dangerous, Greg and Alina, when you have members of one branch [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  of government, the Congress, highly critical of a Supreme Court decision that's about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=342.44s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=346.58s)]
*  It just seems a little—it just seems extra odious when I hear them pop off. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=348.08s)]
*  While we have two great legal minds here, I really want to tap into your brains and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=353.22s)]
*  ask you about any of the legal implications and considerations surrounding Joe Biden [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=356.26s)]
*  perhaps being replaced on the ticket. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  So what about the ballot access rules in some of the states? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=363.5s)]
*  Are they still available? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=366.86s)]
*  Has it closed? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=367.86s)]
*  And what is it that either of you know about how that would work? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=368.86s)]
*  Alina and then you, Greg. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=371.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=374.7s)]
*  Obviously, we know the DNC changed their rules about a year and a half ago. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a complicated situation, Kellyanne. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=379.82s)]
*  It's not a simple two-minute response. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=381.62s)]
*  I think we have to think about the implications. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  He's the presumptive nominee. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=386.7s)]
*  If he were to back out and say—or try, let's say, for the DNC to replace him, there would [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=389.14s)]
*  be a lot of implications for the Biden campaign. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=394.82s)]
*  They'd probably be lawsuits, as we saw when they tried to take President Trump off the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  ticket and failed. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=401.54s)]
*  It's not going to go down easy either way. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, I think, more importantly, politically and PR-wise, for the Democratic Party, it's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=405.3s)]
*  not a good look to go over a black female to ignore her position as VP and then try [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=409.82s)]
*  and usurp it because their candidate, frankly, can't walk or speak properly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=417.26s)]
*  I'm sure Greg could speak more to it, but I think it would be incredibly damaging. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=424.02s)]
*  I think they're also, frankly, in a lose-lose situation at the moment. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=427.42s)]
*  Greg, it is true that Kamala Harris's job protection for Joe Biden, in choosing her, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=429.98s)]
*  he chose one of three people in the whole country who could not upstage him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=434.46s)]
*  I'm not even sure of the other two, or I'll come up with it later. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  But how do you see all this playing out? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=440.38s)]
*  You know, as The Wall Street Journal said today, imagine if Biden had actually picked [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=442.38s)]
*  a competent vice president instead of checking political identity boxes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  That would have changed the equation dramatically. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=455.9s)]
*  To your question, though, there are two major problems with a replacement candidate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=458.26s)]
*  In early voting states, there are early ballot deadlines that a replacement would miss. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  That is a huge problem. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=470.24s)]
*  They'd have to go to court to get that changed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=472.96s)]
*  But the other problem is a monetary one. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=475.12s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden is sitting on a $200 million war chest of donations, but under federal [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=477.48s)]
*  campaign finance laws, he is not allowed to transfer that to a replacement candidate. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=483.72s)]
*  So, you know, you'd be starting from zero, whoever it is. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=490.24s)]
*  And I guarantee you if, you know, if he drops out, there is going to be chaos and mayhem [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=494.76s)]
*  on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=500.16s)]
*  It's going to make the mayhem out on the streets look tame by comparison. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=505.2s)]
*  They may be stuck with Joe. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgQNcQWYnY&t=510.0s)]
