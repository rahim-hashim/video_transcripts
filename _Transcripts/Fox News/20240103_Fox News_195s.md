# List of names associated with Jeffrey Epstein set to be released
**Fox News:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY)
*  All right. Any day now, hundreds of court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=0.0s)]
*  be made public. Now, the unsealed records will include more than 150 names of individuals [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=4.5s)]
*  who had ties to the convicted pedophile. Now, ABC News has reported that Bill Clinton will [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=10.06s)]
*  be identified as John Doe 36, with his name apparently mentioned more than 50 times. Clinton [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=15.24s)]
*  is one of many prominent names expected to appear in the court filings. We did reach [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=21.92s)]
*  Clinton's office for comment, and we were referred to his statement from 2019, when [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=27.06s)]
*  the former president admitted to traveling on Epstein's plane, says he never visited [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=32.58s)]
*  his infamous island, and his office notes that Clinton has not been accused of any wrongdoing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=37.62s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction, Tennessee Senator Martian Blackburn. Well, according to one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  of the victims who's writing a book, and an excerpt showing up in the Daily Mail, it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=46.84s)]
*  suggests that Bill Clinton was there. I guess time will prove that. I'm hearing last minute [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=52.38s)]
*  that there might have been a delay. One of the John Doe's, quote, claiming that the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  mention of their name may bring them physical harm. Have you heard that, Senator? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=63.74s)]
*  We have not heard that, but Sean, I would expect that that is what is happening. And [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  thank you for continuing to bring attention to this issue. You know, this is not a list [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  that anyone wants their name to be on. And there are going to be people there on this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  list that are accused of wrongdoing. There are going to be those on the list who are [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  accusing Epstein and Maxwell of wrongdoing. And there will be people that were witnesses [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=90.22s)]
*  to some of this activity, but did not report that activity. So I'm certain that Bill Clinton [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  and other people are very nervous. They don't want to be on this list. There are people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=104.94s)]
*  that are going to be ashamed that they are, and he's probably one of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=110.1s)]
*  The only one I can think of that might be on the list is Alan Dershowitz, who was an [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=114.46s)]
*  attorney. Everybody has a right to counsel. He did have charges brought up against him, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=118.05999999999999s)]
*  and he's been adamant in his denial of any wrongdoing or any knowledge of even the things [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=122.58s)]
*  that have happened there. Why is this important to get out to the public, in your view? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=127.82s)]
*  You know, it is so important that we figure out what happened with this sex trafficking [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=133.1s)]
*  ring, this human trafficking ring. You've been talking about the border and the cartels [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=139.22s)]
*  and the amount of human trafficking. And Sean, we know that human trafficking and sex trafficking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  has gone from being about a $500 million a year business a few years ago to upwards of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=149.78s)]
*  $150 billion a year. This is modern-day slavery. There are women and children that need this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=156.46s)]
*  protection. This is not about celebrity. It's about criminal activity. It's getting to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=164.1s)]
*  the bottom of what is going on and seeing who was affiliated and associated with Jeffrey [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=169.14s)]
*  Epstein. So we break these sex trafficking rings. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=176.18s)]
*  All right, Senator, we'll stay on it. I promise. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHKmrr7RIY&t=179.54s)]
