# Hannity: This was another free pass for Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I)
*  Now to an explosive hearing that was on Capitol Hill all day today, another blatant example [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=0.0s)]
*  of America's two-tiered, unequal justice system. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=6.28s)]
*  Now, the man responsible for investigating Joe Biden's rampant mishandling of classified [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=9.8s)]
*  material. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  Special counsel Robert Herd testified before the House Judiciary Committee today, and Herd [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  told lawmakers that Joe Biden willfully retained top-secret classified material as a private [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=21.02s)]
*  citizen and shared such material with others. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=27.44s)]
*  And by the way, not people that had security clearances. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=31.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=34.24s)]
*  My team and I conducted a thorough independent investigation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=35.56s)]
*  We identified evidence that the president willfully retained classified materials after [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=40.08s)]
*  the end of his vice presidency when he was a private citizen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=44.52s)]
*  This evidence included an audio recorded conversation during which Mr. Biden told his ghostwriter [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=48.6s)]
*  that he had, quote, just found all the classified stuff downstairs, end quote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=54.6s)]
*  When Mr. Biden said this, he was a private citizen speaking to his ghostwriter in his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=60.32s)]
*  private rental home in Virginia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=64.42s)]
*  We also identified other recorded conversations during which Mr. Biden read classified information [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=67.88s)]
*  aloud to his ghostwriter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that seems like a pretty obvious crime, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  If you did it, if I did it, if Donald Trump willfully retained classified material and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=79.16s)]
*  bragged about it to a ghostwriter, hey, I just found more classified documents in my [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=85.8s)]
*  basement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=90.72s)]
*  Let me read them to you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=91.72s)]
*  The writer, the ghostwriter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=92.96s)]
*  Well, we'd all be charged with multiple felonies, not Joe Biden. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=94.8s)]
*  In fact, before Biden's DOJ filed charges against former President Trump over classified [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=98.96s)]
*  material allegations, his home was raided by the FBI, even though he had previously [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=104.6s)]
*  been cooperating with the FBI and authorities. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=110.0s)]
*  Remember, he invited federal officials into his home and even secured. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=112.6s)]
*  They had an opportunity to be in the room where the documents were. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  They called a couple of days later. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=121.08s)]
*  Can you please put another lock on that door? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=122.44s)]
*  And of course, at the request of the FBI, they complied. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=125.08s)]
*  In contrast, Biden was never subjected to any pre-dawn raid at any of the numerous locations [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=128.32s)]
*  and there were a lot where he illicitly stored material. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=134.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=138.18s)]
*  Mr. Herr, classified documents were found at the Penn-Biden Center? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=139.18s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=143.28s)]
*  They were found in President Biden's garage? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=144.28s)]
*  In Wilmington, Delaware, yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=146.52s)]
*  And in his basement den? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=148.0s)]
*  Also in the same home, yes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=150.1s)]
*  In the mage, in his main floor office? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=151.1s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=153.6s)]
*  And his third floor den? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=154.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=156.08s)]
*  At the University of Delaware? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=157.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  And at the Biden Institute? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=161.12s)]
*  Well, that sounds like eight separate locations. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=162.68s)]
*  And as Jonathan Turley rightly points out, Herr confirmed, quote, that some of these documents [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=165.0s)]
*  reportedly came from what is known as a secure skiff. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=171.12s)]
*  Well, that would likely require Joe Biden himself to remove them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=174.56s)]
*  Does that not prove intent? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=179.32s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=181.12s)]
*  In other words, this was ultra-classified material that Biden removed from a secure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=182.12s)]
*  location, but of course Herr decided not to charge Joe Biden. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=186.76s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=190.6s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=191.6s)]
*  Now, among a litany of excuses, the special counsel just didn't think he could prove [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=192.6s)]
*  the case beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=196.92s)]
*  Oh, that's a reason not to bring a case. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=199.12s)]
*  That's news to me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=201.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=202.72s)]
*  We did not, however, identify evidence that rose to the level of proof beyond a reasonable [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=203.88s)]
*  doubt. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=208.32s)]
*  Because the evidence fell short of that standard, I declined to recommend criminal charges [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  against Mr. Biden. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=214.04s)]
*  He's a nice old man, and he'd come across as forgetful, and the jury would probably [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=217.16s)]
*  like him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=221.84s)]
*  One of Herr's chief concerns was the issue of Joe Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=222.84s)]
*  Let's look at this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=226.88s)]
*  I had to consider the president's memory and overall mental state and how a jury likely [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=227.88s)]
*  would perceive his memory and mental state in a criminal trial. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=233.3s)]
*  These are the types of issues that prosecutors analyze every day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=237.66s)]
*  And because these issues were important to my ultimate decision, I had to include a discussion [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=242.3s)]
*  of them in my report to the attorney general. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=250.44s)]
*  So we have a president who is not mentally competent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=256.88s)]
*  It basically is what he's saying to stand trial. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=259.3s)]
*  So we will only charge his opponent who is mentally competent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=262.1s)]
*  That's the argument you're going to make. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  According to the transcript from Joe's interview with the special counsel, well, the president [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=268.1s)]
*  had a very difficult time communicating or remembering simple, basic fundamental facts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=271.84s)]
*  At one point, Biden asked, quote, When did I announce for president? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=277.92s)]
*  He also asked, quote, If it was 2013, when did I stop being vice president? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=282.52s)]
*  And quote, In 2009, am I still the vice president? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=288.38s)]
*  He then asked, quote, Well, Trump gets elected in November of 2017. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=292.68s)]
*  No. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=296.96s)]
*  Anyway, Biden also could not remember the words fax machine, not once, but twice. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  And could not remember when his son passed away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=303.38s)]
*  How sad is that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  It turns out Biden's allegation against her, you know, how dare he ask his about his son. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=314.74s)]
*  It was Joe Biden himself that brought up the issue of his son. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=315.74s)]
*  But keep in mind, despite all of this, Joe Biden is the president of the United States [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=319.32s)]
*  running for another term. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Both Joe Biden and the Democratic Party swear that Biden is more than capable of serving [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  in the toughest job in the world. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  So surely he should be capable of standing trial. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  And don't forget, the special counsel discovered what was a trove of top secret documents and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=336.64s)]
*  at least seven unsecured locations that Biden took from secure government facilities dating [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=341.84s)]
*  back to his time as a senator. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=350.64s)]
*  He didn't have the ability to declassify them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=351.64s)]
*  And what impact would the Presidential Records Act have on any of this? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=354.58s)]
*  Biden then shared this classified information with at least one private individual without [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=358.42s)]
*  any security clearance. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=362.98s)]
*  His ghostwriter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=364.86s)]
*  Eight million dollars worth of reasons to have this information. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=365.86s)]
*  Here's how Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan summed it all up earlier today. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=370.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=374.94s)]
*  Joe Biden felt he was entitled. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=375.94s)]
*  You can almost hear it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=378.18s)]
*  You can feel the arrogance in the statement. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=379.54s)]
*  They're mine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=382.18s)]
*  But even with all that, Mr. Hurd chose not to bring charges. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  In your report, Joe Biden viewed his notebooks as an irreplaceable, contemporaneous record [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=387.96s)]
*  of the most important moments of his vice presidency. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=393.32s)]
*  He had written this all down. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=396.72s)]
*  For the book. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  For the eight million dollars. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  And the next thing you say in your report is, quote, such a record would buttress his [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=402.04s)]
*  legacy as a world leader. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=406.2s)]
*  You know what this is? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=408.24s)]
*  It wasn't just the money. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=410.32s)]
*  It wasn't just eight million dollars. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=411.32s)]
*  It was also his ego. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=412.94s)]
*  Pride and money is why he knowingly violated the rules. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=416.42s)]
*  And willfully. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=422.86s)]
*  Pride and money. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=423.86s)]
*  Chairman Jordan will be here with us in a moment. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=425.18s)]
*  We'll also get reaction from Chairman Comer. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=426.90000000000003s)]

*  This was another free pass for Joe Biden, despite some reprehensible conduct. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=430.66s)]
*  Now, Democrats, you would think they'd be elated. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=435.5s)]
*  Well, instead today they were furious and some were totally overcome with hysteria in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=438.24s)]
*  sense that Biden was forced to endure any scrutiny at all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=443.8s)]
*  A few Democrats even seem confused that someone other than Donald Trump was being investigated [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=448.32s)]
*  by Joe's DOJ. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=455.44s)]
*  It's not a memory test for President Biden. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=456.44s)]
*  It's a memory test for all of America. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=459.68s)]
*  Do we remember fascism? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=462.6s)]
*  Do we remember Nazism? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=464.32s)]
*  Do we remember communism and totalitarianism? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=467.21999999999997s)]

*  institutions that help seniors and not senile people. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=481.58s)]
*  I mean, I object to that comment. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  Nobody suggests he's senile. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=488.62s)]
*  And that's disrespectful of senior people with any kind of memory disability. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=489.98s)]
*  Lots of seniors have memory disability, but they're not senile. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=493.5s)]
*  And to do such, we're shameful. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=495.96s)]
*  Joe Biden is a competent, good president. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=498.92s)]
*  You are a Republican, though, aren't you? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=502.24s)]
*  I am a registered Republican. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=504.24s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=505.24s)]
*  And you're doing everything you can do to get President Trump reelected so that you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=506.24s)]
*  can get appointed as a federal judge or perhaps to another position in the Department of Justice. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=511.08s)]
*  Isn't that correct? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=516.96s)]
*  Congressman, I have no such aspirations. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=517.96s)]
*  I can assure you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=520.08s)]
*  You chose a general pejorative reference to the president. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=521.08s)]
*  You understood when you made that decision, didn't you, Mr. Herr, that you would ignite [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=525.14s)]
*  a political firestorm with that language, didn't you? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  Republicans have used the special counsel's report to further their longstanding efforts [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=532.54s)]
*  to reelect, reelect the former white supremacist in chief, Donald Trump. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=536.54s)]
*  Now, tonight, there's really just one way to hold Joe Biden accountable. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=542.4599999999999s)]
*  That is in November. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=547.54s)]
*  In November 5th, to be exact, in 237 days, you, the American people, can and frankly [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=548.54s)]

*  As of right now, the polls are not looking good for Joe Biden, even after his jacked-up [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=559.22s)]
*  performance at the State of the Union address. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=563.84s)]
*  According to a new Harris poll, Biden's approval is hovering at a record low 37 percent. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=566.42s)]
*  In a head-to-head matchup, Trump is beating him by five points. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHct_fLcN7I&t=571.92s)]
