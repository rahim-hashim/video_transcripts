# Sean Hannity: Daniel Penny stepped in as a brave Good Samaritan
**Fox News:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE)
*  But we start tonight with breaking news. Tonight, justice was served in a New York City courtroom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=0.0s)]
*  earlier today after the jury found Daniel Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=6.32s)]
*  in the subway death of Jordan Neely. Now, this comes after the manslaughter charge was dismissed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=13.36s)]
*  by the judge on Friday after the jury failed. They were deadlocked. They failed to come to a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=18.48s)]
*  unanimous decision. Now, the fact that this case was ever brought forward is a complete travesty [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=24.16s)]
*  of justice. This is someone, you know, how is this person supposed to react when you have a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=30.32s)]
*  crazed homeless person with a history a mile long in terms of dealing with cops and authorities [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=39.04s)]
*  in a subway car yelling that he's going to kill himself and everybody else in that subway car? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=45.84s)]
*  Well, that would be a clear and present danger not only to himself but everyone in the subway [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=51.76s)]
*  and everybody around him. Daniel Penny, he stepped in as a brave good Samaritan to protect [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=56.56s)]
*  everyone else in that car. As one African American woman testified to, she said, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=62.72s)]
*  thank you to Mr. Penny for what he did. The charges alone brought by the radical DA, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=69.6s)]
*  Alvin Bragg, represent the blatant weaponization and abuse of our system of justice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=77.04s)]
*  Then after the jury deadlocked, the judge went against New York state law that mandates that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  DAs choose the charges before the trial and allowed Bragg to eliminate the manslaughter [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=88.48s)]
*  charge without a verdict, which leads to what the law is intended to prevent, which is something [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=94.56s)]
*  called a compromised verdict. Now, New York courts and this DA are completely out of control. This [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=99.92s)]
*  has to end. Now, following the verdict, Black Lives Matter activists, some guy named Hawk Newsom [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=105.6s)]
*  immediately turned up the rhetoric, called for race-based retaliation. Take a listen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Just like everybody else seeks justice on their own, just like everybody else has vigilantes, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=116.96s)]
*  we need some black vigilantes. That's right. People want to jump up and choke us [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  and kill us for being loud. How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=132.96s)]
*  Black vigilantes. Let me ask this question. Where was Black Lives Matter? You see that police [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=142.64s)]
*  officer right there? A St. Louis police officer. His name, David Lee. He was killed in the line [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=148.48s)]
*  of duty back in September, a drunk driving incident by a Biden Harris illegal. Where was the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=154.24s)]
*  outrage then? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDm7jNOMWaE&t=161.68s)]
