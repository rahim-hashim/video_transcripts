# Doug Burgum on VP speculations: I’m focused on Trump winning in November
**Fox News:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A)
*  All right, speculation over Donald Trump's VP pick continues as we now inch closer to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=0.0s)]
*  the RNC and the convention. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=7.48s)]
*  And one contender is North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who is quickly gaining momentum. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=10.0s)]
*  A Trump insider telling the New York Post that Burgum is somebody who is very smart, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=14.88s)]
*  has a lot of money, not interested in public service to enrich himself, and he understands [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=20.12s)]
*  Trump on a business level. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=25.26s)]
*  And he's quiet and a steady hand, but still a sharp surrogate when needed for Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=27.44s)]
*  Again now with his first appearance, by the way, on Hannity, North Dakota Governor Doug [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=32.72s)]
*  Burgum. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=36.22s)]
*  Governor, great to have you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=37.22s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=38.92s)]
*  Do you want the job? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, Sean, first of all, great to be with you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  And I know there's a ton of interest in this process that's going on right now about the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  VP thing, but I think what's clear is that President Trump, who's winning across every [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=51.36s)]
*  demographic, can win this whole thing on himself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=54.96s)]
*  And I mean, he's winning against Hispanics, he's winning with blacks, he's winning with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  under 30. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=61.92s)]
*  The guy is so strong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=63.2s)]
*  But the real thing, which we ought to be talking about, is Joe Biden's choice for VP, because [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=64.76s)]
*  as you showed earlier in the show, with Joe, with him obviously failing right now in front [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=68.92s)]
*  of the world stage and the national stage, and then he picked four years ago someone [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=75.6s)]
*  who's got no business experience, no operating experience, between Biden and Harris, they've [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=79.68s)]
*  never created a private sector job in their life. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=84.28s)]
*  And then here we are facing a set of issues that a businessman like Trump can really take [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  care of, which is our economy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=91.24s)]
*  Trump's proven that he can take care of the border and Trump's energy policy is going to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  change the whole national security scene. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  So I think that the focus ought to be on Biden's choice. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=99.64s)]
*  And who knows if Biden's even going to make it to the starting line. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Let me go back to the beginning a little bit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=106.88s)]
*  And I'm not trying to be, I'm just trying to be consistent, be persistent in a nice way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=108.84s)]
*  If asked to be VP, what would your answer be? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=115.64s)]
*  Well, I think, Sean, I don't want to speculate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  This is a decision for President Trump and Trump alone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=121.76s)]
*  He's got a lot of great choices that he can make. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=124.68s)]
*  That's why I said if. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=126.28s)]
*  If asked, what would you say? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=127.92s)]
*  If you were asked. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=130.0s)]
*  I think again, I just want to say, you know, again, we think about the private sector and my [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=131.0s)]
*  private sector experience. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=135.56s)]
*  I mean, these are big personnel decisions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=136.72s)]
*  I have a lot of trust in President Trump making that decision. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=138.48s)]
*  But I think if there's questions about the process, those should go to the go back to the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=141.48s)]
*  Trump team. My focus right now, I had an opportunity to run again as governor for a third [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=146.12s)]
*  term in North Dakota, chose not to do that because there's been a governor under President [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=150.88s)]
*  Trump. I've been a governor under Biden under President Trump. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=154.44s)]
*  But it was like a it was like a beautiful breeze at your back. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  And under Joe Biden, for our state, a natural resources state with a big national security [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=160.56s)]
*  footprint, an agriculture state, it's like having a Gale Forest win in your face because right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=165.4s)]
*  now we're pushing back on over 30 different Biden mandates. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=170.8s)]
*  Talk about being a dictatorship. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=174.8s)]
*  That this is the this is what's happening under Biden. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=176.8s)]
*  They've got one party ideologues creating rules and mandates that are raising the price of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=179.72s)]
*  food, raising the price of gasoline. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=184.88s)]
*  You talk about that every host is on, but it starts at the point of production. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=186.52s)]
*  They're putting rules and regulation and red tape. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=190.4s)]
*  So an ag state, an energy state like ours, our oil production is down, Iran's up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=192.48s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden's energy policies, I don't know who wrote them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=197.16s)]
*  Russia, Iran, Venezuela or China, one of those four, they're the ones that are benefiting and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  it's hurting the American people. So as far as as far as my future right now, the only thing that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=204.44s)]
*  we're focused on is making sure that President Trump wins in November. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=209.0s)]
*  Do you think if you look at what the usual criteria is to pick a VP, do no harm. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  You certainly check that box. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  You've had a very successful governorship for your great state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=220.6s)]
*  You've done a great job by every measure, Governor. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=224.2s)]
*  Congratulations to you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=226.76s)]
*  North Dakota, however, is not in play. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=230.32s)]
*  Demographically, you wouldn't check a box that that people often look to when it comes to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=232.6s)]
*  choosing a VP. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=239.32s)]
*  Any argument the other way? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=241.24s)]
*  I mean, what would you be looking for if you were running for president right now? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=242.6s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump has got the he's got a golden opportunity. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=247.6s)]
*  Unlike Joe Biden, who saddled with his choice of four years ago, President Trump doesn't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=251.44s)]
*  need a VP to win. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  He can focus on someone that can help him govern, someone who can help him get stuff [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=256.8s)]
*  done. And I think he's got a lot of great choices to help him do that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=260.12s)]
*  All right, Governor, great to see you and love the state, love the people of your state. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PzfqfKTX7A&t=264.24s)]
