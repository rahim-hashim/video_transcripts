# Hannity: Biden's sit-down with Howard Stern raises eyebrows
**Fox News:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight more vile displays of hatred and extremism at far left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  protests all across the country. And meanwhile, more and more embarrassing moments for your [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  president Joe, plus Adam Schiff robbed in Northern California. Well, now making him [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  the latest California Democrat to become a victim of his party's own soft on crime policies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=19.0s)]
*  How's that Nobel defund, dismantle, reimagine the police thing working out? Not good for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  the American people at all. But we begin in New York while President Trump spends yet [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=30.04s)]
*  another day in court missing his wife, Melania's birthday. Well, Joe Biden is shuffling around [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  the city without a care in the world. Last night, attending a glitzy fundraiser, mixing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=40.72s)]
*  it up, you know, mixing up a date that is near and dear to his heart, telling the crowd, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  quote, we certainly never forget the dark days of June 6th, June 6th. Really? That Biden [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=51.16s)]
*  eventually correct himself? Anyway, he apparently did. Meanwhile, today, incredible news. Biden [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=59.92s)]
*  actually sat down for an interview, but sadly, hard hitting questions were off the table. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=65.56s)]
*  Biden joined former shock jock turn. Well, he says it himself, proudly woke Democrat [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Howard Stern on his radio show where Biden dusted off a lot of his favorite tall tales. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=76.84s)]
*  We call them lies. Now, first, he bragged about his time as a civil rights icon and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=82.84s)]
*  an arrest that actually never happened. Listen, he said, Joey, let me remember true stories. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  I remember when they were desegregating Linfield, a neighborhood into a, you know, 70 homes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=95.28s)]
*  built at one suburbia. And I told you, and there was a black family moving in and there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=101.8s)]
*  was people who were down there protesting. I told you not to go down there and you went [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  down. Remember that? And you came, you got arrested, be standing on the on the porch [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=110.96s)]
*  with a black family. Right. And they brought you back to police. And I said, yeah, I remember [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=115.76s)]
*  that. Well, first of all, the story isn't true. Howard, you're really supporting this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=120.04s)]
*  mumbling, bumbling, stumbling guy. But anyway, instead, here is the truth. As a young senator, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=125.72000000000001s)]
*  Biden worked with his mentor and of course, his friend, a segregationist and paled around [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  with racist and the former Klansman Robert KKK Bird. Why? Together, they wanted to stop [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=139.24s)]
*  the integration of public schools and busing. And he didn't want kids to go to schools. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=145.0s)]
*  In his words, they would grow up in a racial jungle. That's what Joe Biden said. That is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=151.6s)]
*  the truth. But Joe didn't stop there in this interview. Listen to this bizarre story about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=158.0s)]
*  all of the women, according to Biden, would hand him racy photographs. Take a listen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=162.88s)]
*  I got put in that 10 most eligible bachelors list. You were United States senator. You [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=169.24s)]
*  were a candidate. And so and a lot of lovely women, but women would send very salacious [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=174.0s)]
*  pictures and I just give them the secret service. Now, again, that story is likely not true. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=181.64s)]
*  You see, Biden didn't have secret service protection as a senator. And that's not all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=187.52s)]
*  At one point during the Stern interview, well, Joe Biden, well, he turned to violence openly, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=192.96s)]
*  fantasizing about a physical confrontation with Donald Trump, which he's done in the past. Listen, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=199.76s)]
*  for example, you know, I mean, Trump makes fun of me. Right. He was the kind of guy in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=205.0s)]
*  neighborhood who wish he could have gotten in the neighborhood and meet head to head. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  Wow. Go head to head. Tough guy, Joe Biden. This guy has a hard enough time with the stairs of Air [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=214.72s)]
*  Force One. He can't use the big boy stairs. You see him going up the back ramp, the little boy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  stairs. So he might want to sit this fight out. Now, of course, he will have a chance to square [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=229.36s)]
*  off against Donald Trump head to head in a debate. But remember, tough guy, Joe, he fell three times [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=236.44000000000003s)]
*  once going up the big boy stairs. And then when he got up there, his spokespeople said, Oh, it was [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=242.36s)]
*  very windy outside. I felt the wind myself. That's probably why Joe felt was tripping and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  falling all over himself. Anyway, there are typically three debates in any presidential [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  election. I'm glad this came up on the show. And he told Howard Stern that he's happy to debate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=257.32s)]
*  Trump. He just doesn't know when. Well, we'll believe it when we see it. At least one good thing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=262.44s)]
*  did come out of that interview if that debate happens. But even Biden's closest allies seem to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  think that the president is just not capable of debating Trump. Remember, he couldn't even do the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=273.08s)]
*  Super Bowl interview. It is no secret that Joe Biden is not doing well mentally or physically. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=279.4s)]
*  And I'm sure that if he does have a debate, they'll just jack him up with Red Bull or caffeine or [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  whatever he took before the State of the Union. That's when we saw jacked up, Joe. Now, clearly, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=291.0s)]
*  the White House is trying to hide what is obvious. According to a report from Axios, Biden changed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=297.32s)]
*  his walking routine from Marine One, quote, instead of walking across the South Lawn to and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  from Marine One by himself, he's now often surrounded by aides. They go on, quote, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=310.04s)]
*  with aides walking between Biden and journalists' camera position outside the White House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=315.88s)]
*  The visual effect is to draw less attention to the 81-year-old's halting and stiff gait. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=320.92s)]
*  Now, right on cue this afternoon, Biden was seen walking back from Marine One, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  surrounded by staffers who were trying to hide his every step. Our very own Jimmy Fela was on the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=332.6s)]
*  scene today at the White House covering the upcoming White House Correspondents' Dinner. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=338.44s)]
*  He'll weigh in straight ahead tonight. But just to keep track, Biden can't answer questions from [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=343.4s)]
*  reporters without his staffers telling him who to call on. He can't answer those questions without [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=348.84s)]
*  statements written down by staffers on giant notecards. He can't give a speech that wasn't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=355.32s)]
*  written by a staffer and put into a giant teleprompter with massive font by his staffers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=361.08s)]
*  And by the way, even then it's a struggle. Remember this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=368.12s)]
*  Folks, imagine what we can do next. Four more years, pause. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  Four more years, pause. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=379.8s)]
*  Four more years, pause. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=381.56s)]
*  Four more years, pause. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=383.56s)]
*  Four more years, pause. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=385.56s)]
*  Four more years, pause. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=387.56s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=389.56s)]
*  Four more years, pause. But then the White House transcript had inaudible for pause. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=390.44s)]
*  They didn't want the truth to get out. Anyway, he can't even walk without the help from his [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=396.76s)]
*  trusty staff. Why even have a president if he's incapable of doing anything? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Look at Gallup's numbers. Biden's approval rating now at a historic low, 38%. We showed you swing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=408.2s)]
*  state numbers last night, Trump winning six out of seven. Now, it could go even lower in the case [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  of Joe Biden if the disruptive anti-American, anti-Israel protests continue to disrupt colleges [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=421.16s)]
*  and cities nationwide and he refuses to deal with it. At George Washington University, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=427.88000000000005s)]
*  in our nation's capital, one so-called protester carrying a sign echoing Adolf Hitler's final [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=433.64000000000004s)]
*  solution. That's how Nazis refer to the Holocaust. And what does death to Israel and death to America [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=441.24s)]
*  mean anyway? And back in New York, a Columbia University protest leader now expressing regret [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=447.88s)]
*  after getting caught calling for the murder of Zionists. That means, oh, let's kill the Jews. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=454.04s)]
*  Again, when people tell you who they are and what they plan to do, believe them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJn01OMfeQ&t=459.8s)]
