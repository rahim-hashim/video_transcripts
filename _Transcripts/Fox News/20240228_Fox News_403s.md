# Hunter Biden will have this 'disjointed' position: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA)
*  All right, tomorrow's the day many have been waiting for. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden will appear before the House impeachment inquiry investigators for a closed-door [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=4.16s)]
*  deposition. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=8.56s)]
*  This comes months after he defied that congressional subpoena and said he would only testify in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=9.9s)]
*  a public setting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=14.68s)]
*  However, after intense negotiations and, of course, the threat of charges of contempt [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=15.84s)]
*  being brought against him, well, Hunter has finally agreed to show up and answer some [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=20.96s)]
*  questions or maybe not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=24.72s)]
*  But I guess there's always a chance he could plead the fifth to everything. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=26.88s)]
*  And I have no idea why the committee agreed to not videotape the deposition, which is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=30.56s)]
*  their normal practice. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=35.32s)]
*  And meanwhile, it was a contentious day in a Fulton County, Georgia courtroom, where [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=37.0s)]
*  Terrence Bradley, the former divorce attorney and the law partner of Nathan Wade, took the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=41.48s)]
*  stand again, facing questions about what he knows about the timeline of Fannie Willis [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=46.2s)]
*  and Nathan Wade's relationship. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Bradley wasn't willing to share that much. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  And as that Trump case appears in danger of falling apart, well, up in the—up in New [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=55.8s)]
*  York state, the Trump-hating attorney general, Letitia James, seems to be taunting President [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=61.28s)]
*  Trump by repeatedly posting how much he owes in the civil fraud judgment. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=66.44s)]
*  Here was the reaction to all this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=71.84s)]
*  Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=73.08s)]
*  You know, Steve Bannon, as far as I know, he did not get a second chance to ask for a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  new subpoena, nor did Peter Navarro. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=79.8s)]
*  And why did they accommodate that? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=84.36s)]
*  And why did they accommodate the request not to videotape the deposition? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=86.48s)]
*  I don't think there was any need to offer any concessions to Hunter Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=90.92s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, they have been accommodating to a degree that some people have questioned why. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=96.36s)]
*  He was in flagrant violation and contempt of Congress. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=102.12s)]
*  And they could have proceeded along those lines. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=107.48s)]
*  I think part of the reason that they were accommodating is that this is a target-rich [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=109.28s)]
*  environment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=113.56s)]
*  There's virtually no answer that Hunter can give to some of these questions, I think, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=114.56s)]
*  that would extricate him from the situation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=119.72s)]
*  I mean, he's going to have this disjointed position where he's going to insist that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=122.28s)]
*  he wasn't just selling his father's name, that he was this globetrotting business genius. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, when he gets into trouble, he's likely to go back to that argument [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=133.92s)]
*  that, well, during that period, I was effectively a blacked-out junkie. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=138.44s)]
*  I was addicted to drugs, and I can't remember much of it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=142.76s)]
*  Those two narratives collide, because in one week, he has to cite his addiction. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=148.84s)]
*  The next week, he has to claim that he was a draw for millions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=156.2s)]
*  But there's also some issues that I don't even have an idea how he's going to get out [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=160.28s)]
*  of it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=165.64s)]
*  For example, sending a message to a businessman in China saying, my dad's sitting right next [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=166.64s)]
*  to me, send me money effectively, or he's not going to like it, I expect he's going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=171.92s)]
*  to deny that his father was there, maybe even deny even remembering that message and blame [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=177.32s)]
*  it on his addiction. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=182.24s)]
*  But then he's got a lot other things he has to be able to address. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=184.48s)]
*  So I think that the House committees just took the view that if he's not going to take [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=189.24s)]
*  the fifth, this is going to be a long and hard road to hoe for this witness. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=193.6s)]
*  And you rightly pointed out in a really thoughtful article, I thought, that one liar does not [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=200.6s)]
*  negate the fact that Joe Biden lied repeatedly about never speaking to his son, brother or [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=205.04s)]
*  anybody about their foreign business deals. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=210.4s)]
*  Devin Archer blew that out of the water with his testimony before the committees. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=213.44s)]
*  It doesn't negate the massive amount, the tens of millions of dollars that the Biden [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  family took in from these companies. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=223.84s)]
*  It doesn't negate what you refer to, the WhatsApp message. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=226.22s)]
*  And days after that message, millions of dollars made its way into one of these, quote, LLC, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=229.98s)]
*  or as James Comer calls them, shell corporations that the Bidens have. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=237.17999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't negate the fact that 10 Biden family members have been identified as being [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=242.98s)]
*  paid with millions of dollars. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=247.0s)]
*  It doesn't negate the fact that services—no services appear to be rendered in any one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  of these cases. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=255.66s)]
*  What did they do for this money? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=257.02s)]
*  What did the grandchildren do for this money? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=258.34s)]
*  How did Hunter, addicted to drugs with no experience in energy, make money from the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=261.14s)]
*  Ukrainian energy giant Burisma and the Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=266.52s)]
*  The one lying FBI informant that they swore was trustworthy, well, that doesn't negate [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=273.82s)]
*  any of that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=278.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=281.5s)]
*  And the point that you began with is going to be something I expect will come up early. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=282.94s)]
*  Hunter Biden himself contradicted his father's denial of having no knowledge of his business [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=288.14s)]
*  dealings. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=293.14s)]
*  And I expect they're going to press him on that point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=294.14s)]
*  There's that famous call after his—after a dinner where he was prompted, according [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  to a close associate, to make a call to Washington. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=303.02s)]
*  Who was on that call? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=306.58s)]
*  Why was it made? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=307.74s)]
*  Those are questions that he can expect, and we have no idea what his answers may be. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=309.18s)]
*  But I think that there's no way that he can support his father's claim, which I think [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=315.18s)]
*  is now thoroughly debunked, that he had no knowledge of these dealings. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=319.66s)]
*  What is clear here is that this was influence-peddling raw and massive. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=324.82s)]
*  And it's also clear that his father knew this was happening. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=329.68s)]
*  It was in the newspapers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=332.82s)]
*  His father had to have been told about this, prepped for it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=334.6s)]
*  So his denial is in shatters, just in pieces right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=338.18s)]
*  And his son's going to be pressed on that point. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=343.72s)]
*  Let me ask you quickly—we don't have a lot of time—your reaction to the hearings [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=346.98s)]
*  on Fonny Wallace today. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=352.58s)]
*  I mean, it was a painful testimony to watch. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=353.58s)]
*  It came off as sort of a Sergeant Schultz defense that I know nothing, nothing, including [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=357.06s)]
*  stuff that I knew with clarity just recently. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=362.3s)]
*  And it did not go over well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=365.42s)]
*  Is that case over in your view? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=368.08s)]
*  Well, I can't imagine why these two prosecutors have not removed themselves, because I think [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=370.68s)]
*  this judge is in a tough position to keep both of them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=376.84s)]
*  There's a chance that they both could be disqualified. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=380.56s)]
*  They have not helped themselves, and they certainly have not helped the people of that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=383.36s)]
*  state. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=387.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=388.52s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, as always, thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBV9MgtSTrA&t=389.52s)]
