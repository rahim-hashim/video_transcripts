# Trump will ‘fix’ this: Gov. Glenn Youngkin
**Fox News:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo)
*  Glenn Youngkin is with us. Governor, this can't keep happening. I'm going to scroll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=0.0s)]
*  the names of Americans murdered and victims of rape and violent crime by [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Harris, Biden, illegals, on top of the the known terrorists. People were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=10.88s)]
*  terrorized, but we don't know where they are. Hundreds of them they have allowed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  into our country, which I think will result in a terror attack. Your reaction [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=19.92s)]
*  to all this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=24.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's just shocking, but it's real. And just today, of course, we had yet [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=26.86s)]
*  another illegal immigrant who was arrested for abducting a girl while she [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=33.28s)]
*  was walking to school. He was pretending to be a police officer. Last week we [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  had one who was chaining adolescent kids in their apartment to keep them [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=44.32s)]
*  from leaving. Over the summer, we had two illegal immigrants try to ram the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=49.36s)]
*  front gate at Marine Corps Base Quantico in a box truck. I mean, Sean, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=53.300000000000004s)]
*  this is unbelievable that we're even having this conversation. And yet you do [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=57.84s)]
*  have Kamala Harris, who was the border czar, who continues to advocate for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=63.56s)]
*  decriminalizing illegal immigration. That is where the nation is. Sean in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=69.0s)]
*  Virginia's Department of Corrections, there are about 950 illegal immigrants [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=74.82s)]
*  that have an open immigration detention order. And out of those 959 out of 10 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=81.08s)]
*  have been have been arrested and incarcerated for violent felonies, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=87.64s)]
*  murder, rape, assault. Sean, this is unbelievable in our country today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=94.1s)]
*  Donald Trump will fix this. And at the heart of this is a clear choice on the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=100.28s)]
*  ballot, and we will see it tomorrow night. She will try to convince America [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=105.24s)]
*  of something different than the truth. She will say that she believes in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=110.56s)]
*  things that we know aren't true. She has a track record that has gone for an [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=115.12s)]
*  entire career. And even as you showed earlier in your in your show tonight, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=119.64s)]
*  Bernie Sanders says she's only doing it in order to win the election. She is a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=124.12s)]
*  progressive liberal. And let's just remind ourselves in 2019, she was rated [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=129.12s)]
*  the most liberal senator, and that's ahead of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=135.08s)]
*  Warren. America sees who she is. She can't lie and change her positions and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  get out of it. And that's why you see the kinds of polling you saw yesterday in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=147.4s)]
*  the New York Times. Americans get it. They want strength back in the White [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=151.36s)]
*  House, not weakness. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  All of this information, all these comments, radical positions, extreme [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=157.68s)]
*  positions, frankly, dangerous for the country positions that she has made. She [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=162.38s)]
*  hasn't done a press conference. She's only done one interview for 16 minutes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=166.98s)]
*  and 29 seconds. And she the media has allowed her to get away with it. That is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=170.7s)]
*  and voting is starting now in states like North Carolina, Delaware and a week [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=178.24s)]
*  from tomorrow in Pennsylvania. I mean, it's so unfair. 11 days in Virginia, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=183.66s)]
*  Sean. 11 and and sadly, I don't think ABC will do their job tomorrow night [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=188.74s)]
*  because they've been in the tank for her the whole time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=195.22s)]
*  Well, she certainly cannot do a television interview because I think [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=199.78s)]
*  she's really concerned that the truth will come out. I mean, you've been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=203.66s)]
*  through the litany tonight. She supports the Green New Deal. She wants to ban [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=206.94s)]
*  fracking. She absolutely wants to decriminalize border crossing. She [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=211.38s)]
*  wants to get rid of the Trump tax reductions and raise taxes on American [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=215.78s)]
*  families. She's even on the record that she wants to decrease the defense [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=220.74s)]
*  budget. Let me tell you, for a state like Virginia, that is absolutely a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=224.5s)]
*  death knell to us for her to decrease the defense budget. She's on the record [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=228.58s)]
*  on all of these topics. That's why she can't do a television interview because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=232.94s)]
*  I'm sure she's afraid the truth will come out because she'll say what she [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=236.62s)]
*  believes. I do believe tomorrow night that President Trump will do what he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=239.94s)]
*  does incredibly well. He will present the answers. He will secure the border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=244.28s)]
*  He'll build a rip-roaring economy. He will make America strong on the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=249.24s)]
*  international scene, and he will reinforce safety at home. And that's what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=253.08s)]
*  Virginians and Americans want to see, and they're not going to get it from [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=258.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=261.36s)]
*  Well said. And she will duck, dodge, weave and not tell the truth. And the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=263.28s)]
*  media will proclaim... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=269.08s)]
*  She's... She uttered two... He strung two sentences together. She's amazing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=270.32s)]
*  All right, Governor, good to see you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSQNxB3yNo&t=275.03999999999996s)]
