# Texas Gov. Greg Abbott responds to Biden: 'Nothing more than gaslighting'
**Fox News:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU)
*  Here with reaction, the governor of the great state of Texas, Greg Abbott, who's had to fight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=0.0s)]
*  a lot of this battle alone. And the biggest part of your fight, governor, has been with Merrick [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=4.24s)]
*  Garland, who we're going to get to later tonight, and with Joe Biden and all the lawsuits and all [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=9.76s)]
*  the lawfare to prevent you from keeping your state and the citizens in your state safe and secure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=15.52s)]
*  Your reaction? Well, first of all, to your latter point, listen, the Biden administration can try to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=21.68s)]
*  do whatever they want to try to do. Texas is not going to back off of what we are doing to actually [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=28.64s)]
*  securing the border. We've built a border wall. We've erected hundreds of miles of razor wire [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=33.84s)]
*  barrier. And get this, the numbers are astounding. While illegal immigration has increased in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=39.68s)]
*  California, Arizona and New Mexico by about 20 percent or 25 percent, in Texas it has gone down [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=46.56s)]
*  about 74 percent because of the resistance that we've put up. But know this, what Biden announced [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=52.88s)]
*  today is nothing more than gaslighting his fellow Americans because there is nothing in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=58.64s)]
*  announcement today that actually shows any enforcement of any immigration law that denies [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=64.8s)]
*  illegal entry into the country. He talks about trying to have this asylum process and changing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=71.04s)]
*  the rules that actually will allow more people in. What Biden did today was actually entice [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=76.16s)]
*  more people to come to our border to increase illegal immigration, not to stop it. He's not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=81.84s)]
*  using any tool or strategy to deny illegal immigration. Sean, importantly, there are three [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  laws that exist that Biden is not enforcing. One is to deny illegal entry. The other is to detain [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=92.72s)]
*  illegal immigrants who do make it here. The third is to build border barriers. He's choosing not to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=100.0s)]
*  do any of that. Instead, he's had open border policies that have led to more than 10 million [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=104.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants into our country. You know, Governor, when I last saw you and I was at the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=110.08s)]
*  border with you and President Trump, I was there at Eagle's Pass. I saw the barriers that you built. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=115.2s)]
*  We went over the numbers. You told us how effective it has been. You've expanded it even out further. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=124.08s)]
*  This is at a great financial cost to the people of Texas because you're paying for all of this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=130.96s)]
*  on top of the guard that you're now deploying to the border and all without the help of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=136.64s)]
*  administration. And to add to your burden, they keep bringing you to court. Are you still facing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  lawsuits from Merrick Garland and Joe Biden and his weaponized DOJ? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  We are. So you remember those big orange buoys that we put into the Rio Grande River? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Biden and Merrick Garland, they filed a lawsuit to put a stop to it. As we're talking right now, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=159.76s)]
*  those buoys remain in the river. You remember when the Border Patrol were ordered to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=164.64s)]
*  cut the razor wire? I told the National Guard to triple the amount of razor wire. That razor wire [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  remains up. You saw Shelby Park, which is a 50-acre park in Eagle Pass, Texas, where [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  there had been 5,000 people crossing the border a day. Now there are only, on average, two people [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=181.44s)]
*  crossing the border in that area a day. And those two people who cross, they are arrested by the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Texas Department of Public Safety. Listen, I saw it for myself. I saw the magnitude of work. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=194.16s)]
*  And I have to imagine you're spending tens and tens of millions of dollars. You know, I saw you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=200.32s)]
*  build other barriers. You put containers out there. You put trucks out there. And every step of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  way, you have been stifled and stymied and stopped by the federal government. Why do you think that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=211.28s)]
*  they're doing this? Because if I went down to your border, Governor, I'm pretty confident if I picked [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=216.72s)]
*  up people at that border and I transported them to another city or state in this country, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  that probably I wouldn't get out of the state of Texas without being arrested for human trafficking. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=226.4s)]
*  Well, listen, the Biden administration is trying to use every tool they can to allow these open [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=234.16s)]
*  border policies so they can redesign the United States of America. Texas is having none of it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=239.68s)]
*  And that's why we've done things that no other state has ever done in the history of America. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  It's also why we, our action has actually led to a decrease in illegal immigration. All it takes [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=249.36s)]
*  is enforcement and deterrence. That's what Texas is doing. That's what the Biden administration [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=256.32s)]
*  is refusing to do. I'm all right. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, I appreciate the fact. It's sad that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=261.44s)]
*  you have to go it alone. It's sad that the great state of Texas has to go it alone. I know you've [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=267.6s)]
*  had support from your congressional delegation, Ted Cruz, et cetera. Thank you, Governor, for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=272.48s)]
*  your time. It's sad that this happens. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iox9RY5sKiU&t=279.12s)]
