# SCHUMER SWEATING?: AOC seen as true leader of Democratic Party in poll
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4)
*  All right, the Democratic Party, they remain leaderless, and party infighting has only [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=0.0s)]
*  intensified following Chuck Schumer's support for the Republican funding bill. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=4.24s)]
*  And NBC News is now reporting several House Democrats. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=8.82s)]
*  They are urging AOC to primary Schumer in 2028. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Starting today, the congresswoman is joining Bernie Sanders at a series of rallies in Arizona, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=16.48s)]
*  Nevada, Colorado. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=22.12s)]
*  And that's further sparking questions about her considering a run for higher office, which, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=23.82s)]
*  by the way, it may surprise you, I am highly supportive of. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=28.68s)]
*  After all, she is the true leader of the radical Democratic Party. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=32.24s)]
*  Let her hold her rightful position. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=36.12s)]
*  And according to a new CNN poll, voters believe AOC embodies the party's core values more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=38.34s)]
*  so than both Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=44.16s)]
*  Here with reaction, former Trump, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, along with the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=48.28s)]
*  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=52.44s)]
*  Look at this, the dynamic duel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=56.24s)]
*  I have no idea who to go to first. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=58.06s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=60.1s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=61.1s)]
*  You go to Jim, go to Jim. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=62.1s)]
*  Mark's older. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=63.1s)]
*  Go to the chairman. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  Mark's older. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  Go to him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  Mark's older. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  That's cold. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  All right, Mark, we'll start with you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  So AOC is the leader of the party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  Jasmine Kroc is the leader of the party. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Chuck, you know, has to now grovel to stay in power, whether or not he's successful or [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=76.86s)]
*  not, time will tell. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  I'm okay with AOC leading the party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, she represents the vast majority of that extreme left wing of the party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  But the poll that you were talking about, Sean, the interesting thing is, had Kamala [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  Harris and Bernie Sanders not been in that poll, it would have been one in four actually [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=98.5s)]
*  believes that she should lead the party. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=104.5s)]
*  So is that making Chuck Schumer sweat? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=107.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=110.14000000000001s)]
*  You can't imagine like a hot day in South Carolina, he's sweating. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=111.14000000000001s)]
*  The real problem is this is not about personalities, Sean. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=116.46s)]
*  It's about policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=119.74s)]
*  And the fact is their policies don't work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=121.28s)]
*  77 million people let their voice be heard on that particular subject back in November. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=124.7s)]
*  Jim Jordan, I'm getting very nervous now about the actions of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=131.14s)]
*  If they want to hold bingo cards, fine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=137.54s)]
*  If they don't want to stand for mothers that lost their children, okay, that's on [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=145.14s)]
*  They don't have a soul, in my view, but that's fine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=146.14s)]
*  But now that they're going into Republican districts with their talking points, trying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=148.82s)]
*  to create a hostile atmosphere, now we're talking about danger. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  Now that you have groups and even Congresswomen that are supporting going after Elon Musk the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=158.42s)]
*  way they are, like Jasmine Crockett did that we showed earlier, that is a frightening scenario. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=165.26s)]
*  No, it's scary and it's not going to help them politically. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=171.78s)]
*  When you embrace crazy, you're going to be at a 27% approval rate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=175.18s)]
*  I don't care who leads their party. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=179.06s)]
*  As long as they're embracing these crazy policies, it's going to be a win for us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=180.38s)]
*  And I think President Trump probably said it best. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=183.94s)]
*  It's common sense versus crazy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=186.5s)]
*  So go down the list. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=188.22s)]
*  It is crazy to defund the police. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=189.22s)]
*  It is crazy not to have a border. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=190.98s)]
*  It is crazy to have men compete against women in sports. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=192.74s)]
*  It's crazy to attack Teslas and burn them up, go after dealerships. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=195.5s)]
*  And maybe the one that is front and center on Americans' minds is what this judge did [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=199.54s)]
*  this past week. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=203.22s)]
*  It is crazy for an unelected federal district judge to say, turn the plane around, bring [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=204.22s)]
*  back hardened gang member criminals who are here illegally, turn them around, bring those [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=210.42s)]
*  bad guys back to America. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=215.68s)]
*  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  But that is now their party. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=219.22s)]
*  And if they want to continue to embrace the craziness, we'll keep doing the common sense [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=221.12s)]
*  Trump talks about and is getting done for the American people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=225.72s)]
*  Bill Clinton once said, famously, Mark, the era of big government is over. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=230.2s)]
*  The end of welfare is we know it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=233.88s)]
*  He made a pivot. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=235.4s)]
*  He adapted. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=236.4s)]
*  I don't see any possibility of that because I think the party is radical left. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=237.76s)]
*  Well, it is radical left and they're not pivoting. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=243.68s)]
*  In fact, they're doubling down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=246.96s)]
*  You mentioned Bernie and AOC out in Nevada today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=249.36s)]
*  What was their big call out? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=253.48s)]
*  It was on Elon Musk. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  Now here is Elon Musk, who has put more electric vehicles on American roads by an American [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=257.44s)]
*  manufacturer than anybody. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=263.44s)]
*  And yet they see him as the evil one. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=266.0s)]
*  I can tell you his hypocrisy at its highest level. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=269.2s)]
*  But I can also say this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=273.08s)]
*  Don't underestimate AOC. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  Joe Crowley did that back in 2018. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=277.8s)]
*  He was supposed to be speaker of the house and he found himself on the outside looking [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=280.84s)]
*  in. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=284.76s)]
*  And so we need, as Jim was saying, we need to continue to be the common sense party against [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=285.76s)]
*  the crazy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=291.11999999999995s)]
*  I guess climate is no longer the existential threat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=292.11999999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=296.0s)]
*  Jim Jordan? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=297.0s)]
*  I guess that's their thought. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=298.0s)]
*  Yes, because it's all about power. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=300.0s)]
*  It's all about power for the left. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=302.2s)]
*  It's not really about policy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  It's about control. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=304.96s)]
*  Take this Department of Education. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=305.96s)]
*  I mean, think about it, Sean. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=306.96s)]
*  The average salary at the Department of Education is 144,000. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=308.48s)]
*  The average teacher salary is probably 50,000, 60,000. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  Who has a bigger impact on the kid? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  The person in the classroom with them, that teacher every day, or some bureaucrat in D.C.? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  So the president is common sense policy on this issue as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Common sense beats crazy every single time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=325.44s)]
*  You give parents, 10 parents, enough money, they can hire their own teacher, they can [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  get a school, a classroom, and those kids will have attention like they've never had [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=332.04s)]
*  in their lives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Alright, the dynamic duo, we appreciate you both. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=337.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gd_yvbht4&t=339.96s)]
