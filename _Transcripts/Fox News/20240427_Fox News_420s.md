# Jordan torches NY v Trump as the former president misses wife's birthday
**Fox News:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0)
*  All right, today marked the eighth day of Trump's quote, oh my gosh, he made a bookkeeping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=0.0s)]
*  error documents trial in New York. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  And a new House Judiciary Committee report is saying, well, we've been telling you all [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=8.6s)]
*  along. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=13.24s)]
*  Radical Manhattan, DA Alvin Bragg has allowed his political motivations and his promises [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=14.24s)]
*  as a candidate to drive the prosecution of Donald Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In this report, over 300 pages, the committee highlights the fact that Bragg used a novel [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=24.32s)]
*  legal theory. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=29.92s)]
*  We've been telling you to bootstrap these allegations as a felony in New York. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=30.92s)]
*  They'd be a misdemeanor and the statute of limitations had already passed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=35.84s)]
*  Here with more chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, Mr. Chairman and Congressman, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  welcome back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=46.36s)]
*  And anatomy of a political prosecution, the Manhattan DA's office vendetta against President [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=47.44s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=53.88s)]
*  Well, usually in a report when you get to 300 plus pages, you got a lot of information. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=55.32s)]
*  Let's go through some of the fundamentals. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=61.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=64.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, Alvin Bragg bragged about it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=65.16s)]
*  I mean, bragged about the idea that he had sued President Trump or went after President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=67.92s)]
*  Trump hundreds of times when he's campaigning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=71.4s)]
*  But once he gets in office, he realizes there's no real case here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=74.08s)]
*  He realizes what the Department of Justice realized when they didn't bring the case, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=77.38s)]
*  what the Federal Elections Commission realized when they didn't bring the case, and even [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=81.0s)]
*  what his predecessor realized, Cy Vance, at the Manhattan DA when he didn't bring the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=83.86s)]
*  case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=88.34s)]
*  But he has a guy working for him who volunteered, Assistant DA Mark Pomerantz, who is pushing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=89.34s)]
*  this case, saying we got to go after Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=94.62s)]
*  He came to work for Alvin Bragg simply to go after Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=96.84s)]
*  And he's the one who persuades Alvin Bragg to do it, not while he's Assistant DA, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=100.44s)]
*  only after he resigns, throws the temper tantrum, does the media blitz, and most importantly, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=104.78s)]
*  writes a book where he lays it all out, how he was out to get the president from the get-go. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=110.7s)]
*  That's what prompted Alvin Bragg, that frankly, and Donald Trump announcing that he was going [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=116.06s)]
*  to run for president, that's what prompted Alvin Bragg to bring this ridiculous case. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=119.76s)]
*  And Pomerantz called it the zombie case because it was dead, gone, and buried, and then the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  statute of limitations passed anyway. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=129.04s)]
*  You talk about this as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=132.5s)]
*  Wouldn't you consider the third highest ranking official at Biden's DOJ to be a pretty prestigious [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  job? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=142.54s)]
*  Would you consider that to be? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=143.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=145.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=146.5s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=147.5s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=148.5s)]
*  Then why did this guy move from that job to give opening arguments and work on this case [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=149.5s)]
*  in a DA's office in the state of New York? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=154.62s)]
*  Why would you give up that big job? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Same reason Pomerantz was willing to work for free. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=161.76s)]
*  They had a vendetta, they had an agenda to go after President Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=164.38s)]
*  Colangelo from the Department of Justice goes to the DA's office to go after President Trump, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=167.94s)]
*  and Al, excuse me, Mark Pomerantz does the same thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=172.78s)]
*  It was all about getting Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=176.26s)]
*  In fact, these are the guys who said, we can put Michael Cohen as our star witness. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=177.74s)]
*  The one thing that probably bothers me most about this case right now is the fact that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=181.98s)]
*  they put a gag order on President Trump. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=186.22s)]
*  Former president, current Republican nominee for president of the United States, likely [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=188.7s)]
*  going to be our next president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=193.1s)]
*  I certainly hope he is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=194.34s)]
*  He's not allowed to talk. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=196.22s)]
*  But Michael Cohen is, you know, a convicted perjurer, a guy who came in front of Congress [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=197.54s)]
*  and lied six times in one congressional hearing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=202.26s)]
*  He's allowed to say whatever he wants, but President Trump's got a gag order by this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=205.28s)]
*  judge, this obviously partisan judge whose daughter worked for every Democrat you can [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  think of. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  This is what is so unfair. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  It's all driven by politics. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=216.98s)]
*  The whole plan here is to keep Biden in the basement because he can't talk about anything. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=218.7s)]
*  Keep Biden in the basement and Trump on trial. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  That's what the Democrats are trying to do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=225.22s)]
*  That is their whole plan because they know that President Trump's going to win if he's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=227.02s)]
*  out there and able to campaign. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=231.3s)]
*  And that's why they're trying to keep him tied up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=232.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=234.82s)]
*  So we have a Biden donor as the judge with family members, you know, an accused family [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=235.82s)]
*  financial conflict. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=242.46s)]
*  The statute of limitations on what were misdemeanors passes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=244.18s)]
*  Even Joe's weaponized DOJ, even they had passed on the federal charges that they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=248.38s)]
*  trying to use in this case, which I don't think they even legally have a right to do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=255.7s)]
*  But yet they throw in everything they've got up against the wall. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=260.7s)]
*  And it really comes down to a bookkeeping error, which would be a misdemeanor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=264.14s)]
*  In other words, they filed what was a non-disclosure agreement and labeled it as a business expense. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=268.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=275.54s)]
*  Is that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=276.54s)]
*  And meanwhile, by the way, if you beat up cops in Times Square, you get released from [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  jail and probably not charged by the same DA. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  And even if it was, yeah, and even if it was a bookkeeping error, it's a misdemeanor. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a two year statute of limitations for goodness sake. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=288.94s)]
*  But no, no, they're going to use that and somehow say it dealt with campaign finance [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  and election law. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=296.18s)]
*  And the charge is really conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=297.18s)]
*  Conspirited impact of 20. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=302.18s)]
*  And it's funny because Jack Smith, his charge is conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=303.82s)]
*  regarding the 2020 election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=308.3s)]
*  I actually think the truth is this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=310.3s)]
*  Alvin Bragg and Jack Smith are the ones who are in a conspiracy and that conspiracy is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=312.46s)]
*  to impact the 2024 presidential race. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=316.7s)]
*  That's what's going on here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=320.82s)]
*  And again, I think that I think the American people see it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=321.82s)]
*  Let me ask you, do we know in all these cases, New York, D.C., Fonny Willison in Fulton County, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=325.58s)]
*  I have not heard anything bad about Florida, but when these DAs show up at the Biden White [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=333.62s)]
*  House, do we know who they're meeting with? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  Do we know if there's collusion going on? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=342.73999999999995s)]
*  I'd like to know who they're meeting with, who they're talking to. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  Are they strategizing together? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=348.58s)]
*  Are they getting advice from or maybe they're just sharing a cup of coffee? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  Well we've subpoenaed information regarding Fonny Willis, particularly Nathan Wade, the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=356.02s)]
*  number of trips he made to D.C. when he looks like he talked with the January 6th Committee, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=359.14s)]
*  the White House Council and the Biden DOJ. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=363.62s)]
*  So we want to get all that information. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  So yeah, I think this is one big effort. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  The conspiracy, this is I think a key point. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=370.94s)]
*  Bragg says it's a conspiracy about 2016 on President Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  Jack Smith says 2020, but the real conspiracy is Bragg, Jack Smith, Fonny Willis, all these [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  Democrats conspiring to impact the 2024 race. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=383.28s)]
*  That's what's going on and again I think the American people see it plain and clear. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=387.9s)]
*  The anatomy of a political prosecution, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office vendetta [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=393.34s)]
*  against President Donald J. Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=398.67999999999995s)]
*  All 300 plus pages of it are on Hannity.com. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  Jim Jordan, thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=405.62s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpB6PylokV0&t=406.94s)]
