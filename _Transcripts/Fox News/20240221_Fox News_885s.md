# Mike Huckabee: This is absurd
**Fox News:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8)
*  wrong. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributors Lisa Booth and Charlie Hurt, also former Arkansas [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=1.0s)]
*  Governor Mike Huckabee is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=5.64s)]
*  Guys, good to see you all. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=7.12s)]
*  Lisa, let me start with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=8.48s)]
*  That's a lot to absorb. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=11.16s)]
*  I mean, we are—we're on the verge of South Carolina. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=12.16s)]
*  It's the home state for Governor Haley. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=15.96s)]
*  She seems to be getting more aggressive by the day. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=19.44s)]
*  It's gotten heated. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=22.92s)]
*  But South Carolina, frankly, is always heated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=25.16s)]
*  You can go back to George W. Bush and John McCain. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=27.2s)]
*  That was a pretty nasty race back in the day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=30.04s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=33.04s)]
*  Well, and you asked that question, where is the path? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=34.04s)]
*  There is none. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=37.84s)]
*  And she knows that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=39.2s)]
*  I mean, what does it say about Nikki Haley, about the weakness of her candidacy, that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=40.2s)]
*  she had to lie to us to get anyone to watch that press conference today? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=43.8s)]
*  She had to punk us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=49.72s)]
*  She had to dupe us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=51.0s)]
*  She had to lead people to believe that she was dropping out, to get people to watch her [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=52.04s)]
*  press conference. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  There is no path for Nikki Haley, I think. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=56.96s)]
*  And she knows that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  I think she knows that she's not going to win. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  She knows there's not going to be a path. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  I think what she wants is pats on the head from the mainstream media. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  Maybe she wants a contract at MSNBC, CNN. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  She wants to be part of the club. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=70.4s)]
*  But I do want to mention just one thing about watching the Trump town hall tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  It made me think that we don't have to live like this, Sean. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=77.56s)]
*  We can have a strong economy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=80.6s)]
*  We can have a strong border. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=82.12s)]
*  We can be respected again as a nation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=83.4s)]
*  But we need a change at that White House, and that change is Donald Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  So I hope Americans were watching and know that we don't have to live like this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=90.08s)]
*  It can be different. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  It has been, and it will be again, hopefully. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, Governor, I'm particularly—I don't know, maybe amused is the word, but [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=97.12s)]
*  I find it even bewildering for the mainstream media mob. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=103.56s)]
*  I've always viewed them as sort of an extension of all things liberal Democrat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=107.4s)]
*  And they go with all the talking points. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=112.48s)]
*  They were called in. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Some guy named Ian Sams in the special counsel's office is directing them what they should [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  be reporting on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=121.36s)]
*  They're upset that the mainstream media can no longer ignore what they tried to ignore [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=122.84s)]
*  for almost four years, and that's Joe's physical and cognitive decline. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  But they're upset in the White House that the obvious is being spoken. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=134.76s)]
*  I don't think they have any choice at this point. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=138.88s)]
*  Sean, it took a beach towel for me to dry my tears when I realized how sad they are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=142.92s)]
*  at the White House over the way the press is treating them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=148.6s)]
*  I mean, my gosh, you've turned into a New York refugee having to leave your home state [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=151.6s)]
*  because of the wonderful reception you've been given up there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  But I just think it's absurd that the White House is whining that somehow they just don't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=161.04s)]
*  think they're being treated very well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=166.64s)]
*  Well, welcome to our world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  And boy, are they ever having a hard time adjusting to just a tiny little bit of criticism. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=171.36s)]
*  Look what Donald Trump has been through for the past eight years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=177.36s)]
*  It's been absolutely the most relentless attack on him personally, legally, economically, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=180.52s)]
*  socially, in every way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  And he's still standing up and fighting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=191.28s)]
*  That's why I think a lot of Americans are coming to Donald Trump and saying, nobody [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=193.64s)]
*  else can take what he's put up with and keep getting up every morning and fighting for us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, let's get your take, Charlie. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  And I guess the horse race is in the news. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=208.2s)]
*  We're heading into South Carolina. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=210.2s)]
*  I understand the defiance. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=213.16s)]
*  Nikki Haley came out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, she's been getting more aggressive against President Trump, who is always aggressive [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=217.16s)]
*  himself. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=221.88s)]
*  I apologize for it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=223.12s)]
*  Is that going to work in the final days leading up to this primary on Saturday? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=224.28s)]
*  Oh, I don't think it is at all. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that, you know, she's had kind of a lot of problems, I would say, with her [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=231.24s)]
*  campaign all along, starting with the fact that she has kind of run this, you know, I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=235.68s)]
*  Am Woman, Hear Me Roar campaign and does a lot of sort of identity politics, almost [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=240.0s)]
*  like she's borrowing a lot of techniques from Democrats, which is a weird way to run [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=244.72s)]
*  in the Republican Party. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=248.96s)]
*  But, you know, once—I do, and I think Lisa is exactly right, you know, the idea that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=252.0s)]
*  she has to punk people and trick people into covering one of her campaigns is just sort [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=256.12s)]
*  of further—one of her events is further proof that it really is over. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=261.56s)]
*  We'll, you know, she'll—it appears that she's going to get beaten in South Carolina. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=267.2s)]
*  Hopefully she figures out how to get out and get out honorably, and then we can sort of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=271.72s)]
*  focus on the general election. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=276.72s)]
*  But if this election is about the issues and not about all of the noise that the media [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=278.84s)]
*  tries to bring into it and not about, you know, all the things that people want to make [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=284.32s)]
*  up and say about Donald Trump or whether he should be in jail and all this stuff, if it's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=288.0s)]
*  about the actual issues that people care about, like the economy and like the border and like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  crime, Donald Trump should win this by—with 80 percent of the vote, because 80 percent [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=297.12s)]
*  of Americans across the political spectrum and across economic, race, gender, everything, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=302.8s)]
*  80 percent of Americans want the America that Donald Trump is talking about and has demonstrated [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  he can bring. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=313.92s)]
*  Nobody wants this world that Joe Biden has given us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=316.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=320.04s)]
*  You know, Governor Huckabee, it's funny that Donald Trump at one point actually said, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=321.04s)]
*  Probably one more indictment away from being guaranteed that I'll get reelected. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=326.8s)]
*  I mean, only he would come up with that line. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  You got to admit there's some truth, though, behind it, and that is—I mean, I've always [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=336.44s)]
*  said that he seems to defy conventional political gravity, and that is he gets indicted, his [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=340.64s)]
*  poll numbers go up. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=346.72s)]
*  He gets arraigned, his poll numbers go up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=349.76s)]
*  He gets a mugshot. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=353.36s)]
*  He's selling more T-shirts online than anybody could ever wish for. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  How do you describe this phenomenon? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=360.2s)]
*  Have they so overreached and have they weaponized the justice system so much that the impossible [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=362.2s)]
*  has happened? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=370.36s)]
*  A guy as strong as Donald Trump, has he now become a victim? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, he's become a martyr in some ways, but I think what's happening, people in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=375.8s)]
*  America aren't as dumb as the Democrats think them to be. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=381.48s)]
*  And that's as simple as I can put it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=385.36s)]
*  They're just not that stupid. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=387.0s)]
*  They see through this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=388.76s)]
*  They see the political persecutions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=389.76s)]
*  They see Joe with open boxes of records in his garage, records he wasn't even supposed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  to have. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  And he gets, you know, a little, gee, we're not going to prosecute because you're old [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=398.8s)]
*  and you don't know what the heck's going on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump gets a raid on his home early in the morning, and they go through his wife's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  closet. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=409.12s)]
*  People look at that and they say, yeah, this ain't right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=410.5s)]
*  So honestly, Sean, what's happening is that the more they try to tear him down, the stronger [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=413.42s)]
*  he gets. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=418.62s)]
*  Nikki Haley, when she says chaos follows Donald Trump, she makes it like a negative. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=420.06s)]
*  Actually, what she really should admit is the reason chaos follows Donald Trump is because [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=425.34s)]
*  it's the chaos of the opposition. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=431.14s)]
*  the CIA, the IRS, the DOJ, using all of the powers of government to create chaos for him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=434.9s)]
*  It's just that he's the one guy that just might have the capacity to not only stand [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=443.06s)]
*  up to it, but to organize it and put it down once and for all and give this country back [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=448.34s)]
*  to the people who should own it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=453.38s)]
*  Let me ask you, Lisa, about Navalny. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  This was the opposition leader that was in prison in Russia that seems to have been murdered [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=461.48s)]
*  by that thug and murderer and dictator by the name of Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=465.76s)]
*  Nothing surprises me. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=471.16s)]
*  And a lot of people have tried to make the case that if Republicans want the border secure [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  first—that would be an America first policy—if they want our budget in balance first, before [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=481.2s)]
*  we consider more aid to Ukraine—it's not like we haven't given a lot of aid to Ukraine, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=486.8s)]
*  granted, everything you want to say about Putin being evil, I completely agree with. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=491.36s)]
*  He's evil, he's a murdering dictator thug, and he invaded a sovereign country, and he's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=496.8s)]
*  killed innocent men, women and children. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=502.12s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=504.2s)]
*  The whole world should unite against it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=505.2s)]
*  Frankly, the continent of Europe should have stepped up a lot more than we have. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=506.76s)]
*  Seventy-five billion dollars of taxpayer money is a lot. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=510.4s)]
*  I think the American people, if we did secure the border, if they did get the budget in [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=513.96s)]
*  balance, and probably they should make it alone, not a gift, then they might be able [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=519.48s)]
*  to open the door to that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=526.48s)]
*  But Democrats say, oh, if you insist on securing the border first and you're not willing [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=528.36s)]
*  to allow in 5,000 people a day, that means you must be a Putin apologist. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  No, apologist. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=539.12s)]
*  I certainly am not one. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=540.36s)]
*  I see him for what he is, who he is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=542.0s)]
*  He's evil. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=544.0s)]
*  Well, and there's also, you know, a sense of irony as Donald Trump's being persecuted [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=545.6s)]
*  by his enemies and by the president and Democrats here in the United States. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=551.24s)]
*  Look, I'm of the mindset, which this might be unpopular, I don't think Ukraine can [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=555.68s)]
*  win this thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=559.56s)]
*  We don't know what we're spending our money on. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=560.56s)]
*  There's no accountability with it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=562.4s)]
*  There's no transparency. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=563.88s)]
*  Ukraine has a history of corruption. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=565.76s)]
*  So does Joe Biden and his family, that has profited off of Ukraine as well. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=567.18s)]
*  So I would like to see some sort of deal come together, if possible, as opposed to just [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=571.0799999999999s)]
*  throwing money at this, you know, throwing money at the problem. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=575.92s)]
*  But you know, look, I just want to make one point about what Governor Huckabee said. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=579.48s)]
*  I think the DOJ report has taken away Joe Biden's Trump card. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=583.64s)]
*  His whole premise, his whole argument, this election cycle was the other guy is worse. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  And Americans know that's not true, because we saw what things looked like under Trump. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=592.56s)]
*  We've seen what it looks like under Joe Biden. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=597.0s)]
*  Now we know that Joe Biden is a crook. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=599.64s)]
*  He mishandled classified information since the 1970s, and he was a senator or vice president [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=602.16s)]
*  nowhere near the authority you have as a president, who has the ultimate authority on handling [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=607.16s)]
*  classified information, declassifying, classifying. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=611.76s)]
*  So I think the muddies have become—or the waters have become muddied, and Joe Biden [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=614.52s)]
*  no longer has really any argument to make heading into 2024. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=619.16s)]
*  You know, Charlie, I don't think the Republicans, as slim as their majority is in the House, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=622.72s)]
*  they're not supposed to be potted plants, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=629.16s)]
*  And I think for them to insist on secure borders and getting our budget in balance with $34 [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=632.68s)]
*  trillion in debt and saying, no, no more giveaways, maybe loans, maybe help in another way, that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  seems to be the right political formula. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  If you look at all these previous primaries, you look at these polls, they all show the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=650.76s)]
*  same thing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=654.28s)]
*  The American people are tired of nearly 10 million illegal, unvetted Joe Biden's immigrants [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=655.28s)]
*  that are crossing our border. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  There's been no vetting. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  We haven't checked their background. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=664.52s)]
*  And look at the countries they're coming from. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=665.52s)]
*  I've mentioned it many times. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=667.36s)]
*  China, Russia, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Iran, not vetted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=668.8s)]
*  And then, you know, we'll get into more detail later in the program. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=674.4s)]
*  But you know, I think that's an 80-20, maybe 85-15, maybe 90-10 issue in terms of what [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=677.16s)]
*  the American people want. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=684.56s)]
*  I want them to fight for that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=685.68s)]
*  And then we could have all those other conversations and have them quickly. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=687.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=690.48s)]
*  Yeah, and the biggest mistake Republicans on Capitol Hill made is they didn't agree [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=691.48s)]
*  to die on the Hill of protecting our border and closing the border. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=696.96s)]
*  They should have decided, both chambers, Republicans of both chambers decided that we will shut [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=701.52s)]
*  down the entire government, if that's what it takes, to force this administration to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=706.48s)]
*  enforce our laws and stop and seal the border and stop the border invasion. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=710.88s)]
*  And they failed to do that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  And what they wound up doing, actually, was proving that even more important than a Republican [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  majority in the House or the Senate is having Donald Trump as president in the White House, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=722.64s)]
*  because apparently the only way we're going to secure the border is to have, at the top [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=728.4s)]
*  of our executive branch, President Trump, who is willing to do whatever it takes to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=733.28s)]
*  secure the border. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=738.12s)]
*  And, you know, Governor Huckabee was just talking about the whole issue of chaos that [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=739.44s)]
*  Nikki Haley is talking about, and he's exactly right about this. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=744.08s)]
*  The idea that you're going to criticize Donald Trump for being this sort of nexus [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  of chaos or whatever, when it really is his opponents who are bringing the chaos. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=751.36s)]
*  But Donald Trump was elected to be a disruptor in Washington. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=756.8s)]
*  The chaos comes with that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=760.22s)]
*  People—you know, obviously, everybody would like life to be a bed of roses. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=762.08s)]
*  They would like politics to all be nice and sweet and everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  That's not where we are. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=769.36s)]
*  And the reason Donald Trump got elected in 2016, and the reason I think he's going [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=771.1600000000001s)]
*  to get re-elected again in 2024, is because people want disruption in Washington. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=774.5200000000001s)]
*  They don't want this to keep going the way it's going. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=780.2s)]
*  And you know, I think Republicans are the less bad party on Capitol Hill. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  But even they don't get it done. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  Only Donald Trump in the White House gets these things done. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=791.6s)]
*  All right, exit question for all three of you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=796.0s)]
*  Unless and until— [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=799.64s)]
*  These are always tricky. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=800.64s)]
*  —Governor, Ambassador Haley—I didn't hear what you said, Lisa, but unless and until [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=801.64s)]
*  Governor Haley gets a win, or single digits even, should Donald Trump strategically—Governor [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=808.8399999999999s)]
*  Huckabee, you're a smart politician—should he engage or should he ignore? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=816.0s)]
*  Your advice? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=820.76s)]
*  Ignore her. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=823.48s)]
*  Focus on Biden. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=824.48s)]
*  But more importantly, focus on what he can do for the American people, what he did do [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=825.48s)]
*  for them. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=829.24s)]
*  Ignore the opposition from within. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=830.76s)]
*  It's frankly immaterial. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=832.72s)]
*  Lisa, engage or ignore? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  Ignore her. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=840.04s)]
*  She has to lie to us, hoodwink us into watching a press conference. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=841.04s)]
*  There is no path for her in the primary. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  There's not even a path at a convention. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=847.36s)]
*  So Donald Trump is the guy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  Ignore Nikki Haley. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=851.92s)]
*  Have your sights set on Joe Biden and the Democrat Party at large. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=853.2s)]

*  Everybody, even the press— [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=857.2800000000001s)]

*  Even the press has moved on. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tr5ntmt6O8&t=860.2800000000001s)]
