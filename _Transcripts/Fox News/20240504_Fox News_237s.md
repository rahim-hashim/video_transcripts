# Biden wants an open border: Sen. Ron Johnson
**Fox News:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU)
*  Johnson, who signed on to that letter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Johnson, so we think about 130 hostages, five Americans, but we're prioritizing Gazan [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=2.92s)]
*  refugees? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  SEN. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=16.7s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=17.7s)]
*  JOHN CENA, HOST, SEN. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=18.7s)]
*  Because Joe Biden wants to win Michigan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=19.7s)]
*  That's the only explanation I have for this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=20.7s)]
*  You know, he opened up our border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=21.7s)]
*  He's let in six, seven, eight million people in this country, a couple million Goddaways. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=22.7s)]
*  We have no idea who those people are. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  We know all these military-age men from countries that are adversarial to America, members of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=28.08s)]
*  unbelievably brutal gangs from Mexico and South and Central America. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=35.32s)]
*  Why would you add to that clear and present danger by bringing in Palestinians who, let's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=40.32s)]
*  face it, they view us as infidels? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=44.96s)]
*  They not only hate Jews, they hate us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  They are also a clear and present danger. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=50.06s)]
*  This makes no sense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=52.9s)]
*  It is outrageous, but even worse than that, it is dangerous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=53.94s)]
*  You know, Senator Johnson, immigration has soared to the top of polling. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=57.76s)]
*  I imagine the reason for that is the lawless southern border, the millions of people who [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=62.28s)]
*  have come in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=66.8s)]
*  I imagine the reason that it's not at the top is because we haven't let in enough [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=67.8s)]
*  Gazan refugees. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=71.32s)]
*  Are we looking at a world where Biden may not take executive action to secure the lawless [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=73.02s)]
*  southern border, but he'll take executive action to let in Gazans? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=85.4s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that current law exudes deference to the president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=86.4s)]
*  And so President Biden had and used the same executive authority that President Trump used [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=92.28s)]
*  to secure the border to open it up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  He wants an open border. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=100.28s)]
*  His Democrat colleagues in Congress want an open border. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  The reason that he's getting away with this is the mainstream media will not hold them [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  accountable, and that goes back to really what's happening on campuses today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=110.0s)]
*  It's not just a one-off. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=114.12s)]
*  I know they're talking about professional agitators. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=116.76s)]
*  We've had professional agitators on our university campuses for decades. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=118.52s)]
*  They're called the radical professors, faculty and administration. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=122.96s)]
*  Not all of them, but let's face it, the vast majority of faculty are liberals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=126.96s)]
*  This has been—they have relentlessly infiltrated our university system. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=131.22s)]
*  They've been indoctrinating our children, our teachers, and of course our journalists. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=135.92s)]
*  They're no longer journalists. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=140.52s)]
*  They graduate advocates for the left. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=141.76s)]
*  This has been happening under the nose, stealthily and deceptively for decades. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=143.76s)]
*  You know, that's well said. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=148.76s)]
*  One other question on the Gazan refugees. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=151.76s)]
*  You know, refugee, as you know, has a very specific legal definition. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=153.64s)]
*  There has to be persecution. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  It has to be based on nationality, religion or political views. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  So I'm thinking about these Gazans coming in as refugees and claiming persecution based [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  on religion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=168.84s)]
*  So would they technically be coming here, claiming that our greatest American ally, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=170.04s)]
*  Israel, is their persecutor? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=174.8s)]
*  Well, again, asylum status, you have to have your own government threaten you with that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=176.8s)]
*  type of persecution. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=183.4s)]
*  You know, Kayleigh, there's a reason that the Arab nations have not accepted Palestinian [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=184.4s)]
*  refugees for decades. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=190.08s)]
*  Had they done that, we wouldn't have this problem today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=191.64s)]
*  They don't do it because it's awful the way young children in Palestine are indoctrinated [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=194.2s)]
*  to hate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  Not only Jews, but all infidels. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  And so they're dangerous people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=202.92s)]
*  And so they try and keep them bottled up in Gaza or the West Bank. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=204.56s)]
*  And so this continues to spill over into these horrific incidences. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=208.04s)]
*  But we need to keep it bottled up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=213.48s)]
*  We need to let Israel destroy Hamas and then try and live in peace with Palestinians who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=215.2s)]
*  are willing to do so. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=220.44s)]
*  Senator Johnson, thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2d0XDsjIU&t=222.64s)]
