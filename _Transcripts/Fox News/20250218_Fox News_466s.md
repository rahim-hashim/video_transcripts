# Karoline Leavitt reveals how DOGE employees will 'dig into the books'
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ)
*  It wasn't long ago, top Democrats, people that you know were advocating for Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  very plan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=6.72s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=7.72s)]
*  This report tells us how to cut waste, cut red tape, streamline the bureaucracy, change [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=9.72s)]
*  procurement rules, change the personnel rules, and create a government that works better [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=16.84s)]
*  and costs less. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=22.72s)]
*  By paying for these plans first with cuts in government waste and efficiency, second [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=24.54s)]
*  with cuts, not gimmicks in government spending. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=29.68s)]
*  We'll prove that we can spend the money we have in an appropriate way and stop wasting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=32.12s)]
*  so much of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=36.12s)]
*  But over the next several months, we will be looking at every other agency and program, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=37.12s)]
*  asking the direct question, do we really need this agency? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=43.92s)]
*  Do we really need this program? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=47.72s)]
*  Twenty years into a period in our history where most American wage earners are working [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=49.4s)]
*  longer work weeks for stagnant wages. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=55.16s)]
*  It is outrageous for the government to have rules and regulations which take those people's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=58.4s)]
*  money from them and spend it on things that cannot be justified. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=64.14s)]
*  One of the commitments that I made the American people was that we would do a better job here [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=68.6s)]
*  in Washington in rooting out wasteful spending. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=74.12s)]
*  Ah, amazing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=78.6s)]
*  They sound like Donald Trump, except they never got the job done. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  How times have changed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=83.82s)]
*  Now tonight there are reports of a collective panic in the Washington swamp, a flood of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=84.82s)]
*  new real estate listings as Trump dismantles the Washington bureaucracy at a rapid pace, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=89.58s)]
*  which brings us to our Hannity Washington Brief with Caroline Levin. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=95.38s)]
*  And joining us with more, White House press secretary, the one and only Caroline Levin. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  I got these clips today and I looked at them and I said, oh, wow, they wanted to be Donald [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  Trump, but they weren't able to pull it off. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=114.86s)]
*  That's exactly right, Sean. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=117.9s)]
*  If you just watched that video, but shut your eyes and listen to the words from those Democrat [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=119.1s)]
*  politicians, you would think you are listening to president Trump, Elon Musk, and our entire [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  administration who are saying the exact same things that Democrat politicians promise the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=129.34s)]
*  American people they would do for decades. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=134.78s)]
*  President Trump is just the first president in our lifetimes to actually do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=137.26s)]
*  And now you see the Democrat Party in the mainstream media spiraling out of control [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=141.78s)]
*  about a very simple promise, rooting out waste, fraud and abuse from our federal bureaucracy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=146.58s)]
*  This is a promise President Trump campaigned on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=153.3s)]
*  He is now delivering on it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=155.8s)]
*  And I've been fighting fake news reporters all day long here in the Washington, D.C. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=157.6s)]
*  swamp who are trying to fear monger the American people into believing that this administration [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=162.34s)]
*  is going after their hard earned tax dollars and their hard earned Social Security checks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=167.82s)]
*  So I want to set the record straight on your show tonight, Sean, and I'm very grateful [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=172.14s)]
*  for the opportunity to do so. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=176.82s)]
*  President Trump has directed Elon Musk and the Doge team to identify fraud at the Social [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=179.18s)]
*  Security Administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=184.62s)]
*  They haven't dug into the books yet, but they suspect that there are tens of millions of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  deceased people who are receiving fraudulent Social Security payments. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=190.7s)]
*  And so their goal in going into the Social Security Administration is to identify three [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=195.3s)]
*  things. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=200.5s)]
*  Number one, to identify duplicate payments and to end them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=201.5s)]
*  Number two, to identify payments that are going to deceased people who are no longer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=206.18s)]
*  living and should no longer be receiving that money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=210.7s)]
*  And number three, to protect the integrity of this system for hardworking Americans who [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=214.14s)]
*  have been paying into it their entire lives. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=219.42s)]
*  So rest assured to all of the people watching your show tonight, if you paid into the system, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=221.88s)]
*  honestly, you will continue to receive your Social Security checks. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=227.04s)]
*  Do not buy into the lies from the legacy fake news media who are trying to fear you and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=231.72s)]
*  scare you into believing otherwise. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=236.76s)]
*  This is what we've seen them do about President Trump for years with every promise that he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=239.12s)]
*  has made. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=242.88s)]
*  And he's going in there to protect your hard earned money. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=243.88s)]
*  That is the ultimate goal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=246.84s)]
*  OK, they have apparently found 8.7 million Americans who are listed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=248.72s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that—we don't know if they're being paid, but they're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  listed and they're on the Social Security roll. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Their names are there that are over 130 years old, 8.7 million Americans listed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=263.92s)]
*  And as Elon said, far more eligible Social Security numbers than their actual six. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=272.48s)]
*  They're citizens in the U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  But we don't know yet if checks are being sent to either individuals that are dead or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  maybe family members that are receiving them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  We just know their names are still on the list, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=289.24s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=292.76s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=293.76s)]
*  There are a lot of unanswered questions, but that's exactly why these Social Security [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=295.64s)]
*  employees, I may add, are digging into the books and going line by line, because past [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  administrations have refused to do this very time-consuming but necessary work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=305.96s)]
*  And I want to emphasize that these are Social Security political appointees. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=311.0s)]
*  With every change of a new administration, you have new political appointees just like [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=315.88s)]
*  me and my colleagues at the White House who on board to serve the elected president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=320.36s)]
*  That's called a democracy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=325.08s)]
*  And for far too long, we've had a bureaucracy that has been running these agencies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=327.12s)]
*  And look at what—look at what has resulted in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=331.96s)]
*  Tens of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse every single year that we know of. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=334.48s)]
*  And so these Doge employees, these Social Security employees, are on boarding as Social [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=339.68s)]
*  Security Administration employees, political appointees, and they have every right to administer [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=344.70000000000005s)]
*  President Trump's agenda. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=349.92s)]
*  And that's their main focus with this effort, not just at Social Security, but of course [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=351.42s)]
*  at every agency, as you know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to give away the interview tomorrow with President Trump and Elon, but I can give [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=358.8s)]
*  a few headlines. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=363.88s)]
*  There's no conflict between them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=365.32s)]
*  There's no power struggle. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=367.88s)]
*  There's no ambiguity as to who the president is. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=369.76s)]
*  And what I observe, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, are people that had [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  a great relationship. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=379.32s)]
*  I don't want to give too much away. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=380.32s)]
*  People will decide for themselves. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  You were there for a lot of it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=384.7s)]
*  You agree? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  I definitely agree. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=388.04s)]
*  And I witness this relationship firsthand every single day in the Oval Office and at [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=390.48s)]
*  the White House. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=395.56s)]
*  And President Trump has tasked Elon Musk with administering his America First agenda, just [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=396.56s)]
*  like the rest of us who serve at the pleasure of the president, but most importantly serve [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=402.8s)]
*  the American people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=407.04s)]
*  More than 77 million Americans re-elected President Trump to promote monumental, fundamental [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=408.16s)]
*  to shake up the Washington swamp. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=416.04s)]
*  And there's nobody better than Elon Musk to do that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=418.96s)]
*  He is a once in a generation business leader. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=421.44s)]
*  He sent rocket ships to space. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=424.32s)]
*  He's far smarter than many of the people who are grunting and moaning on Capitol Hill about [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=426.24s)]
*  these efforts are. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=430.72s)]
*  And he's the perfect person to help President Trump with this effort. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=432.32s)]
*  The mainstream media wants to drive a wedge between their relationship, but they are failing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=435.2s)]
*  And our entire team is unified behind President Trump to deliver on the promises he made to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=439.74s)]
*  the American people on the campaign trail. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=445.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=447.36s)]
*  That is this week's Hannity White House briefing with White House Press Secretary Caroline [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=448.48s)]
*  Levitt. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=453.48s)]
*  Caroline, great to have you as always. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=454.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxYp0dHfqwQ&t=455.48s)]
