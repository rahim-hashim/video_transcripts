# Sean Hannity:  Tim Walz was visibly nervous
**Fox News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0)
*  Welcome to Hannity the first the only vice presidential debate is now in the books. We are live. We are in the spin room [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are in New York City now coming up tonight [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=6.18s)]
*  We're gonna get reaction from Senator Ted Cruz Donald Trump jr. Is here the vague Ramaswami the man of the hour [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=8.6s)]
*  JD Vance will be coming into the spin room who I think kind of wiped the floor with Tim Walz who seemed very nervous all night [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=14.46s)]
*  Make no mistake. This was a consequential debate. It will in my view register in the polls. It will boost Donald Trump you decide [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=22.18s)]
*  When did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=30.68s)]
*  It was during the administration of Kamala Harris ask yourself at home when when was the last time? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=34.44s)]
*  I'm 40 years old [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=41.26s)]
*  What was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict breakout? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=42.26s)]
*  The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president. Look, we all want to solve this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=46.36s)]
*  I most of us want to solve this and that is the United States Congress [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=51.06s)]
*  That's the Border Patrol agents the people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio are the American citizens who have had their lives [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  Destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace Tim and I actually think I agree with you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=63.54s)]
*  I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does you're gonna hear a lot from Tim [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=69.34s)]
*  Walz this evening and you just heard it in the answer a lot of what Kamala Harris [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=74.38s)]
*  Proposes to do and some of it I'll be honest with you. It even sounds pretty good [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=77.98s)]
*  Here's what you won't hear is that Kamala Harris has already done it if Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=82.1s)]
*  Middle-class problems then she ought to do them now not when asking for promotion [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=89.22s)]
*  But in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago what Tim Walz is doing and I honestly Tim [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=94.12s)]
*  I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=99.66s)]
*  You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take-home pay, which of course he did [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=102.74s)]
*  You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=107.24s)]
*  Which of course he did and then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=110.92s)]
*  Which has made gas groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  Now vice well soon to be maybe vice president Vance was measured. He was prepared compassionate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  Obviously smart intelligent bright [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=128.8s)]
*  Showed a lot of compassion and the country really got to meet JD Vance tonight [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=131.24s)]
*  Not a caricature that the media mob state-run media mob create created of him and as they do of Donald Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=136.2s)]
*  Meanwhile Tim Wal, he didn't look very comfortable [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=142.5s)]
*  Visibly nervous constantly making well kind of weird faces trying to deliver rehearsed lines Tim Walz [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  Also lied over and over again [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=152.06s)]
*  We fact-checked him lied about taxes pretended only the wealthy Americans would see a tax hike under the Harris and Walz [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=154.1s)]
*  Administration that's false. He lied about the border pretending that illegal immigration numbers are lower than under Trump, which is false [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=162.42s)]
*  Totally false. He lied about abortion. He lied about housing. He lied about inflation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=169.62s)]
*  2025 the project that well only exists in their mind [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=174.3s)]
*  He lied about regulations and when asked about another lie surrounding his time in China Tim Walz kind of embarrassed himself [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=177.72s)]
*  This is a moment to watch [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  Governor Walz [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=187.18s)]
*  You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989 [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=194.94000000000003s)]
*  Can you explain that discrepancy? Yeah, well into the folks out there didn't get at the top of this. Look, I I grew up in small rural [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=203.52s)]
*  Nebraska town of 400 town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on and I'm proud of that service now [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=218.16s)]
*  They look I I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=221.7s)]
*  I've tried to do the best I can but I've not been perfect and I'm a knucklehead at times [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=226.4s)]
*  I will say more than anything many times. I I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=230.94s)]
*  But being there the impact it made the difference it made in my life [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=237.82s)]
*  I learned a lot about China governor just to follow up on that the question was can you explain the no [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=241.84s)]
*  Presency all I said on this was is I got there that summer and misspoke on this. So I I will just [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=248.26s)]
*  That's what I've said [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=253.98s)]
*  Now Tim walls clearly and over his head despite plenty of assistance from the well [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=256.5s)]
*  Blatantly biased CBS moderators walls didn't look pretty good [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  Didn't look good in any way tonight and by the way CBS they should frankly be ashamed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=265.18s)]
*  They didn't keep to the rules so-called moderators immediately broke their promise not to serve as fact-checkers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=269.3s)]
*  In order to help Tim walls and push their own political views as quote facts [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=274.64s)]
*  Meanwhile this country and the world are absolutely deteriorating under the failed far-left [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=279.32s)]
*  Radical policies the feckless leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  That was a point made over and over again by JD Vance tonight now. We have a mounting crisis at home [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=289.34s)]
*  Overseas things will only get worse if Kamala Harris gets a promotion. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0&t=296.0s)]
