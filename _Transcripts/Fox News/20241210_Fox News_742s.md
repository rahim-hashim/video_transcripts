# Sean Hannity: Cheering for the murder of an unarmed man is beyond sick
**Fox News:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8)
*  tonight with two other stories out of New York City that provide a very disturbing glimpse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=0.0s)]
*  into the radical elements that represent the new, modern, extreme, radical Democratic Party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=5.88s)]
*  As we speak, some on the left, they are now literally cheering for the cold-blooded killer [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=12.26s)]
*  accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=18.46s)]
*  This guy was a husband and a father. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=22.98s)]
*  At the very same time, they are vilifying Daniel Penny, who was just found not guilty [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=24.7s)]
*  of negligent homicide by a New York City jury. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=30.22s)]
*  While prosecutors, they attempted to throw Penny in prison after he restrained what was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=33.7s)]
*  a deranged career criminal who was high on drugs, making death threats, lunging at passengers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=39.56s)]
*  on a New York City subway. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=45.82s)]
*  In a minute, we're going to bring you exclusive new clips from Judge Pirro's interview with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=47.76s)]
*  which will air in full on Fox Nation tomorrow. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=53.24s)]
*  But first, let us focus on the left's new folk hero, Luigi Mangione. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  That's a 26-year-old from Townsend, Maryland. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=62.84s)]
*  Seemingly, this guy had it all, born into a wealthy Maryland family. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=66.28s)]
*  He was a prep school valedictorian. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=70.68s)]
*  He went on to earn not one but two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  He's now accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly shooting the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=77.64s)]
*  father of two in the back just before a 7 a.m., you know, morning in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Now, some who feel wronged by the health insurance industry and others on the left that want [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  to, quote, eat the rich, they are actually out there celebrating this assassination, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  this murder, glorifying the purported killer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=102.5s)]
*  People are actually buying T-shirts and merchandise promoting the murder. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=106.28s)]
*  And the McDonald's, where Mangione was arrested after a tip from somebody working there, is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=112.52s)]
*  receiving death threats and scores of one-star reviews on Google. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=117.76s)]
*  The rhetoric on the left, it is totally unhinged, unglued. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=123.0s)]
*  You decide. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=126.64s)]
*  Why would you be in such a celebratory mood about the execution of another human being? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=128.36s)]
*  Aren't you supposed to be on the caring, sharing left where, you know, you believe in the sanctity of life? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=134.6s)]
*  I do believe in the sanctity of life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think that's why I felt, along with so many other Americans, joy, unfortunately, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=144.28s)]
*  you know, because it feels like… [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=150.0s)]
*  Joy? Serious? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=151.72s)]
*  I mean… [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=152.72s)]
*  Joy in a man's execution? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=153.72s)]
*  I guess I would say maybe not joy, but certainly not empathy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=154.72s)]
*  Something a bit unexpected has happened following the murder. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=159.4s)]
*  A reaction not of universal horror, that a 50-year-old father of two and husband was [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=163.08s)]
*  shot dead in public, but rather of, and I don't want to call it glee, but let's just say not unhappiness. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=167.88s)]
*  I was looking at some of the social media comments, and I try to stay away from social [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=174.64s)]
*  media, but it said some of the comments were thoughts and deductibles to the family. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=178.08s)]
*  One of the comments was, unfortunately, my condolences are out of network. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=183.32s)]
*  And so I think it really, isn't that something? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=187.2s)]
*  I really think it's reflective about how people are feeling about their healthcare. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=189.36s)]
*  Okay, no doubt there are Americans that have very legitimate and serious concerns about [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=193.0s)]
*  the healthcare industry in our country, which frankly has become even more expensive and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  complex with fewer options after Obamacare. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=204.56s)]
*  But that's separate and apart. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Cheering for the murder of an unarmed man is beyond sick. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=211.0s)]
*  And unlike Mangione, all-United Healthcare CEO, he did not grow up in a world of privilege. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Brian Thompson, he's from a small town. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=221.56s)]
*  He's from Iowa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  His father worked a green elevator. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=225.16s)]
*  He attended public school, the University of Iowa. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=227.64s)]
*  After college, he worked his way up the corporate ladder. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=231.0s)]
*  Brian Thompson was a father of two, an avid supporter of the Special Olympics. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=234.12s)]
*  Now, maybe you have an issue with your health insurance or your car insurance or your home [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=239.2s)]
*  insurance. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  You can hate a company. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  You can hate the entire insurance industry. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  But murder, assassination, vigilantism, it's wrong, it's evil, it's despicable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=250.16s)]
*  And Luigi Mangione is no hero. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=256.52s)]
*  And according to reports, his behavior apparently became very erratic over the last six months. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=259.5s)]
*  And today, his theatrics again on full display. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=264.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=268.2s)]
*  So, this is the left wing in America, the new hero, a seemingly deranged Ivy League [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=275.24s)]
*  grad accused of shooting an unarmed father of two in the back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=283.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, Daniel Penny, he is treated like a monster by many on the left. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=288.04s)]
*  In fact, New York's woke prosecutors, they tried to ruin his life. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=292.08s)]
*  He was a hero in real life. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  After the former Marine, he was only trying to protect his fellow passengers riding on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=298.32s)]
*  the New York City subway underground from a violent individual, his name Jordan Neely, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=303.44s)]
*  who had an open warrant for his arrest, a history of gruesome subway assaults, including [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  two elderly people, one a woman. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=314.36s)]
*  At the time of the incident, Neely was high on drugs and lunging at passengers while threatening [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=316.76s)]
*  to kill those around him and himself. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=321.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  He just very aggressively kind of like ran on and stumbled on. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  As New Yorkers, you kind of come to accept that is unfortunately a normal occurrence. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=332.48s)]
*  And what was he saying? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=341.8s)]
*  What was he doing? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=344.12s)]
*  What drew your attention to him? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=345.12s)]
*  Well, I noticed him at first when he came on, you know, and the doors closed. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=347.72s)]
*  And as soon as the doors closed, he was carrying a jacket and he whipped the jacket down and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=355.6s)]
*  it landed on the feet. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=361.0s)]
*  I was standing and it landed on the feet of the passengers sitting down next to me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=363.2s)]
*  And the zipper made a very audible noise. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=367.68s)]
*  It was very loud and very aggressive. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=371.52s)]
*  And at that point, the train car went completely silent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=374.28s)]
*  It almost felt like a vacuum. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=380.36s)]
*  And there was like this hollow feeling. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=384.32s)]
*  That's when I first kind of gave him my full attention. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, so the train becomes silent. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  What if anything does he say? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, he first comes on and he starts demanding things. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  He's demanded three different things, you know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=404.2s)]
*  Certain types of food, certain types of drinks and, you know, things that like some type [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=408.2s)]
*  of fast food. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=412.76s)]
*  And that he was he was willing to go to jail forever if he didn't get these things. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  And then it kind of escalated. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=421.8s)]
*  You say you repeated, I was going to go to jail for life. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=425.32s)]
*  I'm willing to hurt people. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm willing to kill people. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to kill people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is this keep in mind, this is all within 15 seconds of him getting on the train. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=432.08s)]
*  And it was this escalation of violence and threatening behavior that it was just. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=438.2s)]
*  It was pretty serious when when he said he was willing to kill people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=445.08s)]
*  Did you believe him? Yeah, totally. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=449.0s)]
*  It was unlike, you know, because there's outbursts on the train all the time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=450.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, New York City, there's. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=455.32s)]
*  There's always people coming on and saying kind of. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=458.4s)]
*  Talking crazy and. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=465.12s)]
*  This was unlike anything that I've ever experienced, and it was. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  It it was very serious, it was I completely believed what he was saying. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  It was just what was the reaction by the fellow subway riders? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=478.76s)]
*  Well, when, like I said, when there was that silence, when there was that vacuum, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=483.76s)]
*  I mean, everybody was had it like he got everybody's attention. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  How close was he to the people as he was telling them or saying, I'm going to kill someone? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=493.6s)]
*  He started off in the middle of the of the train by the pole, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=499.48s)]
*  and then he would in that in that escalation, he would he started to get in people's faces [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  with within a foot of people. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=507.72s)]
*  What was there? There was a woman with a baby in a carriage. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=509.64000000000004s)]
*  What did she do? Children. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=513.44s)]
*  Kids going to school, coming back from school, it was just like it was it was what you'd expect [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=516.0s)]
*  on a normal New York City subway train or subway car. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=521.16s)]
*  It was. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=524.12s)]
*  Yeah, the mother was was holding her child and. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=527.4s)]
*  The the school kids were protecting themselves or holding each other and just people were. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=532.0s)]
*  Stuck to their chairs and they they felt pinned and I felt pinned, I felt nervous, I felt scared. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, thankfully, this week, Penny was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide and rightfully so. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=548.0s)]
*  But the ladies at that hard hitting news show, The View, they're not happy about the verdict, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  even though we had witness after witness after witness and those that tried to make this issue [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=558.32s)]
*  about race, including an African-American woman that was on the train, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=562.88s)]
*  had actually said thank you to Daniel Penny, saying that they felt their life was in jeopardy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=566.36s)]
*  Maybe they didn't hear or read about that testimony. Take a look. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=571.24s)]
*  Penny's defense was that he was deescalating the situation after Neely threatened other commuters [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  and he celebrated the verdict with his lawyer while Neely's family was mourning the loss. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=582.12s)]
*  I mean, you killed a guy, the man is dead, and maybe just you take the celebration home, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=590.88s)]
*  you don't do it outside, but that's just me. Don't listen to anything I say. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, I do wonder, does ABC send limousines and SUVs for the ladies of The View, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=601.96s)]
*  or do they take the subway? Do they ever take the subway? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=610.32s)]
*  Daniel Penny stepped up to prevent his fellow subway riders from being harmed [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=614.32s)]
*  by a guy making death threats, acting erratically. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=618.72s)]
*  He shielded every single person on that subway car from harm, black, white, men, women, everyone. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=621.72s)]
*  But the group Black Lives Matter doesn't care about any of that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=629.28s)]
*  They are now calling for vigilantism and vengeance against white people. Take a look. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=632.88s)]
*  Just like everybody else has vigilantes, we need some black vigilantes. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=639.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=645.96s)]
*  People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=647.44s)]
*  How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  Less than an hour and 20 minutes later, they said not guilty. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=659.96s)]
*  These wonderful white people, I hope they celebrate their Christmas [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=663.6s)]
*  while the Neely family is praying and asking God for comfort. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=667.48s)]
*  God damn them and God damn America. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  Wow. So many on the left, this is not about truth, it is not about justice, or even life. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  For them, it is one political game. Take a look. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=681.52s)]
*  These public officials would do something so self-serving. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  But how does it serve them to hurt you? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=694.8s)]
*  Just political gain. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=697.4s)]
*  I mean, these are their policies that are, and I don't mean to get political, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=699.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't really want to make any enemies really, although I guess I have already. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  But I mean, these are their policies that have clearly not worked, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=711.84s)]
*  that the people, the general population are not in support of yet. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=715.12s)]
*  Their egos are too big just to admit that they're wrong. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=721.04s)]
*  Again, the full interview will air tomorrow on FoxNation.com. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIhWYFdMwg8&t=726.36s)]
