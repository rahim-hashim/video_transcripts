# 'GUARANTEE': Tim Scott makes bold prediction on Trump's White House run
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI)
*  Joining us now is South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the more interesting things we keep seeing in every poll areâ€”is the Democratic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=5.04s)]
*  Party, the demographics that traditionally make up their coalition and their base. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=11.32s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women are now moving in massive [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=15.92s)]
*  numbers to the Republican Party. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=23.38s)]
*  We have seen past movement not as large as this, but in the end it seems that, well, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=25.96s)]
*  Democrats tend to return home on Election Day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=32.84s)]
*  Is this year different? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, Sean, 1000 percent this year is different. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=37.92s)]
*  In football, it's not the Xs and the Os, it's the Jimmies and the Joes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=42.92s)]
*  We have a once-in-a-lifetime leader called Donald Trump who's bringing a coalition together [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=47.64s)]
*  like never before. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=53.64s)]
*  I will predict that President Trump will receive more Republican votes than any Republican [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=54.96s)]
*  in the history of the country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=60.24s)]
*  I predict that he will have more African American support this cycle than any other Republican [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=61.6s)]
*  in 30 years, and I predict he will likely win the Hispanic vote. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=67.48s)]
*  He's at 47, 45 right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=72.8s)]
*  But the question is why? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=75.04s)]
*  Why are African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Republicans, men, women all looking at Donald [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=76.52s)]
*  Trump with new eyes? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=83.28s)]
*  It is simple. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=84.92s)]
*  We were better off under Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=86.48s)]
*  Economically, the lowest unemployment rates for all racial demographics and a 70-year [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=89.08s)]
*  low for women. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=94.52s)]
*  Crime, we had law and order. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=96.2s)]
*  African Americans in Minneapolis voted to refund the police and overturn their own city [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=99.52s)]
*  council who wanted to defund the police. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=105.72s)]
*  Here's what we know about Americans. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Americans want a fair level playing field, and there's only one candidate and one party [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=111.6s)]
*  that represents that, and that's Donald Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  We want a border that is closed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=119.96s)]
*  I tell you, this is the truth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=122.56s)]
*  Migrant crime is devastating black communities and white communities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=124.96s)]
*  We look at Lake and Riley, and we come to one conclusion, preventable. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  We have Joe Biden talking about, is she, was it an illegal immigrant or was it an undocumented? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=135.76s)]
*  It was a murderer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=143.16s)]
*  We should be up and arms on our feet talking about the issues that every single kitchen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=144.84s)]
*  table is talking about tonight, and it starts with our border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=152.04s)]
*  It starts with Lake and Riley, and then it goes to our economy and goes to crime. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=155.98s)]
*  We are going to win because we have the right candidate at the right time with a record [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=161.44s)]
*  all right on every single issue that matters to Americans. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=168.2s)]
*  Are issues enough or what about what Reince was discussing and that's process and paying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=173.6s)]
*  attention to those other details? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=178.4s)]
*  Well, let me tell you what. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=180.36s)]
*  If there's anyone paying attention to the details of 2024, it's Donald Trump who is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=183.68s)]
*  now running, co-running the RNC. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=188.84s)]
*  Laura Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=191.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=193.16s)]
*  Because he understands that the devil's in the details. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=194.16s)]
*  So he puts his brilliant daughter-in-law in charge of our RNC apparatus so that all that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=197.64s)]
*  Reince talked about, wise, wise man he is, will be taken care of. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=203.76s)]
*  We're going to focus on getting the vote out early, often, mail in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=208.84s)]
*  Whatever it takes, we will match fire with fire. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you want the ball in the hands of the best player on the field. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=218.33999999999997s)]
*  That player is Donald Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=225.05999999999997s)]
*  I can guarantee you we will win because we're coming together. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Senator, hope you're right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  We can't take four more years of this corpse as president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=235.92s)]
*  Anyway, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=239.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=241.22s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm39TXcpjKI&t=242.22s)]
