# New batch of Epstein documents reveal bombshell information
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA)
*  First, well, we get to the newest release from the Epstein case just earlier, not that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=0.0s)]
*  long ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=5.04s)]
*  Tonight, a second batch of court documents were unsealed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=6.04s)]
*  Joining us now with all the details, our very own, very own Nate Foy is with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=9.4s)]
*  Nate, what's the latest? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=13.68s)]
*  Hey, Sean. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=14.68s)]
*  In this new batch of documents, lawyers for Virginia Joufray and Ghislaine Maxwell discuss [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=15.68s)]
*  pictures of Maxwell at Chelsea Clinton's wedding as possible evidence in the 2015 civil case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=21.68s)]
*  Bill Clinton himself is again mentioned by Joufray in an email she wrote about a publisher [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=29.52s)]
*  labeled VF, presumably Vanity Fair. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=35.16s)]
*  It reads, quote, the email, it does concern me what they want to write about me, considering [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=39.16s)]
*  that B. Clinton walked into VF and threatened them not to write sex trafficking article [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=44.2s)]
*  about his good friend J.E. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=50.2s)]
*  Clinton denies this claim through a spokesperson. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=53.36s)]
*  Bernie Allen Dershowitz is again mentioned in the documents, accused of having sex with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=56.48s)]
*  an underage girl, a charge that Dershowitz strongly denies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=61.08s)]
*  And tonight he's coming out saying that there are smoking guns that have not been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=66.28s)]
*  released yet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=70.28s)]
*  With tonight's second batch, 59 documents are now unsealed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=71.84s)]
*  Joufray's lawyer tells Fox News 240 documents are coming in total, so we're about 25 percent [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=76.16s)]
*  of the way through. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  It could take until Monday before they're all released. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  We'll send it back to you, Sean. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=85.32s)]
*  Alright, Nate Foy, thank you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxBYCf7eA&t=87.32s)]
