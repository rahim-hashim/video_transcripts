# 'IT'S SCARY': Rand Paul warns of Biden's 'competency' to US national security
**Fox News:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4)
*  All right, Republican lawmakers, they have been raising concerns over Biden's mental [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=0.0s)]
*  fitness now for many years. And after yesterday's really damning report and disastrous press [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=7.44s)]
*  conference, more Republicans, they're speaking out. They're questioning whether or not Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=13.0s)]
*  should be replaced on the 2024 ticket. And even Democrats know how much trouble Joe is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=17.26s)]
*  in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=23.2s)]
*  Now, this morning, Democratic strategist Paul Bagala admitted that Biden's only chance of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=24.2s)]
*  winning is by using anti-Trump scare tactics. That's all they've been doing anyway. Take [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=28.22s)]
*  a look. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=33.7s)]
*  This is terrible for Democrats and anybody with a functioning brain knows that. But here's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=34.7s)]
*  what you do. Instead of calling a press conference saying, I really am sharp, you attack the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  other guy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=45.58s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden gave the strategy in 2012. I remember he was vice president and he said, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=46.58s)]
*  don't compare us to the Almighty, compare us to the alternative. So everything with Biden [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  has to be not, I'm great. But the other guy's really damaging, dangerous, a threat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul, he poked fun at Biden's gaffes yesterday with this post on X saying, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=65.52s)]
*  quote, he's going to build a wall with Gaza and make Mexico pay for it. And boy, are they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=70.42s)]
*  going to be confused. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=76.58s)]
*  Anyway, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joins us now. I mean, it's been transparent for a long [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=77.58s)]
*  time. The media mob, I don't even think they're in denial. I think they're just a bunch of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=82.7s)]
*  liberal hacks that claim to be journalists that aren't journalists. So I think it's very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=87.22s)]
*  transparent. But you know, Newt just touched on something really important. This is dangerous [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=92.22s)]
*  now. It's officially dangerous. Our enemies read this report. They got a summary of this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=98.42s)]
*  report this morning and I could only imagine their reaction. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=103.9s)]
*  It would be funny if it weren't tragic and if it weren't scary. Think about this. The [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=109.1s)]
*  bar for trying someone for competency is very, very low. Routinely in our courts, we do [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  try people with a bare minimum of intelligence. They try to ask them if they know right from [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=119.14s)]
*  wrong. If you can discern right from wrong, you can actually be tried in most courts, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=124.3s)]
*  even with limited intelligence. So you have to realize that they're judging our president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=129.14s)]
*  to be below that very low standard of competence that he couldn't go through a trial because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=134.22s)]
*  people would perceive him as maybe unable to understand the difference between right [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=139.05999999999997s)]
*  and wrong and with a memory so bad that he's basically not competent for trial. We've never [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=144.14s)]
*  had a president with that low standard and it isn't just tragic or funny. It's scary [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  because yes, we have a nuclear arsenal. Complicated decisions would have to be made within minutes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=155.38s)]
*  if someone were attacking us. And yes, this does give our enemies a window into a situation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=161.7s)]
*  that is very, very dangerous. And for the Democrats to say, oh, we're just going to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=168.22s)]
*  ignore his incompetence to the level of not even be competent that he could be tried and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=173.26s)]
*  we're going to say, well, let's just attack the other guy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=178.06s)]
*  Sometimes political attacks work, but there have been so many attacks on Trump that he's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  probably the king of Teflon in the sense that so much of it bounces off. But this is going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  to stick to Biden and I think he's going to have a difficult time running. They can try [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  putting him in the basement again, like they did during covid. And frankly, that's about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  all they can do. They should take him off of the trail, put him in a basement. But we [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  should not relent in pointing out that he can't even pass the competency test to be [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=202.34s)]
*  tried as an adult. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=207.62s)]
*  I mean, these are devastating comments that he had and displayed significant limitations [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=208.62s)]
*  in memory. He didn't remember when he was vice president. He didn't know if it was was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=215.32s)]
*  I still vice president in 2009 and what 2013, whatever year it was. And he does he doesn't [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=221.12s)]
*  know these things, but they did conclude that he willfully retain and disclose classified [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=227.2s)]
*  materials. I don't think you get to have it both ways. I don't think you get to say, yeah, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=232.12s)]
*  he definitely did this willfully, but because he's a cognitive mess and he's going to come [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=237.6s)]
*  off as a nice guy with that's old with memory loss, that no jury will convict him, that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=242.92s)]
*  that's a way out. And I think Josh Hawley is right in that sense in saying either indict [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=248.72s)]
*  him or invoke the 25th Amendment. But I don't think you're going to get that out of this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=253.56s)]
*  attorney general. I think he has been weaponized that department to such an extent you'd never [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=257.52s)]
*  see an act of courage like that ever. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=263.48s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's important if we're talking about Biden and Trump, you know, both [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=265.84s)]
*  having classified records, but there's going to be a different standard. But it even goes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=270.44s)]
*  beyond that. Equal protection under the law, when we have failed that in our country, when [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=273.92s)]
*  it didn't seem to be adhered to during the 1950s and 60s or maybe before as well for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=278.72s)]
*  African-Americans, it led to civil strife in our country. And we got beyond that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=283.44s)]
*  But it was a very difficult time in our history. And we made the law better. And we have equal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=287.92s)]
*  protection, I think, regardless of race. And I think we do a much better job than we ever [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  did 50, 70 years ago. But now, if you don't have equal justice under the law because of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=296.16s)]
*  the shade of your ideology, it can be just as bad. There can be strife. There can be [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  unrest. There can be civil discord. There can be a real problem in a country if this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=306.36s)]
*  extends where only certain people are prosecuted and other people aren't. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=311.56s)]
*  And people are seeing this. You know, look at look at January 6. Many of the people who [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  under January 6 had similar crimes to the women that chained themselves and writhed on the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  floor in the Hart office building protesting against Kavanaugh. They were trespassing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=327.68s)]
*  They were told to leave, didn't leave. And we've always treated trespassers like that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  as a form of speech. And their punishment was to be made to leave. Instead, with January [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  6, the punishment was jail. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=345.16s)]
*  As your doctor, I'm going to urge you to take a slight sip of water. Maybe have your own [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=348.08s)]
*  little Marco Rubio moment. Poor Marco will never play that down. It's unfair. But as [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=352.68s)]
*  an acting doctor on television, I say you might want to try Ricola for your throat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=360.0s)]
*  That's what I use. And it seems to work pretty well. But anyway, Senator, great to have you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=365.68s)]
*  Thanks for your analysis. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7edeQN7K4&t=369.76s)]
