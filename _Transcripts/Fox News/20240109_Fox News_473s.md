# Ted Cruz: I’m Chuck Schumer’s number one target
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us)
*  Joining us now, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, how are you? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  By the way, I'm watching your race closely. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=3.84s)]
*  That playbook is being played down in your state of Texas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=5.96s)]
*  Here you have been at the border again and again and again. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=10.4s)]
*  You gave this program exclusive images early on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  when in the middle of COVID, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=17.68s)]
*  when they wouldn't allow our cameras [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=19.8s)]
*  inside these facilities that had kids in cages [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=21.72s)]
*  overcrowded in the middle of a pandemic. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=25.04s)]
*  And if it wasn't for you, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  we wouldn't have had those photos. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=28.48s)]
*  And yet they're trying to bludgeon you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=30.64s)]
*  and lie about your record in Texas already? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=32.32s)]
*  Well, look, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  have painted a bull's eye on Texas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=37.84s)]
*  They're coming after me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Schumer has made clear I'm his number one target [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=42.56s)]
*  He's gonna spend over $100 million trying to beat me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  And so I wanna encourage your viewers, go to TedCruz.org, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=47.0s)]
*  TedCruz.org, TedCruz.org. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=50.24s)]
*  I need your help. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=52.08s)]
*  They're coming after me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=53.08s)]
*  I gotta say what is happening in Texas, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=54.28s)]
*  what is happening on the border, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=56.3s)]
*  it is a crisis at a level we have never seen before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=58.56s)]
*  As you noted, I spend a lot of time on the southern border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=62.56s)]
*  I go out on midnight patrol with the border patrol agents. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=65.64s)]
*  I went into the Biden cages [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=68.8s)]
*  when they wouldn't allow Fox News [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=70.32s)]
*  and they wouldn't allow reporters in. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=71.68s)]
*  Their argument, by the way, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=73.12s)]
*  when they wouldn't allow the reporters in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=74.3s)]
*  and the TV cameras in, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=75.8s)]
*  they said the TV cameraman might have COVID. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=77.08s)]
*  And so, as you know, I pulled out my phone [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  and filmed the conditions, the deplorable conditions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=82.08s)]
*  They tried to stop you, Senator. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=86.44s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=88.12s)]
*  They tried to stop you, a US Senator. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=89.36s)]
*  They didn't want the truth to come out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=91.96s)]
*  That they did not want, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=94.08s)]
*  you cannot see what's happening there and defend it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=95.2s)]
*  Last year, 853 migrants died [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=98.58s)]
*  crossing illegally into this country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=101.88s)]
*  You cannot see the children, as I've seen many times, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=103.72s)]
*  who've been horribly abused physically and sexually [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  by human traffickers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=110.24s)]
*  You can't see the women [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=111.32s)]
*  who've been violently sexually assaulted by human traffickers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=112.64s)]
*  You cannot defend it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=116.32s)]
*  Biden's entire strategy is hope the media ignores it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=117.88s)]
*  And by the way, in an exercise of chutzpah, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=121.88s)]
*  he stood up last week and said, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=125.36s)]
*  well, the problem is the Republicans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  won't fund border security. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=128.44s)]
*  What an utter lie. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=131.72s)]
*  are letting illegal immigrants into this country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=134.4s)]
*  They've created this problem. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=137.2s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Sean, there's an amazing phenomenon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=139.0s)]
*  Whatever the Democrats in the left wing accuse, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=142.12s)]
*  the other side of doing, it is what they're doing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=145.72s)]
*  You just showed Joe Biden giving a speech saying, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=148.96s)]
*  we must defend democracy, mind you, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=151.64s)]
*  at the exact same time that Democrats in Colorado and Maine [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=154.72s)]
*  are trying to prevent the voters [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=158.64s)]
*  from voting for Donald Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=160.4s)]
*  The most anti-democratic step we've seen in our lifetimes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=161.86s)]
*  All right, so, and the amazing thing is Mayorkas [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=165.8s)]
*  actually in the last week has blamed climate change, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=168.72s)]
*  blamed Greg Abbott, your governor, blamed you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=172.24s)]
*  Blamed Donald Trump for what's happening at the border. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=175.96s)]
*  And now they're claiming, well, Congress [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=178.68s)]
*  hasn't done their job. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  We need comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=181.62s)]
*  We didn't have this problem when Donald Trump was president. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=183.76s)]
*  We had the stay of Mexico policies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=186.48s)]
*  The walls were being built, hundreds of miles of them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=188.88s)]
*  And they all would have been completed by now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=191.74s)]
*  The border would have been secure. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=194.26s)]
*  None of this would have happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  What is their motivation? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=197.52s)]
*  Is their motivation to say, oh, we're the party, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=199.12s)]
*  we're gonna help you break the law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  If you or I did this, we'd go to jail. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=203.72s)]
*  We'll help you break the law. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=206.28s)]
*  We'll set you up in another state. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=207.6s)]
*  We'll give you free transportation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=209.06s)]
*  Maybe one day we'll give you citizenship [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  and we hope you remember us when you go vote. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=212.9s)]
*  Is that their plan? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  So I think that's a big part of it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=216.28s)]
*  I think there are really three motivations [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=217.68s)]
*  at play with the Democrats. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=219.46s)]
*  Number one, on every policy issue, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=220.62s)]
*  they've handed the agenda over to the radical left. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=223.34s)]
*  So on law and order, they've handed the agenda over [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=226.12s)]
*  to the radical abolish the police nuts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=228.4s)]
*  in the Democrat party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=230.72s)]
*  On Israel, they've handed the agenda over [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=232.08s)]
*  to the radical pro-Hamas nuts in their party, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=234.12s)]
*  the anti-Semites in their party. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  On issues of gender, they've handed the agenda [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=238.68s)]
*  over to the radical surgically mutilate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=241.24s)]
*  the children extremes in their party. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=244.3s)]
*  And on the border, they've handed the agenda [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  over to the extreme left that believes borders are immoral. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=249.08s)]
*  We should have no border. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=252.8s)]
*  Anyone should be able to come into this country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  That's who's setting the Biden administration agenda. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=256.36s)]
*  Number two, the corporate media is utterly corrupt. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=259.24s)]
*  So they don't report on it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=262.44s)]
*  If you watch Fox News, as you and I both do, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=263.56s)]
*  you know about what's happening on the border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  But if you watch CNN, there is no border crisis. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=267.68s)]
*  ABC, CBS, NBC, nothing to see here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=270.6s)]
*  And number three, it's what you just said. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=273.56s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats know [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=275.88s)]
*  there's massive human suffering, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=277.56s)]
*  but they're willing to overlook that human suffering [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=279.86s)]
*  because they wanna stay in power. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=282.16s)]
*  They look at the 9.6 million illegal immigrants [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=283.36s)]
*  and they think every one of them [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=286.24s)]
*  is a future Democrat voter. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=287.92s)]
*  And we get to stay in power if we change the electorate [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=290.0s)]
*  and just allow open borders. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=293.68s)]
*  And I gotta say, Sean, the most dangerous thing, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=295.2s)]
*  I believe the odds are extraordinarily high [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=297.88s)]
*  that in the year 2024, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=300.38s)]
*  we will see a major terrorist attack in the United States. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=302.48s)]
*  There Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=306.44s)]
*  coming across our southern border right now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  And Joe Biden and the Democrats in the House and Senate, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  they do not care. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=314.68s)]
*  Well, we know that the possibility, I say it's 100%. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=316.56s)]
*  We know that we've had hundreds from Iran [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=320.34000000000003s)]

*  what are you doing at our southern border? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=327.82s)]
*  Thousands from Egypt, the home of the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=329.52s)]
*  6,000 plus from Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=333.52s)]
*  We got over 12,000 from Russia, 26,000 from China. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=337.12s)]
*  Now, let me be very clear, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=340.86s)]
*  because Democrats say they're racist. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  They don't want people of color coming into the country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=343.92s)]
*  I don't care where people come, but I'd like people vetted. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=346.32s)]
*  I'd like to know they don't have radical associations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=349.44s)]
*  I'd like to know that they're healthy, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=352.04s)]
*  especially in a pandemic world, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  post-pandemic world we're living in. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=355.68s)]
*  And I'd like to know there not gonna be a financial burden [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  on the American people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=359.8s)]

*  Let me give you some stats on the terror watch list. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=367.72s)]
*  In fiscal year 2017, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=370.62s)]
*  two people were encountered on the border [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=373.06s)]
*  on the terror watch list. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=375.22s)]
*  In 2018, six. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=376.76s)]
*  In 2019, zero. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=379.3s)]
*  In 2020, two. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=382.1s)]
*  In fiscal year 2021, most of which Trump was president, 15. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=383.94s)]
*  What happened the next year, fiscal year 2022? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=389.18s)]
*  98. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=392.94s)]
*  What happened the next year, fiscal year 23? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=395.14s)]
*  172. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=398.02s)]
*  And we went from zero and two to 172. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=401.34s)]
*  And those are the ones we know about. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=405.22s)]
*  That doesn't count the two million gotaways last year [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=406.66s)]
*  that pose a dramatic threat. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=410.14s)]
*  This administration is endangering the safety [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=413.9s)]
*  of every American because they do not know [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=416.66s)]
*  what terrorists are coming into this border. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=419.3s)]
*  And they're willing to say, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=421.06s)]
*  we wanna stay in power more [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=422.46s)]
*  than we wanna keep your family safe. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=424.3s)]
*  If they allowed terrorists in, and we're right, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=427.22s)]
*  and I don't think we're wrong. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=429.44s)]
*  I pray to God we're wrong, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=430.56s)]
*  but I don't think we're gonna be proven wrong. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  I wanna be wrong. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=432.96s)]
*  If there, I wanna be wrong. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=434.4s)]
*  If there are terror cells, as we believe there are, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=435.84s)]
*  and I think there has to be the sheer numbers, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=438.68s)]
*  mathematically, it is just statistically right there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=441.52s)]
*  And if you were Hamas commander, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=445.04s)]
*  why wouldn't you send someone in? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=446.6s)]
*  I mean, it's screaming for it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=448.48s)]
*  They will have blood on their hands [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=451.1s)]
*  because they have allowed this to happen. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=453.24s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=456.04s)]
*  And by the way, they are targeting Senator Cruz big time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=457.32s)]
*  We'll be following that closely. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEuFlqLw6Us&t=459.91999999999996s)]
