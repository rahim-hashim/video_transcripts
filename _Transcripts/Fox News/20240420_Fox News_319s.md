# Vivek Ramaswamy: Trump's prosecutions are backfiring
**Fox News:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q)
*  with reaction, his former 2020 Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's get your reaction to the polls. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=5.18s)]
*  I've always said, Vivek, that Donald Trump defies all conventional political gravity, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=7.38s)]
*  because as the harder they attack him—and people can see how—are witnessing right [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=13.74s)]
*  before their eyes the unfairness unfolding in that courtroom in New York, it seems that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  it is not impacting the American people at all. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=25.92s)]
*  It is having the opposite effect, and they've pretty much done the impossible. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  They've taken that strong public figure, Donald Trump, and have pretty much turned [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=33.12s)]
*  him into a victim of a weaponized system of justice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=37.68s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=40.8s)]
*  Well, my reaction is, the people of this country are seeing through Biden's hypocrisy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=43.8s)]
*  On one hand, he campaigned on bringing decency to politics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  On the other hand, his people are now invoking Hitler to compare Donald Trump to him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=51.36s)]
*  He said he was going to turn down the temperature in American politics. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Yet now we see the Democratic Party effectively leading multiple prosecutions against the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=58.4s)]
*  lead opponent in the middle of an election. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=62.96s)]
*  So I think we're seeing through that hypocrisy, and every one of these prosecutions, I think [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=65.36s)]
*  Sean is backfiring. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=69.16s)]
*  People are sick and tired of being lied to. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=70.98s)]
*  They're sick and tired of the lawfare. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=73.0s)]
*  I actually talked to many Democrats who disagree with Donald Trump on many policies, but believe [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=74.6s)]
*  that we're not a country where you're supposed to use the prosecutorial power to eliminate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=79.52s)]
*  your opponents. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=83.6s)]
*  So I think many independents and many Democrats are actually coming along. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=84.84s)]
*  They know if you can do it to Trump today, they can do it to them tomorrow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=88.52s)]
*  And we need to put an end to that and restore the rule of law in this country and clean [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  up that weaponization of government. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's a message that many independents are rallying behind, and I think it's going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=97.32s)]
*  to work in Donald Trump's favor, and that's for the better of our country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, a couple of things I'll say about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=104.8s)]
*  When I interviewed him, I liked him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=108.44s)]
*  I don't agree with him, but I thought he was sincere. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  I think he's been treated horribly by the Democrats. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=113.0s)]
*  Now his own family is turning against him. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=116.36s)]
*  And you know, the effort to smear him is coming really from within his own party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=119.56s)]
*  And I find that very interesting, and I really think it's wrong that the fact that his [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=126.46s)]
*  uncle and his father were assassinated, and he is a viable candidate, that Joe Biden will [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=130.6s)]
*  not allow the Secret Service protection that I would argue he deserves. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=137.44s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=141.04s)]
*  Look, I agree with that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=144.04s)]
*  I also agree with the Democratic Party effectively not tolerating any dissent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=145.92s)]
*  He actually started as a Democrat, ended up running as an independent. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=148.76s)]
*  I disagree with him on a lot of things when it comes to policy, from Second Amendment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=152.16s)]
*  rights to climate change policies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=155.04s)]
*  We disagree on the substance of a lot of things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=157.04s)]
*  But I respect somebody who can still call out that weaponization of government and stand [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  for free speech and open debate in this country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=163.16s)]
*  There's something not only Robert F. Kennedy, but many independents in this country stand [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=166.0s)]
*  for. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  I think we need two sets of mass deportations in this country, Sean, and Donald Trump stands [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  for both of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=174.52s)]
*  One is the mass deportation of illegals who are in this country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=175.68s)]
*  We need to deport millions of them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=178.96s)]
*  But we also need to deport millions of federal bureaucrats out of that Washington, D.C. bureaucracy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=180.68s)]
*  And I think there's one candidate who's positioned to deliver that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  That's Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=189.0s)]
*  And I think that we can make sure as a country that that second term is even more successful [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=190.0s)]
*  than the successful first term. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=194.88s)]
*  That's where I think we're headed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=196.84s)]
*  I'm hopeful for a landslide victory that unites this country, and that's what we need to fight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=198.12s)]
*  for. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=201.4s)]
*  It looks like Kennedy, I think, has a good shot in getting on the ballot in all 50 states. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=202.88s)]
*  But he supported Bernie Sanders' climate plan to curb fossil fuel extraction, Obama's decision [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=208.12s)]
*  to cancel a fossil fuel auction, hashtag Keep It In The Ground, a common theme of his, or [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=214.72s)]
*  the decision to ban fossil fuel extraction in San Francisco and Maryland's ban on fracking, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, calling the NRA a terror group, supporting the Paris climate agreement [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=227.64s)]
*  that classifies China and India as developing nations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=234.0s)]
*  He supports affirmative action. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=238.12s)]
*  He wants, for example, he believes in this reimagining the police, incentivizing them, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=239.92s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=246.72s)]
*  And you know, once called Louis Farrakhan a truly great partner. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=248.56s)]
*  He seems to take on all of the radical positions of the New Green Deal Democrats. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=253.56s)]
*  However, why has he been treated so poorly by his fellow Democrats? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=258.8s)]
*  Well, as I said, Sean, I disagree with RFK Jr. on a lot of subjects. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=264.32s)]
*  I think I would not vote for him for U.S. president for all range of policy disagreements. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=269.76s)]
*  That being said, I think he's speaking the truth on certain hard subjects that the Democratic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=274.58s)]
*  untouchable third rails from the reality of COVID policies in this country to government [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=279.64s)]
*  tech censorship. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=284.24s)]
*  But the reality is there's one right answer to that question. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=285.32s)]
*  We need Donald Trump to have a second term and we need to take that America first agenda [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=288.44s)]
*  to the next level, ending the collusion between big tech and government actors to be able [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=292.56s)]
*  to censor speech through the back door, restore the principles this country was founded on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  That's how we're going to win. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=302.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=303.12s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, as always, thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzQv9RLNE0Q&t=304.12s)]
