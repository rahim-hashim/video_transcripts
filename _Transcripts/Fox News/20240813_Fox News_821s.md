# Sean Hannity: We are watching an illusion
**Fox News:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight we are less than one week away from the Democratic National [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=0.0s)]
*  Convention in Chicago, Illinois, where party leaders will officially nominate a candidate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=5.88s)]
*  who received 0 percent of the primary votes after party elites involved in a coup completely [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=10.82s)]
*  disenfranchised Democratic primary voters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=17.52s)]
*  But not long ago, Kamala Harris was persona non grata in the Democratic Party and among [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=20.96s)]
*  so-called journalists in the state-run Pravda Media Mob. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  This is a November 2022 headline. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=30.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=33.8s)]
*  Not exactly a conservative publication at Slate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=34.8s)]
*  Quote, if Biden runs again, he should pick a new VP. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=37.2s)]
*  And this from New York Magazine a year later, 2023. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=41.64s)]
*  Quote, the case for Biden to drop Kamala Harris. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=44.84s)]
*  Here's another headline. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Politico. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Quote, columnists call for Biden to drop Harris and pick a new running mate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Kamala was routinely mocked on both sides of the aisle, eminent in the media, for her [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=56.32s)]
*  embarrassing word salads about the passage of time, etc. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=61.32s)]
*  And anyway, her poll numbers were consistently at or near record lows. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=67.0s)]
*  I expect they will be again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=71.88s)]
*  Kamala's own staff reportedly hated her, ridiculed the vice president's work ethic [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=73.72s)]
*  and character, and her track record as border czar and on inflation, and Afghanistan is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  devastating. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Now she's the second coming. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=85.24s)]
*  You turn on the TV, you pick up a newspaper, Democrats, their mouthpieces in the media. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=86.64s)]
*  Well, they're not telling us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's the rapture. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  A competent, likable person, full of joy and hope and unburdened by the past and what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=97.44s)]
*  has been. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=103.74s)]
*  Four years of complete incompetence, automatically replaced with fresh new ideas and very moderate [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  She almost sounds like me, conservative. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  The entire Harris campaign, the whole thing America needs to understand. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=114.68s)]
*  What we are watching is an illusion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=119.22s)]
*  It is a lie. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=121.68s)]
*  It's built on a mountain of lies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=122.68s)]
*  If anyone in the media mob told the truth about who Kamala Harris and her running mate, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=124.8s)]
*  who they are, and they played their extremism in their own words, and people were fully [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  informed about what she truly believes, what she has said she believes, the vice president [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=136.48s)]
*  would lose in a landslide this November. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=142.2s)]
*  In 2019, she couldn't even make it to Iowa in the Democratic primary. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=144.72s)]
*  She was too radical, too extreme, even for Democratic primary voters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=149.32s)]
*  Now, think about this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=153.16s)]
*  As a candidate for president, she vowed to ban fracking, offshore drilling. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=154.8s)]
*  She promised to confiscate guns, mandatory gun buyback program from all of you, law-abiding [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=159.88s)]
*  American citizens, and end cash bail for those that broke the law. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  She cosponsored to Socialist $93 trillion Green New Deal in the U.S. Senate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=170.32s)]
*  She was the sponsor and promised to ram that through Congress and, you know, buyâ€”use [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=176.56s)]
*  the filibuster and get rid of that and change the rules. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=181.56s)]
*  She also promised to decriminalize the illegal immigration, force you to cover the bill for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=185.1s)]
*  healthcare, housing, food, education, for anybody that enters our country illegally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=190.72s)]
*  She's been commonly even cosponsored to Medicare for All bill with our fellow socialist [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=196.24s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and declared that she would eliminate all private health insurance. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=201.0s)]
*  I know, you think I make this up, I don't. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=206.24s)]
*  Here's her inner oral words. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=209.96s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=211.56s)]
*  How important is it to your healthcare plan to get rid of private insurance companies? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=212.56s)]
*  Because there's some confusion about that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm glad you asked. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=219.24s)]
*  So the bottom line and the most important is that everyone have access to healthcare. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=223.36s)]
*  That is the goal, that is the purpose for me supporting the policy of Medicare for All. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  If Congress votes in a way that reflects the values and the desires of the American people, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=234.28s)]
*  then Congress would vote for a policy that gives everyone access to healthcare. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  In other words, Kamala Harris wanted to model our healthcare system after Cuba and North [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=245.24s)]
*  Korea. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Does Kamala Harris still want to take away all private health insurance? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=252.04s)]
*  Does she still want to turn your healthcare system into a single-payer, government-run [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=255.32s)]
*  hellscape? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=260.12s)]
*  By the way, how's that Keep Your Doctor Plan and save, on average, $2,500 a year working? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=261.12s)]
*  Millions of Americans lost their doctors and their plans and nobody's saving money. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=267.08s)]
*  You're paying about 300 percent more. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=272.28s)]
*  On top of the promise of Social Security and Medicare, they're both headed towards insolvency. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=274.52s)]
*  How's that post office working out for you? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=280.5s)]
*  Anyway, probably she's not going to say what sheâ€”she won't say what she believes or [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=282.7s)]
*  even list a position on her website instead of campaign aid. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=286.82s)]
*  We keep hearing from these anonymous campaign aides of Kamala Harris indicating off-camera [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=291.66s)]
*  that she won't now push for Medicare for All, another flip-flop flail. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  And meanwhile, we know if we tell you the truth about her real beliefs, she would have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  no chance of winning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  So they will try to lie their way to the presidency with the help of the media mob [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=309.86s)]
*  and hide behind anonymous campaign aides. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  And Kamala has suddenly now backed away from nearly every single left-wing radical position [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=320.54s)]
*  she has deeply held. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=325.7s)]
*  She can't win being who she is. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  So they've got to get rid of all that stuff, all the things she actually said and believes [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=329.54s)]
*  and would do if she ever gets power. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  Again, Democrats know Kamala will lose in a landslide if their candidate were to be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=337.42s)]
*  honest about who she truly is and what she truly believes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=342.34s)]
*  But it's not only her radical, extreme, dangerous beliefs that Democrats are trying to memory-hole [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=347.2s)]
*  here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=354.9s)]
*  It's also her horrific track record. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=355.9s)]
*  Everywhere Kamala has gone, failure and suffering has followed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=358.62s)]
*  The vice president now says that she will bring down the cost on day one and get rid [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=362.82s)]
*  of inflation on day one. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=367.96s)]
*  Only problem is, day one was over 1,300 days ago, and she was telling us inflation is transitory [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=370.58s)]
*  like everybody else. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=376.76s)]
*  Now, she is the second-in-command. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=378.05999999999995s)]
*  She's the vice president of the country. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=380.82s)]
*  She played a very important role in policy decisions. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  She even gleefully cast the tie-breaking vote in that massive government spending bill, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=391.38s)]
*  Remember, without her, it doesn't pass. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=393.26s)]
*  And that's paid for in part with taxes from TIPS on other low-income and service workers [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=395.58s)]
*  around the country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=402.3s)]
*  Now, she says she's going to get rid of taxing TIPS. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=403.3s)]
*  If Kamala really wanted to end taxes on TIPS, well, why did she single-handedly increase [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=406.5s)]
*  them in office? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  Kamala caused inflation, along with Joe, and in three years, she has utterly failed to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=413.54s)]
*  bring any prices down, and now Americans, they are suffering. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=418.24s)]
*  Half the country now is gulping water, pretty much basically unable to pay their bills every [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=423.0s)]
*  month. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=428.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=429.88s)]
*  How hard has inflation hit you? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=430.88s)]
*  It hit me hard. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=431.88s)]
*  It's hitting me hard. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=432.88s)]
*  What do you blame for it? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=433.88s)]
*  I blame the federal government at this point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=436.0s)]
*  If a working-class mom who works as a paralegal cannot buy a $2 bell pepper because it's now [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=438.2s)]
*  5, imagine a mother living on a food stamps. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=446.0s)]
*  Imagine a mother who's making minimum wage trying to feed children. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=450.12s)]

*  They're killing us without telling us they're killing us. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=462.48s)]

*  Remember, Kamala's the border czar, or at least that's what the media was calling her [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=484.15999999999997s)]

*  the U.S. through an insane Biden-Harris program that helps illegals bypass the border. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=570.56s)]
*  After all, it was beginning to look too bad, and they were taking a lot of heat for it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=578.16s)]
*  Let's sneak them in in the dark at night and fly them into obscure airports in the country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=582.52s)]
*  This illegal immigrant was released on a $500 bond by a left-wing radical judge before getting [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=588.76s)]

*  Why didn't she fix it the last four years? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=622.84s)]
*  Why did she lie and say the border's closed and the border's secure? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=624.84s)]
*  Why did Mayorkas lie? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=628.84s)]

*  law enforcement. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=646.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris in law enforcement in California, we're very familiar with her and how she [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=647.96s)]
*  has done over the course of years as a senator and as a prosecutor and as the attorney general. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=652.2s)]
*  And I can tell you that this ad is deceiving, to say the least. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  For me in law enforcement, to see my face and image along with my law enforcement counterparts [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=663.08s)]
*  being represented as standing alongside Kamala Harris was truly disheartening. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=668.04s)]
*  We do not support Kamala Harris. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=673.28s)]
*  She has a history of not supporting law enforcement. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=674.96s)]
*  Now, as Senator Cotton tweeted, quote, Kamala Harris promising to secure the border is like [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=677.56s)]
*  O.J. Simpson promising to find the real killer on the golf course, I'll add. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Everything about Kamala's campaign, it is a lie. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=688.16s)]
*  Everything is a deception. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=691.72s)]
*  It's all smoke. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=693.2s)]
*  It's all mirrors, because she can't win being herself. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=694.2s)]
*  The Harris campaign is even, quote, editing news headlines. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  And descriptions within Google search ads to make it seem like major news organizations [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=703.36s)]
*  support her? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=709.6s)]
*  Now, Democrats were deeply worried about misinformation. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=710.88s)]
*  I thought they cared about dignity and democracy being in peril. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=714.64s)]
*  But here they are nominating a candidate without a single vote, using misinformation [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=718.66s)]
*  and deception to prop up their anointed one. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=723.38s)]
*  Anyway, according to reports, they don't even want Hollywood elites at the DNC, despite [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=726.62s)]
*  close ties to Harris. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=731.5s)]

*  They don't want you to see who she really is, who she's really friends with. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=734.66s)]
*  How many times have I said the Democratic Party has become the party of coastal elites? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=739.54s)]
*  And they don't represent hardworking men and women anymore. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=744.18s)]
*  If they did, they wouldn't allow chaos on the border. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=747.18s)]
*  If they did, they would support law and order and safety and security and not, you know, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=749.62s)]
*  defund, dismantle, no bail laws. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=754.66s)]
*  They would support energy independence, so you pay less for your energy costs. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=756.88s)]
*  They would support, you know, sane economic policies that didn't take so much money out [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=762.12s)]
*  of your pocket. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=766.62s)]
*  Have some self-respect, Kamala. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=768.16s)]
*  Tell the American people, you know, do an interview, do a gaggle, do a press conference. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=770.2199999999999s)]

*  Anything less is only a glaring admission. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=790.98s)]
*  You are not capable. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=794.42s)]
*  You are too radical to be president. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=796.1s)]
*  And the mission, I would argue, for the Trump campaign, if they want to win, they better [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=798.66s)]
*  get this message out loudly. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYCe5k_oVw&t=802.18s)]
