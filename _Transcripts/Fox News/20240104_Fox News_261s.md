# Jim Jordan: Biden was determined to create this crisis
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM)
*  All right, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris have no interest, apparently, to fix the border crisis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=0.0s)]
*  they themselves created. But the House Republicans, they are now determined to take action. A group [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=4.48s)]
*  of more than 60 GOP members led by the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, they did visit the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=9.84s)]
*  border today to see things for themselves. By the way, something Biden and Kamala Harris may want to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=15.44s)]
*  do. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan was on that trip earlier today. He joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=20.16s)]
*  So we have all these budgetary battles that are upcoming. And to me, there are two huge priorities [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  that the Republicans, well, three, actually, the Republicans need to take on. One is the border, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  because I believe it is a clear present danger, especially with all the people coming from Iran, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=37.36s)]
*  Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Russia and China. The next issue, I think, is of great importance, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=42.88s)]
*  is getting the $34 trillion under control spending. And the third thing would be your [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=49.36s)]
*  investigation. Will those things happen this election year? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=54.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think they will, Sean, and you're right. You not only see the problem here. Eight out of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=60.96s)]
*  10 Americans know that the border situation is a crisis. They also, I think, understand the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=64.72s)]
*  magnitude of it. They think it's a crisis because it is 300,000 last month, highest month on record, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=70.64s)]
*  Sean. And the pace we're on under Joe Biden, his administration, the pace we're on, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=76.16s)]
*  we will hit 12 million migrants coming into the country in four years. That is why we just got to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=80.8s)]
*  stop. The plan should be no more migrants come into the country, unless there's some extenuating [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  circumstances for an individual. No new migrants should be allowed in the country. One sentence, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=91.84s)]
*  I think, will do it. And that sentence is, do not spend American tax dollars to process or release [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  into the country any new migrant. That's what we've got to try to get on every single piece [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=101.92s)]
*  of legislation that we can and force Joe Biden to do the right thing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=106.24s)]
*  So Joe Biden, we know since he's been president, by eliminating the policies of Donald Trump that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  were working, we now, he allowed 8.3 million people now crossing that border, all pretty much [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=116.24s)]
*  unvetted, including some of very hostile regimes towards this country, some of our biggest [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=123.52s)]
*  geopolitical foes. Didn't Joe Biden take an oath to uphold the laws of our land, our constitution? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=129.52s)]
*  Every law is based on that document. If I were to, is a president now allowed to just pick and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=137.2s)]
*  choose what laws they'll enforce? Is a president allowed to aid in a bet in the law breaking by [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=144.8s)]
*  offering free transportation? Our governors are allowed to offer free healthcare like is now being [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=150.24s)]
*  offered in states like California, forcing taxpayers to pay for people that entered the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=155.76s)]
*  country illegally. Is that now our future? No, you're exactly right. When Joe Biden took the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  oath of office on January 20th, 2021, he's supposed to then go enforce the law. Instead, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=166.32s)]
*  what he did that very day, Sean, is he issued a number of executive orders and he changed policy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=171.76s)]
*  He said, no more building the wall, no more remain in Mexico while we evaluate an asylum [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=176.0s)]
*  seekers claim. And he also said, once you come to the country, you will be released to wherever [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=180.64s)]
*  you want to go. All across our nation, people are going and everyone understands. That is why I think [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  the American people know that this is deliberate. This is willful. This is purposeful. He did this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  He was determined to do this and the country understands just how wrong it is. That's why [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=198.72s)]
*  I think you're seeing the 80% polling numbers that show something has to be done. And what [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=204.48s)]
*  I think has to be done is he's not going to pass the bill. If he's not going to pass our bill, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=210.72s)]
*  then he should do that once we should do that one sentence and put it on legislation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=214.64s)]
*  Will mayorkas be impeached? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  I think we're always driven by the facts and the evidence. I think the facts and the evidence are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  pretty darn compelling for him. I also think the evidence is compelling for Joe Biden. That's why [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=228.0s)]
*  we've actually entered an impeachment inquiry phase, took a vote on impeachment inquiry, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=232.96s)]
*  and are moving forward with the witnesses, the final witnesses we needed to pose before we make [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=237.12s)]
*  a determination. But I think the facts and the evidence are already compelling for both individuals. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=241.68s)]
*  Jim Jordan, thank you so much as always. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx0uk8JaAvM&t=247.12s)]
