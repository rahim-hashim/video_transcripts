# Kayleigh McEnany: Itâ€™s a sad state of affairs for Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc)
*  Meanwhile, according to a new report, Biden has another pair of new shoes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=0.0s)]
*  They're designed to give Joey even more stability after a number of, well, embarrassing stumbles [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=4.2s)]
*  and the fact that he had to give up the big boy stares to Air Force One for, well, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=10.8s)]
*  little boy stares in the back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=15.48s)]
*  Here with reaction, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, outnumbered co-host Kayleigh [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  McEnany. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=21.52s)]
*  Kayleigh, all right, I don't think the new sneakers are there, but this is where I see [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=22.52s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=26.78s)]
*  I'm with John Fox and Friends this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=27.78s)]
*  And by the way, I'm sure they're going to run my montage from the last segment, because [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=30.020000000000003s)]
*  if they don't, I have to buy them all dinner, which I don't really want to do if I don't [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=34.5s)]
*  have to. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  But Kayleigh, here's his problem. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  His base is leaving him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=43.1s)]
*  He's lost over 20 percent of the African-American vote. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  Hispanic Americans, it's almost a dead heat between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=48.34s)]
*  That's a win for Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=53.38s)]
*  If you look at young people, they're not interested in a cranky, old, confused president [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=55.7s)]
*  that has no energy at all whatsoever, unless, of course, he's jacked up on Red Bull and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=60.46s)]
*  caffeine or maybe something else. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=65.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=68.06s)]
*  I wouldn't venture a guess. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=69.06s)]
*  However, they're losing their base. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=71.34s)]
*  They're bleeding the base. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=73.5s)]
*  What does Joe do at this point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=74.92s)]
*  Yeah, you nailed it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=77.06s)]
*  What's really interesting, Sean, I think if you took a look at the Biden internal polls [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  right now, you would not only see him doing poorly among the groups you just named, which [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  he has to do well among, but I think you would see a mutiny among progressives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  I think it is worse than what any of us know, because that's the only way you explain the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  actions we're seeing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=99.44s)]
*  It's the only way you explain Kamala Harris going to an abortion clinic, the first vice [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=100.5s)]
*  president ever to do so. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  It's the only way you explain a state of the union that is fever pitch, that is angry, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=106.94s)]
*  that is red meat for the base. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=111.7s)]
*  It's the only way you explain a president who has been around a long time, who knows [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  about hot mics, who sends a message to Bibi Netanyahu and a message to progressives on [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=118.76s)]
*  Gaza by calling out Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=123.78s)]
*  It's the only reason you have a White House that has a marijuana summit, which is what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=126.2s)]
*  they had last week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=129.68s)]
*  They are hemorrhaging the far left. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  And in an effort to get the far left back, they are pushing away independence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=135.24s)]
*  So they're in this interesting pull push conundrum. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=139.46s)]
*  They're trying to pull the progressives in because they know they got to have them, but [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=142.8s)]
*  I think they're losing the Nikki Haley voter, the independent voter, the soft Democrat in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=145.9s)]
*  the process. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=150.18s)]
*  You know, I think Haley makes a lot of good points here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=151.18s)]
*  You've got Kamala Harris showing up, governor, at an abortion clinic, then inviting, you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=154.38s)]
*  know, the weed lobby, the legalized weed lobby to the White House and having a big event [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=160.14s)]
*  with them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=165.78s)]
*  Follow that up with, you know, everything else that they've been doing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=167.34s)]
*  It seems like every decision now is about them bleeding their base and trying to bring [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=170.78s)]
*  them home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=176.74s)]
*  And then the last, and I think the most important issue, is what Haley said, too, about their [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=180.14s)]
*  treatment of our closest ally in the Middle East, and that's Israel and Prime Minister [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=183.86s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=189.14s)]
*  The only reason Schumer and Biden call for elections in Israel after the worst terror [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=190.34s)]
*  history while they're in a fight for their survival is because they were bleeding voters. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  18.9 percent of people in Michigan wouldn't vote for Joe in the primary over that one [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=202.78s)]
*  issue. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=208.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=209.38s)]
*  That speaks volumes about his character. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=210.38s)]
*  Their bigger problem is they're trying to sell something nobody wants. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=214.42s)]
*  I mean, this is like trying to sell buckets of chicken at a vegan convention. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  It's just not going over. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=222.78s)]
*  I mean, the fact is, when you try to go and pretend that you suddenly really don't like [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=224.3s)]
*  Israel, well, you do two things. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=229.1s)]
*  You offend all the people who do look at Israel as the real ally and look at Hamas as a group [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=231.66s)]
*  of terrorist butchers, and you can't side with one or the other, and you start trying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=237.68s)]
*  to pretend that maybe Israel ought to have an election. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=242.9s)]
*  Maybe what Israel ought to do is to just say, you know what, we're not going to have a two-state [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=245.22s)]
*  solution. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=249.66s)]
*  Not now, not ever. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=250.66s)]
*  And we're going to build communities for our families to live securely in Judea and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=251.78s)]
*  Samaria, and we're going to step those efforts up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=255.86s)]
*  And a smart U.S. politician would say, bravo, we're with you 100 percent, because if you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=258.66s)]
*  do anything else, you have rewarded Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=263.86s)]
*  Joe's trying to have it both ways. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=266.78s)]
*  And when you try to please everybody, you end up pleasing nobody, and everyone turns [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=268.66s)]
*  against you, and his poll numbers reflect that right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=274.06s)]
*  And how dumb is this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=277.7s)]
*  This is aâ€”this was a terrorist attack. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=279.1s)]
*  Extrapolate out the population and compare it to the American population. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=282.54s)]
*  Kayleigh, it would be the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans in a day. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=286.5s)]
*  We lost 2,977 Americans on September 11th, and because of 9-11-related illness, many [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=292.1s)]
*  thousands thereafter. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=300.82s)]
*  And how would we feel if, you know, our allies turned on us this way? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  They're not even asking for boots on the ground. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=308.86s)]
*  They're not even asking for money. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=311.06s)]
*  They said they would buy the weapons from us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=312.94s)]
*  That's all they want. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=315.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Sean, it's hard to hear, but babies were put in ovens. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=316.42s)]
*  That happened. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  A young boy, one-year-old Kefir Bebus, his brother Ariel, still in the hands of terrorists. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  They're out there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=330.18s)]
*  Who knows where they are this evening alongside their mom and their dad? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=331.74s)]
*  These are real people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=335.22s)]
*  They have names. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=336.22s)]
*  And Biden said it all when he told Israel, control your rage. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=337.22s)]
*  You can't have it both ways. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=342.5s)]
*  He stood on principle with Israel, and then he's seething when the political repercussions [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=343.94s)]
*  are losing progressives. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=348.62s)]
*  It's a sad state of affairs for Joe Biden, but stick with the innocent. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  Stand up for the innocent. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=354.06s)]
*  Stand with our democratic friends in the Middle East. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=355.06s)]
*  What's the point of fighting war, Governor, if you're not fighting it to win it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=358.34s)]
*  Well, you're not only fighting to win it, you fight it on the right side. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=362.26s)]
*  It's horrible that civilians have died in Gaza, but the reason they've died is because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=366.34s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=369.94s)]
*  And let's not forget something. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=370.94s)]
*  We have American citizens being held hostage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  Be nice if Schumer and Biden would be talking about the Americans being held hostage. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=374.73999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for reminding America, Governor. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  America needs to remember that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=382.26s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7knDMUpkfc&t=384.21999999999997s)]
