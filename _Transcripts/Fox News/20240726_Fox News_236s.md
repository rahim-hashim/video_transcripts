# Hannity: This is the biggest lie, cover-up campaign of all time
**Fox News:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A)
*  All right, joining us now, Project 21 chairman Horace Cooper is with us, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Concha. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=5.04s)]
*  Horace, start with you tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=6.04s)]
*  Let's get your take on Kamala Harris. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The vetting has begun, her in her own words, as radical a person to ever run for the presidency. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=10.48s)]
*  Well, she absolutely is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=16.56s)]
*  She has demonstrated how unpopular her views are. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=19.84s)]
*  She ran for president even when we were talking about a large number of left wingers running. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=23.44s)]
*  She was one of the first, not one of, she was the first to end up dropping off. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  She didn't make it to the first primary. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=36.72s)]
*  Her views are far out of the mainstream. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  And when she was named the running mate, we saw something very interesting, a negative [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  bounce by the Biden-Harris ticket when she was first named, and largely because a number [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=49.22s)]
*  of black Americans were watching her when she was in California and they didn't approve. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=56.06s)]
*  Nothing has changed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=61.7s)]
*  You know, Joe, I think it's the biggest lie cover-up campaign of all time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=63.94s)]
*  I mean, look at all the lies Kamala Harris has told us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=67.74s)]
*  She's not, why the big push and all the media's jumping on board that she was not the border's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=70.78s)]
*  are? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=76.14s)]
*  The media, I had a point today, they use the exact words that she was in charge of the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=77.3s)]
*  border at the time that Joe Biden tasked her with that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=83.26s)]
*  And now they want everybody to deny it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=87.7s)]
*  The media falls right in line as per usual. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=89.92s)]
*  The same people, Sean, who said the Steele dossier was absolutely real, that actually [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=94.3s)]
*  Joe Biden falling down and saying all the things that he said, they were cheap fake [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=98.68s)]
*  videos, edited, manipulated. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=102.38s)]
*  And now they're telling you, no, actually Kamala Harris wasn't in charge of the border. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=104.5s)]
*  Borders are, what's that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  And all these talking points, all the spin the world by our hopelessly corrupt legacy [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=109.55999999999999s)]
*  media Sean, cannot change the fact that if you're giving out grades, as far as performance [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  of securing the border and finding the root causes of mass illegal migration, Kamala Harris, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=119.3s)]
*  who was put in charge of it, there's no question about that, she gets whatever is below an [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=125.33999999999999s)]
*  F- as a grade. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=128.66s)]
*  It's not just the border, Sean. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=130.5s)]
*  I mean, you tell me how voters in Pennsylvania are going to like it when they hear that Kamala [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=131.82000000000002s)]
*  Harris has publicly stated that she supports banning, fracking or ending the fossil fuel [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=136.10000000000002s)]
*  industry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Those are her words. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  They're all on video. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  How about in Michigan? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  She supports government mandated EV sales, phasing out gas powered cars. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=146.18s)]
*  That would result in thousands of jobs lost in the auto industry. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  How are Michigan voters going to feel about that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=154.86s)]
*  Oh, how about border states like Arizona, New Mexico? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  How are they going to feel about the fact that Kamala Harris has declared that she wants [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=160.06s)]
*  to abolish ICE? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=162.86s)]
*  She wants compared ICE to the KKK. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=165.18s)]
*  She has said that illegal border crossings actually should be made legal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  Again, pain is temporary, film is forever and it's all on there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  How are voters across the nation going to feel when they see their gas prices that have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=175.9s)]
*  gone up more than 50% since Donald Trump left office, that she's all for banning offshore [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=179.78s)]
*  drilling? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=184.62s)]
*  How are they going to feel when they hear that she wanted to eliminate private health [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  insurance? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=189.7s)]
*  Oh, you need that emergency procedure? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=190.7s)]
*  Take a number, wait six months, maybe it'll work out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=191.7s)]
*  Ask people living in Canada and England how that goes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=194.62s)]
*  Over and over again, Sean, there are many examples here all on video that the media [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=196.94s)]
*  needs to point out and they won't in an effort to try to get her over the finish line. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  It ain't going to work because of shows like this and of social media, Sean. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and 18 to 24 year olds are stupid, but we do put advanced weapons in their hands, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=207.94s)]
*  send them in the combat. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, they're not living in dorms. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  They're living in submarines and aircraft carriers or driving. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=216.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=220.62s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=221.62s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=222.62s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CP2RhNf2A&t=223.62s)]
