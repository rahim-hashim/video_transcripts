# Ari Fleischer: Dave McCormick was more ‘in tune’ with the state after Pa. Senate win
**Fox News:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE)
*  to President Trump, Stephen Miller, and former White House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=0.0s)]
*  Ari, you are very invested. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  You know Dave McCormick personally. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=6.36s)]
*  That was always going to be a tough race. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=8.88s)]
*  It was a tough race. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=11.0s)]
*  He beat a career politician. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=12.56s)]
*  Huge pickup for Republicans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=17.88s)]
*  Why did it happen? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=18.88s)]
*  Well, and I should disclose, I actually did work on that campaign. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=19.88s)]
*  It happened, Sean, because the people of Pennsylvania wanted change. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=23.92s)]
*  They wanted something different, and I think they concluded that Bob Casey was just a kind [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=26.9s)]
*  of quiet status quo and that he shifted too far to the left with the whole rest of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=30.54s)]
*  Democratic Party and he fell out with what Pennsylvanians believe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Dave McCormick, West Point graduate, 82nd Airborne, he kind of was much more in tune [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  with the state, and Donald Trump's victory helped as well, the fact that Trump was able [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=43.94s)]
*  to carry Pennsylvania. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  But people want normal, common sense solutions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=50.54s)]
*  They don't want liberal nonsense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=52.9s)]
*  And that's really where Pennsylvania is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=54.66s)]
*  Yeah, it really well said. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=56.58s)]
*  You know, Reince, I'm not going to lie, full disclosure as long as Ari's doing it, I guess [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  it's confession time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=64.82s)]
*  I checked in with you a lot all throughout the days leading up to the election and on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=66.74s)]
*  election day, and the day before the election, you said mathematically there's no way based [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=71.94s)]
*  on early voting numbers that Democrats would be able to make up the vote on election day [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=77.66s)]
*  to come back and it was your strong belief. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  And you said this the day before election day, Donald Trump will win Wisconsin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=85.88s)]
*  How did you know? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, I knew because there are two buckets of votes that if you're into this game and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  the mechanics, there's an early vote and there's the election day vote. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  And the Democrats had way too big of a hill to climb to make up the vote on election day. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  I also thought that Donald Trump would win all three of the Midwest states because the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=107.72s)]
*  only people left, the three and a half percent undecided. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=113.2s)]
*  That three and a half percent is the same person in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=116.44s)]
*  I mean, look, the Democrats entire campaign right now was all about Donald Trump, how [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=121.44s)]
*  unacceptable Donald Trump was. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=127.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Democrat Party. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=129.56s)]
*  And hats off to Susie and Chris and Michael Wotley and Laura. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=134.04s)]
*  They did a great job. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=138.16s)]
*  But here's the reality. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=139.16s)]
*  The reality is Donald Trump won in places in New Jersey, in New York, in Minnesota, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  where there was no ground game. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  There was no party. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=150.0s)]
*  There were no ads or messages. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=151.24s)]
*  Donald Trump won across the board, popular vote. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  He won in Puerto Rican communities in Florida. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  By the way, the new governor in Puerto Rico is not just a Republican representative of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=158.88s)]
*  Puerto Rico. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=164.68s)]
*  She was the former chairwoman of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=165.72s)]
*  Their Senate president's a Republican. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=171.12s)]
*  Their Senate speaker is a Republican. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=173.04s)]
*  So this idea that Puerto Rico's just a bunch of Democrats is totally false. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=175.4s)]
*  And Donald Trump won that in the Puerto Rican community. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean, it's an unbelievable mandate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=184.48s)]
*  It is a complete and total annihilation of the progressive movement in the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=186.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller, let's get your overall view. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=192.64s)]
*  And you know, a lot of people are—on the left are trying to continue the fear-mongering, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  the demagoguing, the hyperbole that Donald Trump is going to be a dictator from day one. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  That comment was made to me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  I said, people claim you're going to do this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  He said, just for one day, because they're going to make us on day one energy dominant [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  and I'm going to fix the border. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=217.28s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=218.84s)]
*  They cut off the sentence right there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=220.16s)]
*  They did it on purpose. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=221.64s)]
*  They lied, manipulated, all of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=222.64s)]
*  But to me, where his passion is—and he expressed this on election night when he spoke—is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=226.0s)]
*  that he wants to bring America back, fix the borders, fix the economy, bring back law and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=231.72s)]
*  order, energy dominance. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=237.72s)]
*  He brought us to energy independence for the first time in 75 years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=239.78s)]
*  And frankly, to make the world a safer place, I don't think he's going to have much [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  time to care about liberal commentators on TV. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=249.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=253.4s)]
*  Well, what you see on TV, some of these tears from the radical Marxists and progressives, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=254.4s)]
*  just underscores, again, why Donald Trump won such a massive historic landslide, a victory [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=262.8s)]
*  when you take into account what he was up against that is unparalleled in not just the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=269.8s)]
*  history of our country, but modern history in any country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=274.88s)]
*  Because he spoke to the hopes and dreams of Americans, Sean. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  He talked about having a sovereign, secure border, about, as you said, not just energy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=283.08s)]
*  independence, but energy dominance, being the energy market for planet Earth, about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  ending wars and restoring peace and stability all over the planet. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=293.52s)]
*  He talked about revolutionizing science and technology, sending an American astronaut [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=298.64s)]
*  to Mars, working with Elon Musk to lead the way into space, radical reductions in wasteful [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=303.82s)]
*  government regulation to create an economic boom, reshoring our jobs from overseas to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=311.02s)]
*  be manufacturing independence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=316.14s)]
*  Sean, this was truly, as he said, a golden age of America plan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  This is the reason why he won that massive landslide. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=323.3s)]
*  It was not just the most brilliant campaign in history, but it was also the most brilliant [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=325.62s)]
*  policy strategy in history, and that is how he's going to unite America behind that plan [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=330.62s)]
*  for total national success. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=336.09999999999997s)]
*  I think, Ari, if the president focuses in on the agenda, that will be his legacy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=339.7s)]
*  That will be where his greatest success will be. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=347.58s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=350.06s)]
*  Sean, I think something else is going to be different in his second term. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=351.06s)]
*  The mainstream media is much less significant than they were in 2017 when they went nuts [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  with collusion and the Steele dossier. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=359.1s)]
*  He's not going to be under the withering attack that he was before. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=361.66s)]
*  He's going to be able to rise above it and not have to deal with these distractions from [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=365.54s)]
*  the side. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  Their playbook was tried against him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  It failed, and now he can concentrate on his job. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  He can concentrate on governing and leading this country to that boom that he talks about. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=375.5s)]
*  I think that's going to be a big difference. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats are marginalized. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  The press is marginalized, and Trump can do his job and not have to worry about protecting [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=383.22s)]
*  his flank from these nonsense charges. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=387.66s)]
*  That's going to be a difference in his second term. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=391.06s)]
*  Yeah, I agree completely. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate you all. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=396.14s)]
*  Congratulations to all three of you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOmEEZz_MwE&t=397.14s)]
