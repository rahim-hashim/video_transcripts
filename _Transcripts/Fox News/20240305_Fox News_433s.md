# Legal experts break down Trump’s presidential immunity claims
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w)
*  Now, the Colorado ballot dispute is not the only case that President Trump has now before [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=0.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=4.68s)]
*  They also agreed last week to hear arguments on the issue of presidential immunity in his [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=5.98s)]
*  D.C. case. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=11.64s)]
*  Here now with more, executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice Jordan [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=12.88s)]
*  Sekulow is with us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=16.96s)]
*  They represented, by the way, the Republican Party of Colorado in the ballot case. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is with us, and Fox News legal analyst Greg [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=22.64s)]
*  Jarrett. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Jordan, let me start with you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  First, you were involved, the ACLJ was involved, in this issue representing the Republican [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Party of Colorado. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  I did sense that a lot of the arguments you put forward were actually considered by justices. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=36.68s)]
*  That was my take. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=42.16s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=43.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=44.16s)]
*  Yeah, we actually have a side-by-side that we put up today on our broadcast, where you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=45.16s)]
*  can see our brief and then see the majority opinion today and see kind of the language [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=49.16s)]
*  used. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=54.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying the justices took it verbatim, but I would be pretty excited about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=55.32s)]
*  what our ACLJ team, our legal team, put together on this case. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=59.36s)]
*  And I think with Justice Barrett summed it up right, all that Americans need to take [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=63.28s)]
*  away, as you said, Sean, is that all nine justices agree that this is the wrong process [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=66.84s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=71.48s)]
*  On this matter, that states, secretaries of states and random officials at the state level [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=72.48s)]
*  should have no role in deciding what presidential candidate is on the ballot. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=77.92s)]
*  And let's not forget, it was not just Democrats, but plenty of Rhino Republicans who took the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=81.68s)]
*  same position as those Democrats who wanted to remove President Trump from the ballot [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=87.12s)]
*  this way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  And the Supreme Court told them, even three liberal members of the Supreme Court, no, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  you can't do this, nine to zero. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, on to immunity. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=99.0s)]
*  We've done in those cases, we did those cases when the president was in office. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=100.92s)]
*  And you remember Adam Schiff was obsessed with getting his tax returns. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=104.92s)]
*  It's all going to come down to that question presented. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=108.84s)]
*  And I said, you know, Jack Smith, that may have been his biggest problem with this whole [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  issue is the question presented that was written by the court, Sean, which says, let's look [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=115.84s)]
*  at actual official acts of the president and whether or not official acts of the president [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=120.76s)]
*  are those acts then immune from prosecution. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=126.28s)]
*  And I could see how this case gets a decision at the Supreme Court, Sean, and then has to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=130.06s)]
*  be sit down all the way back to a district court to decide official versus unofficial [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=135.28s)]
*  acts and, again, this not affecting President Trump in his reelection efforts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, on the issue of immunity, all of us agreed that the court had an obligation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=145.12s)]
*  to take that case up, but I know Greg, yourself, I felt the same way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=150.56s)]
*  I wasn't sure that they would. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=154.8s)]
*  Rightly, they did take that issue up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=156.6s)]
*  How do you see the arguments falling in that case? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=159.24s)]
*  Well, as you know, I predicted the outcome of this case exactly, how the court would [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=162.16s)]
*  decide nine to nothing using the fifth section of the 14th Amendment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=167.6s)]
*  On the issue of immunity, I'm going to make a prediction here, too. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=173.36s)]
*  I think both sides argue too broadly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=176.84s)]
*  I think Trump was wrong to have his lawyers say that if a president orders the Seals to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  kill his opponent, he can be immunized unless he gets impeached first. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  That went too far. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=190.68s)]
*  The answer should have been, of course not, now let me explain. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=191.68s)]
*  But I also think the lower court went way too far by having no immunity whatsoever and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=194.56s)]
*  saying that whatever a president may have had immunity while in office, he loses that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=199.32s)]
*  once he leaves office. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=204.32s)]
*  I hope and I suspect that the court granted cert in this case in order to come out with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=206.0s)]
*  a nuanced decision that focuses on precisely what are presidential acts, and if they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=211.16s)]
*  within the scope of presidential acts, then they have to go beyond the presidency itself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=218.72s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=224.44s)]
*  President Eisenhower in 1954 sends troops down to implement the Brown vs. Board of Education. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=225.96s)]
*  One of the children or one of the police officers is killed, and the new president coming in, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=232.16s)]
*  a democrat, years later, wants to indict Eisenhower for having done that, even though it was in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  his presidential authority. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=243.72s)]
*  I think we would all agree that there has to be some immunity, and we would all agree [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=245.12s)]
*  that he can't have total immunity for everything he did as a politician or as an individual. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=250.68s)]
*  So I think the Supreme Court, hopefully, will come out with a nuanced decision that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=255.88s)]
*  will give guidance to the lower courts as to when immunity is applicable, when it's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=261.0s)]
*  not applicable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=266.08s)]
*  We can bring the country together on this issue as well, instead of simply having extreme [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=267.12s)]
*  views on both sides. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=272.6s)]
*  You know, I actually concur with what you just said, and I think, Greg, what Professor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=274.08s)]
*  Dershowitz is saying is that the argument of absolute immunity probably is too broad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=279.56s)]
*  And a more nuanced judgment of the court, I think, would probably be more appropriate [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  in this case, and maybe even the better argument for the court. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  Your take. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=295.0s)]
*  Well, I think the Supreme Court looked at the Circuit Court decision and said, hey, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=296.0s)]
*  you went way too far. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=302.02s)]
*  You're dismissing any notion of immunity, even if a president acts consistent with his [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  duties. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=309.76s)]
*  That is absurd, logically. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=310.84s)]
*  And it's inconsistent, by the way, and this is the important part, with the Supreme Court [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=312.84s)]
*  precedent four decades ago, that a president does have absolute immunity from civil lawsuits [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=317.28s)]
*  as long as his actions fall within the outer perimeter of his official legs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=324.52s)]
*  Well, you know, Sean, the exact same reasoning applies to criminal prosecutions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=329.88s)]
*  If it's otherwise, my goodness, the chilling effect on presidential decision-making would [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=335.55999999999995s)]
*  trigger paralysis. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=341.16s)]
*  Instead of a chief executive, America would be ruled by a committee of lawyers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=343.28s)]
*  They'd be afraid to do anything out of fear of future prosecution. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=348.72s)]
*  Greg, let me ask you this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=353.2s)]
*  Would a more nuanced version versus the argument of absolute immunity maybe be, of course, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=354.92s)]
*  you have freedom of speech, but you can't yell fire in a crowded building? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=360.08s)]
*  Would that be—would there be an analogy there? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=364.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=367.6s)]
*  And I agree with the professor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  And you would expect the court to do that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  And Jordan said this as well. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  I suspect the current justices will extend the existing immunity standard in civil actions [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  to criminal cases and then remand the Trump case back to the trial court to decide whether [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=380.94s)]
*  Trump's acts are covered as official acts. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think he has very good argument that they are. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=390.24s)]
*  If he believed there was election fraud, even a mistaken belief, he has a sworn duty [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=392.92s)]
*  to enforce all laws and receive protection. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Professor, real quick, you wanted to— [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=402.68s)]
*  But it won't be unanimous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=403.68s)]
*  It won't be unanimous this time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  It won't be. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  This will be a divided opinion. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  And I suspect it will be 6-3. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  I suspect you're probably right too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=412.8s)]
*  You're so far 1-0. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofz5SJid8w&t=414.68s)]
