# Sean Hannity: This will happen if Kamala gets her way
**Fox News:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight fireworks on Capitol Hill more than a week after Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump was nearly assassinated. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=6.96s)]
*  Secret Service Director Kim Cheadle is refusing to step down or even provide simple, basic, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=9.28s)]
*  fundamental answers what, nine days after the shooting, a complete dereliction of duty. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=15.44s)]
*  She should be fired. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=20.98s)]
*  She should have been fired. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=22.38s)]
*  Her lack of answers, it is repulsive, it is dangerous to the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=23.52s)]
*  Now we're going to bring you all the highlights and reaction. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=28.32s)]
*  Jim Jordan, James Comer, all coming up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=31.16s)]
*  But tonight we begin at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where once again the lights are on, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  but nobody's home. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=39.64s)]
*  It has been more than 24 hours since Joe Biden announced that he was ending his reelection [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=41.02s)]
*  bid in a short letter. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=45.92s)]
*  Biden is reportedly in Delaware, but we haven't seen him in days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=48.24s)]
*  In fairness, he did had COVID. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=52.46s)]
*  They did call into a campaign event for Kamala Harris and sounded frankly awful. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=54.24s)]
*  And by the way, take a listen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=59.72s)]
*  To be real clear, we're still fighting in this fight together. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=61.84s)]
*  I'm not going anywhere. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=66.48s)]
*  And I want you to know, I've always, you've always had my back and I promise you, I will [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=67.48s)]
*  always have your back and I'm anxious for you all to hear from Kamala. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=71.88s)]
*  Now Biden has been under the weather with COVID for about a week now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=78.4s)]
*  And during that time, the elites in his own party successfully booted him from the ticket. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=82.04s)]
*  You know, Washington elites, Nantucket elites, Hollywood elites. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=86.92s)]
*  They did it with 56 days until early voting begins in Pennsylvania, then rolls out around [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=94.72s)]
*  106 days until the election. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=95.72s)]
*  And yet for some reason, Biden refuses to step down as president, even though he is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=98.4s)]
*  so obviously incapable, unable to perform the basic duties of his job and hasn't even [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=103.48s)]
*  bothered to phone it in this week. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=110.74s)]
*  His schedule is almost completely empty. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=112.82s)]
*  If he's not strong enough to run for president, he's not strong enough to be the president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=115.14s)]
*  For the safety of our country, for the safety of the world, the 25th amendment needs to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  be invoked immediately. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=127.58s)]
*  He must be removed from office. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=129.82s)]
*  Something, frankly, that should have happened a long time ago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=132.1s)]
*  Now even Michael Moore is calling on him to resign from office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=135.78s)]
*  But now, well, the coronation of Kamala Harris is underway. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=140.0s)]
*  Without a single primary vote to her name, the vice president has now been selected by [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=144.18s)]
*  that handful of elite party leaders to run for president. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=150.0s)]
*  The results from this year's Democratic primary have been tossed in the trash. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=154.06s)]
*  Voters be damned and completely disenfranchised. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=158.96s)]
*  And like it or not, Kamala will now almost certainly represent the Democrats in November. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=162.28s)]
*  And she is so, so grateful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=167.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=170.36s)]
*  Our president, Joe Biden, wanted to be here today. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=171.36s)]
*  He is feeling much better and recovering fast. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=173.56s)]
*  And he looks forward to getting back on the road. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=176.56s)]
*  And I wanted to say a few words about our president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=179.16s)]
*  Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=182.28s)]
*  history. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=188.08s)]
*  In one term, he has already—yes, you make laugh. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=189.36s)]
*  All right, buckle up, because Democrats, the state-run media mob, they are now pitching [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=195.44s)]
*  Kamala as the second coming of Jesus, which I can assure you she is not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  The puff pieces, they are already being written. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=207.12s)]
*  The accolades, they are pouring in from every radical Democratic, leftist, socialist, Marxist [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=208.96s)]
*  in the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  The phony polls, I promise you, will follow, showing she is energizing Democrats. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=215.56s)]
*  We might even be beating Donald Trump in a swing state or two, or maybe three. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=220.94s)]
*  Yet, in reality, just last year, Pelosi, other top Democrats, go back one year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=225.78s)]
*  They openly were doubting whether or not Harris should even remain on the ticket with Biden. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=231.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=237.26s)]
*  Does Vice President Kamala Harris, the best running mate for this president? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=238.26s)]
*  He thinks so, and that's what matters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=241.94s)]
*  And by the way— [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=244.4s)]
*  Do you think so? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=245.4s)]
*  She's very politically astute. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=246.4s)]
*  I don't think people give her enough credit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  Do you think she is the best running mate, though? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=250.22s)]
*  She's the vice president of the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=253.3s)]
*  People say to me, why isn't she doing this or that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=255.3s)]
*  I say, because she's the vice president. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=257.9s)]
*  That's the job description. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=259.98s)]
*  You don't do that much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=263.06s)]
*  I actually think it's a pretty simple question. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=264.06s)]
*  Do you think Kamala Harris is the best running mate for President Biden? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=266.22s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=270.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what else I can say other than she would be an excellent running [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=271.02s)]
*  mate and an excellent vice president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=275.58s)]
*  She's running. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=279.54s)]
*  She's absolutely vice president. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=280.54s)]
*  How's that for a vote of confidence? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=281.54s)]
*  Now, despite what you might hear in the coming days and weeks, Vice President Harris was [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=283.54s)]
*  long considered toxic to the Democratic Party. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=288.14s)]
*  And just last week, an insider advantage—that's Matt Towery, his poll, showing Kamala down [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=291.42s)]
*  huge in a hypothetical matchup with Donald Trump in every battleground state. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=297.06s)]
*  She was down by 10 in Georgia, down by 7 in Pennsylvania, down by 10 in Nevada, down by [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=302.34s)]
*  6 in Arizona. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=308.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, a recent Harris-Forbes poll shows Trump beating Kamala Harris by nine points [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=309.18s)]
*  nationwide. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=314.94s)]
*  Those polls will tighten. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=316.22s)]
*  The media will race into a rescue. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=317.56s)]
*  But in terms of her approval rating, no vice president in modern American history, not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=320.04s)]
*  one, has polled worse than Kamala Harris. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=326.62s)]
*  But don't worry, the same lying, corrupt state media mob, the same Democrats that lied [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=331.56s)]
*  about and covered up Joe's cognitive decline, they will be there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  They will rescue her. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  They will bail her out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  They will act like she is, you know, the second coming. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=343.98s)]
*  But what's behind the horrible numbers? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=347.1s)]
*  Well, as Kamala likes to say, well, she didn't just fall out of a coconut tree. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=349.38000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=356.5s)]
*  My mother used to—she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=357.5s)]
*  don't know what's wrong with you young people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=362.5s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=364.92s)]
*  You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=366.92s)]
*  Oh, she loves—that's like her favorite line of all time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=376.92s)]
*  Yes, you're giggling, Vice President. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=381.32s)]
*  You can't say on the view giggling, though, that hard-hitting news show, because they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=383.76s)]
*  think that's sexist. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=387.16s)]
*  Anyway, here's the context. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=388.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris has a horrific track record, even worse public persona, and some have pointed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=390.56s)]
*  out that Kamala Harris almost always sounds like somebody trying to give a book report [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=397.76s)]
*  for a book that they never read. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=402.48s)]
*  Here's Exhibit A. Take a look. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=404.32s)]
*  You know, when we talk about our children, I know for this group, we all believe that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=406.64s)]
*  when we talk about the children of the community, they are a children of the community. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=410.24s)]
*  And in that way, we should all feel a direct sense of responsibility for their well-being. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=416.16s)]
*  When you talk about serving the community, you're talking about serving the community. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=423.36s)]
*  So that was Kamala on children of the community. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=429.48s)]
*  Now here's Kamala on transportation, so you can get to go where you need to go. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=433.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=439.8s)]
*  Together, we are expanding access to transportation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=440.8s)]
*  Things like maybe it's a small issue, it's a big issue. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=445.52s)]
*  You need to get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go to do the work [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=448.24s)]
*  and get home. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=452.56s)]
*  So we have expanded access to transportation, including what we need to do to invest in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=454.4s)]
*  public transit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  You need to get to go where you need to get to go, because that's what transportation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=462.02s)]
*  is. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=467.32s)]
*  According to one Axios report, it appears that Kamala Harris has trouble in public because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=468.32s)]
*  of her, well, general incompetence. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=473.48s)]
*  At one point, she was so worried about an upcoming dinner at a D.C. News mogul's home [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=475.56s)]
*  that she had her staff, quote, they held a mock dinner beforehand with staffers playing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=480.96s)]
*  participants. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=486.56s)]
*  The report continues, Harris age even considered including wine in the mock prep so Harris [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=487.56s)]
*  would practice with a glass or two. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=493.92s)]
*  You know, proper sipping technique is very important. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=495.8s)]
*  Unfortunately for her staff, this was probably not an enjoyable rehearsal. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=498.84s)]
*  Quote, former Harris age told Axios that the high turnover is partly because of how the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=502.96s)]
*  vice president treats her staff. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  But despite everything we just showed you, Kamala's worst quality by far is a radical [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=512.04s)]
*  set of beliefs. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  And without a doubt, the Democrats have never nominated somebody this far radical socialist [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=518.48s)]
*  Marxist left. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=524.8s)]
*  Don't take it from, you know, let's take it from our own words. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=526.6s)]
*  Let's do it that way. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's Kamala. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  So again, back to the United States Congress. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=535.12s)]
*  If they fail to act as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  to pass a Green New Deal. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=543.64s)]
*  We have to have a secure border. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=545.24s)]
*  But I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=547.28s)]
*  across the border as criminals. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=551.32s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=552.6s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=553.6s)]
*  Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=554.6s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=559.64s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  But would you support changing the dietary guidelines? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=566.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the food pyramid. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  To reduce red meat specifically. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  Yes, I would. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  Plastic straws are a big thing right now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=575.88s)]
*  Do you ban plastic straws? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=576.88s)]
*  I think we should. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=577.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=579.88s)]
*  Now, if Kamala gets away, you will no longer get to enjoy private health insurance or gas-powered [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=581.84s)]
*  vehicles or plastic straws. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=587.04s)]
*  I don't know about you. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=589.24s)]
*  I hate the paper straws. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=590.64s)]
*  It'll ruin any drink. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  And if you think energy costs are bad now, just wait. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=594.08s)]
*  If you think taxes are bad now, just wait. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=597.3s)]
*  They're going to get much worse under Kamala Harris if she's ever elected. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=600.32s)]
*  She literally supports the Green New Deal. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=603.88s)]
*  She signed on as a sponsor of that very bill in the U.S. Senate. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=606.08s)]
*  She also supports zero bail laws, even supported that bail fund four days after the burning [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=611.2s)]
*  down of that police precinct in Minneapolis. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=616.88s)]
*  That was during the peaceful protest this summer. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  Right, it's the 574 of them in 2020. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=623.48s)]
*  You know, individuals, because of her bail fund, they went from a quarter of a million [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  dollars to nearly $45 million. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=631.5200000000001s)]
*  So many were bailed out with the help of Kamala Harris, and those people went on to commit [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=634.66s)]
*  unspeakable crimes, including murder and even, you know, rapes, etc. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=639.62s)]
*  If you really want to know how Kamala will govern, look at the border. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=645.3s)]
*  She was tasked with the border. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=649.76s)]
*  She was tasked with fixing illegal immigration, the crisis in this country. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=651.86s)]
*  But she kept telling us for three years she lied and said the border was secure and the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=656.54s)]
*  border was closed. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=660.22s)]
*  She only made it worse. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=662.1400000000001s)]
*  More than nearly 11 million unvetted Biden-Harris illegal immigrants pouring into this country [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=663.7800000000001s)]
*  from nearly 180 countries, including terrorists, rapists, murderers, drug dealers, cartel members, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=669.0200000000001s)]
*  other violent criminals. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=675.74s)]
*  Kamala has blood on her hands, just like Joe Biden has blood on his hands. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=677.74s)]
*  And still she has yet to provide a single solution, not one. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  And now she wants to be promoted to president. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=687.46s)]
*  She made one trip to the border, but not any point that mattered. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  And make no mistake, she owns every single one of Joe Biden's horrendous policy failures, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=693.62s)]
*  from the border to the economy to inflation to high energy prices to the disaster of a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=700.42s)]
*  withdrawal out of Afghanistan, all the lawlessness in every small town and every big city in [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=706.74s)]
*  our country. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=712.22s)]
*  And that brings us to another looming problem surrounding Kamala's candidacy. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=713.42s)]
*  We now have complete and total confirmation. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=717.78s)]
*  She spent the last four years lying to all of you about Joe Biden and his cognitive state. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=720.6999999999999s)]
*  She lied. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=728.9s)]
*  She covered up. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=729.98s)]
*  She was the liar in chief. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=731.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=733.18s)]
*  We have a very bold and vibrant president in Joe Biden. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=734.18s)]
*  The way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=740.3399999999999s)]
*  wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=747.7s)]
*  Gratuitous. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=754.1s)]
*  He is an extraordinary leader, and I wish that people could see what I see, because [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=755.1s)]
*  Joe Biden is very much alive and running for reelection. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=760.9000000000001s)]
*  If there was a problem— [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=764.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm not lying. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  If there was a— [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=766.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you a fact. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=767.5400000000001s)]
*  But if there ever is a problem— [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=770.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you think that you could go tell the American public? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=773.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you think in your role that you're in a position to do that? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=776.66s)]
*  Of course, if necessary, but there's no need for that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=782.1s)]
*  She had lunch with Joe Biden, we were told, every single week. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  They saw each other often. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=790.8s)]
*  They appeared together at events frequently. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=792.42s)]
*  Vice President Harris knew better, but she made the conscious decision to lie to you, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=794.98s)]
*  to cover it up, to cover it up again and again and again. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=800.9s)]
*  And of course, everyone in the Democratic Party, everyone in the state-run media mob, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=804.94s)]
*  lied to your face for years. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  They are all corrupt to the core. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  They are completely dishonest. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  The only thing they know is they hate Donald Trump. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=816.22s)]
*  They only started to tell the truth when it became obvious that Joe Biden was not going [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=818.64s)]
*  to win. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=823.94s)]
*  Everyone has known about Joe's cognitive state for years. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=825.5600000000001s)]
*  It's only an issue when they risk losing power, all because of it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=828.7s)]
*  Party elites, they didn't care the president was barely functioning. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=835.4200000000001s)]
*  They just want a frontman to say the right words, sign the right bills, while they work [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=839.08s)]
*  behind the scenes and implement their radical, far-left, socialist, Marxist agenda. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=844.9200000000001s)]
*  That's why Harris has now tapped Obama loyalists, people like Eric Holder and David Ploof, to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=850.7s)]
*  lead her campaign. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=857.42s)]
*  While Kamala Harris might soon be her party's nominee, it will be Democratic elites. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=859.0s)]
*  It'll be the likes of Obama and Pelosi and Schumer and the Squad and the Congressional [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=863.74s)]
*  Black Caucus that supported her that will control the agenda. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=869.78s)]
*  Kamala will just be another front person. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=874.02s)]
*  Clearly, in the Democratic Party, democracy, the people mean nothing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zql5e29DSBM&t=876.66s)]
