# Sean Hannity: Democrats are flat-out lying
**Fox News:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we begin with an important and virtuous message from the Democratic Party. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=2.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=7.04s)]
*  This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=9.32s)]
*  Each, each of us is equal before the law. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=13.64s)]
*  No one, no one is above the law. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=17.68s)]
*  The fact is no one is above the law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=20.8s)]
*  In this country, no one is above the law. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=23.36s)]
*  The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=26.84s)]
*  Make no mistake, no one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=32.16s)]
*  In my administration, no one, in my administration, no one is above the law. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=38.6s)]
*  Ah, never mind. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=42.64s)]
*  Kidding as usual. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=44.68s)]
*  Now, the Democrats you saw there, they're just flat out lying. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=45.68s)]
*  In fact, there are people who are very clearly above the law, the ones that are lecturing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=49.28s)]
*  all of you about the rule of law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  You know, and by the way, they are called the Biden family, or as we affectionately [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=57.08s)]
*  refer to them on this program, as simply the syndicate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=60.8s)]
*  Early today, in a move that surprised no one who watches this channel, President Biden [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=64.44s)]
*  did issue a full, unconditional pardon to his beloved son, Hunter, only months after [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=69.0s)]
*  vowing over and over again that he would never pardon Hunter because of his deep, unwavering [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=74.36s)]
*  commitment to justice and the rule of law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=80.24s)]
*  You might recall. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=82.96s)]
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=89.32s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=90.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=92.6s)]
*  You have. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=93.6s)]
*  Does the President have any intention of pardoning him? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=94.6s)]
*  We've been asked that question multiple times. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=98.28s)]
*  Our answer stands, which is no. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=100.08s)]
*  Is there any possibility that the President would end up pardoning his son? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=102.16s)]
*  No. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, is there a possibility? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  I just said no. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  And I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=109.2s)]
*  I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that, and I will not pardon him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=113.92s)]
*  I could speak for the President, and he said he would not pardon his son, and I'm just [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=118.72s)]
*  going to leave it there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=124.28s)]
*  You didn't take that seriously, did you? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=126.56s)]
*  That was before the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=128.16s)]
*  And like always, Biden, the entire White House, they were lying to the American people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=130.2s)]
*  According to NBC News, they knew that Biden was planning a possible pardon, but decided [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=135.24s)]
*  to tell the American people the exact opposite of what he was thinking. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=139.88s)]
*  In a nutshell is the Biden doctrine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=143.94s)]
*  They just plain out blatantly lie about everything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=146.4s)]
*  Remember, the border is closed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=148.96s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  Biden is running, he's running circles around his staff. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=152.3s)]
*  He's got so much energy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=155.28s)]
*  He's cognitively as sharp as ever, as he's ever been. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=157.0s)]
*  Inflation is transitory. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump, a threat to democracy, and that he sponsored Project 2025 and wanted to ban [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=163.68s)]
*  abortion nationwide and would sign that as president and limit access to contraception [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=168.48s)]
*  and stop IVF treatments for women. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=174.24s)]
*  They said crime was down, lie. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=176.8s)]
*  Inflation was down, lie. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=178.78s)]
*  The withdrawal from Afghanistan went really, really well, if you believe them, never mind [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=180.02s)]
*  what lies Kamala told. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=184.56s)]
*  Whoa, you know, would she have ever really closed the border? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=186.2s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=189.36s)]
*  Would she give taxpayer-funded sex change operations to illegals as she once said she [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=190.44000000000003s)]
*  would? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=195.24s)]
*  Probably. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=196.24s)]
*  Gender-affirming care without parental consent? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=197.24s)]
*  Likely. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=199.36s)]
*  Ban fracking and drilling, which she said often? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=200.36s)]
*  I bet yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=202.56s)]
*  Pack the U.S. Supreme Court, eliminate the filibuster as she had promised, make D.C., [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=203.84s)]
*  Puerto Rico a state, continue the weaponization of justice? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=208.56s)]
*  Well, we've all been subjected to one insane lie after another, that only a handful of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=212.4s)]
*  remaining MS, DNC, fake news, CNN viewers could or would believe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=218.56s)]
*  So it is not a shocker that Joe Biden lied about a pardon for Hunter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=224.12s)]
*  And keep in mind, this wasn't just a pardon for the felonies that Hunter was already convicted [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=228.28s)]
*  of. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=233.52s)]
*  No, this was a sweeping pardon that covers any and all federal crimes Hunter committed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=234.52s)]
*  or may have committed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  The dates are important, January 1st, 2014, and yesterday, December 1st, 2024. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=243.12s)]
*  In other words, Biden, Hunter Biden, will face no consequences for any actions over [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  the past 11 years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  Now, that oddly specific timeline, how conveniently happens to coincide with the very same year [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=256.44s)]
*  that Hunter started raking in millions of dollars from Ukraine? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=265.06s)]
*  Remember, he was on the border with Burisma, no experience in energy, oil, gas, Ukraine, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  was getting paid millions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=274.44s)]
*  But according to Joe, he never, I never once spoke to my son, my brother, or anybody for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  that matter, about their foreign business deals, in spite of what looks like evidence [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=282.06s)]
*  to the contrary, you know, pictures. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=286.64s)]
*  I guess he just, you know, pulled out, pulled 2014 out of a hat. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  That was, that was a random year, just like he randomly pressured Ukraine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=292.48s)]
*  Remember, he bragged about it, about withholding billions in aid until they agreed to fire [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  the prosecutor, investigating his zero experience son being paid millions and Burisma? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=301.64s)]
*  Or the more likely scenario, that was the real quid pro quo with Ukraine, Joe Biden [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=308.52s)]
*  was just lying through his teeth as always. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=312.84s)]
*  Think about this, 2014, that start date also happens to cover Hunter's sweetheart deal [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=315.32s)]
*  with, oh, the Bank of China. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=322.08s)]
*  Remember, deal with a state-run Chinese energy company, CEFC. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Remember the WhatsApp message? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=328.52s)]
*  I'm sitting here next to my dad, remember that part? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  And more sketchy deals, you know, with oligarchs from Kazakhstan, a generous $3.5 million wire [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=332.78s)]
*  transfer from the former first lady of Moscow, Elena Baterina. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=339.2s)]
*  Remember her? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  As documented by the joint report from the Senate Finance and Homeland Security Committees, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Department also covering allegations of tax evasion, money laundering, fara violations [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=350.82s)]
*  and even federal bribery, corruption charges. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=355.9s)]
*  That's around, you know, what, 10% for the big guy or half my money goes to Pops? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=359.26s)]
*  But can the big guy sleep easy tonight? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=365.38s)]
*  That's a legal question. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=368.1s)]
*  Is the Biden family syndicate officially in the clear? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=369.53999999999996s)]
*  What about all the money Hunter says he gave to Pops? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=373.38s)]
*  Half my income goes to Pops, it was on the laptop from hell. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  Did other monies that he took in go to his brother? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=379.7s)]
*  Maybe wives involved, maybe ex-wives involved. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=384.7s)]
*  What about the children? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=387.24s)]
*  Did any money go to them? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=388.24s)]
*  If so, will Joe pardon all of them? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  Will Joe Biden in the end pardon himself? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=393.08s)]
*  As Politico put it, this 11-year pardon is quite possibly the most generous, extensive [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=395.86s)]
*  pardon in decades. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=401.56s)]
*  Now some Democratic voters appear shocked and angry that Biden is, in fact, not a man [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=403.26s)]
*  of his word. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=407.85999999999996s)]
*  On X, Nate Silver called Biden a, quote, selfish and senile old man who destroyed the Democratic [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  Party. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=415.02s)]
*  Nate, why didn't you say all that ahead of time, before the election? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=416.02s)]
*  While that may be true, well, here is another hard truth for my friends on the left. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  The legacy media, so-called journalists that they respect and adore are brainless, spineless [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=424.94s)]
*  and nothing but shills for the Democratic Party. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  The polling, by the way, that people like Nate Silver use from them, kind of sucked [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=436.3s)]
*  also. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=440.38s)]
*  They don't investigate big stories. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=441.38s)]
*  They don't look for the truth. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=442.70000000000005s)]
*  Instead, just look at the latest Democratic talking point, repeat that, regurgitate that, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=444.18s)]
*  wash your hands, repeat. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=449.18s)]
*  That's their formula. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=450.18s)]
*  And that's why Americans rejected them as well in November. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=451.5s)]
*  Now here, for example, is a sample of how they covered Biden's promise that he would [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=454.82000000000005s)]
*  never ever pardon Hunter. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=459.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  ... a major commitment from the president, accepting the outcome of the trial and also [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=462.86s)]
*  pledging not to pardon his son. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=467.58s)]
*  Just to be clear, the president has ruled out pardoning his son for those... [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=470.14s)]
*  I'll bet you a dollar. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=474.78s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=475.78s)]
*  This week, of course, Hunter Biden was found guilty and Joe Biden has very clearly said [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=476.78s)]
*  he would not pardon his son, he would not commute his sentence. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=482.3s)]
*  Current president of the United States has so much respect for the law that he has said [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=485.46s)]
*  he would not pardon his son. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=491.1s)]
*  He is not pardoning his son, which he could do. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=493.14000000000004s)]
*  These are federal charges. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=497.38s)]
*  He is not doing that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=498.94s)]
*  That is a power. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=499.94s)]
*  He is a power for both of those. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=500.94s)]
*  He is not doing it because he is living what it means to have a rule of law in this country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  You think you'll ever trust the legacy media again, these channels? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=509.5s)]
*  But just, you know, they just took Biden out of his word and regurgitated it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=515.14s)]
*  Why would anyone in their right mind take Biden out of his word? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=519.4599999999999s)]
*  We on this channel, on this show, we tell you the truth. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  We've been right about Richard Jewell going back to the beginning. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=525.74s)]
*  We were right about UVA. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=528.62s)]
*  We were right about Duke Lacrosse. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=530.2199999999999s)]
*  We were right about Freddie Gray in Baltimore. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=531.66s)]
*  We were right about Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=533.74s)]
*  We were right about Obama's radicalism. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=536.54s)]
*  We were right about vetting Kamala Harris, which they wouldn't do. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  We were right about Russia collusion. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=542.3399999999999s)]
*  We were right also about FISA abuse. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=544.02s)]
*  And I can keep going on. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=546.06s)]
*  And they're always wrong. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=547.62s)]
*  They peddle lies and conspiracy theories for a living. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=548.8s)]
*  Joe, a habitual liar, serial plagiarizer since the 1970s. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=551.8s)]
*  And for the legacy media, it was all a means to the end. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=558.04s)]
*  Support the Democratic Party, do it at all costs. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=561.56s)]
*  Thankfully, they no longer have influence over free-thinking Americans that have—in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=564.12s)]
*  the beginning, they sought out talk radio. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=568.92s)]
*  They sought out Fox News. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=571.04s)]
*  Now, they still trust talk radio, Fox News, and they have social media. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  As Elon Musk said, we're all now in the media business. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=578.16s)]
*  And you can post things on your own and pass on information to your friends, the Kamala [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=581.52s)]
*  files that I tried to deputize people with. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=585.36s)]
*  The Democratic Party will soon lose control of the Senate, the House, the White House. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4wFhuSRIA&t=588.48s)]
