# Newt Gingrich: Biden's ‘weakness’ has been dangerous for the world
**Fox News:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM)
*  Here to react to all of this week's breaking news, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm going to get a call from you, maybe in about a month or so, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=4.32s)]
*  saying that I'm pushing the envelope too hard, I'm vetting Kamala too hard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=7.92s)]
*  Clearly, they are testing Kamala Harris. I, there's no way you will ever convince me [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=12.96s)]
*  that President Xi, Vladimir Putin, the mullahs in Iran, Kim Jong-un are ever going to have any [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=21.28s)]
*  respect for her. I don't believe that's true. Well, let me just point out the news break you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=29.52s)]
*  just had should be sobering for every American. If you now have Chinese and Russian military [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=37.6s)]
*  aircraft collaborating off the Alaskan coast, testing our capabilities, so it's a joint [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=45.68s)]
*  Chinese-Russian development, that's a very serious shift in the balance of military power. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=52.72s)]
*  And I think that we ought to be aware of the fact that weakness by the Biden administration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=59.68s)]
*  has encouraged the dictators to believe they can get away with virtually anything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Of course, the Chinese spy balloon that was the size of a school bus going all the way across the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=69.44s)]
*  country without us doing anything was a good example of why they're getting bolder and bolder. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=74.72s)]
*  But I found the story today that you had both Russian bombers and Chinese military aircraft [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=80.64s)]
*  as a group approaching our border. I think that's a very serious signal of how much trouble [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=86.24s)]
*  the Biden administration has created, basically through a policy of weakness and appeasement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think it is, it's dangerous for America and it's dangerous for the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=97.76s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask you. So tonight I decided, part one, by the way, I have a lot more ammunition [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=102.72s)]
*  in my arsenal of truth telling and vetting. You did warn me that I might be going a little [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=111.28s)]
*  hard about Barack Obama, but compared to Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=117.52s)]
*  Barack's a moderate. I mean, you heard her in her own words. What is your reaction to what you heard [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=122.0s)]
*  tonight? And what is every 18 to 24 year old thing being called stupid by Kamala Harris? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=128.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, I hope every 18 to 24 year old her hears that because then they'll all vote [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=136.96s)]
*  for Trump. I think that would be helpful. But look, I don't think you can go too far [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=142.72s)]
*  with Kamala Harris. She is a San Francisco radical. She is to the left of Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=149.44s)]
*  Her views are so far away from the average American that I'm very confident that as the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  American people discover the real Kamala, not the Washington news media comment, not the Hollywood [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=163.6s)]
*  movie made up comment, they find the real Kamala, how she's voted, what bill she introduced, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=172.32s)]
*  what she has said. I think she will melt like George McGovern and Mike Dukakis [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=179.44s)]
*  because I think the average American will not want to have a radical San Francisco candidate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=184.8s)]
*  who personifies everything, first of all, which has destroyed San Francisco. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=191.68s)]
*  I mean, people go there now and look at the human feces in the street, look at the drug [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  syringes in the street, look at how much the population of homeless has exploded. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  That's the city that she was the district attorney in. She represents its values. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=207.28s)]
*  And, by the way, she only got to be the presidential candidate because the super boss of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=212.08s)]
*  San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, and powered Joe Biden into — just brutalized him into having to resign, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  and then pivoted within an hour and began pushing Kamala. And so this is one of the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  least American behaviors. This was a total coup against a sitting president of the United States [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  by his own friends to drive him out of office, even when he'd gotten 14.5 million votes, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=238.64s)]
*  and to replace him with their puppet who got zero votes. She got no votes when she ran on her own [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  in 2000, and she's never been on the ballot by herself. And yet now we're told by people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  who like Biden's speech tonight on the importance of democracy. Well, if democracy matters — [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=257.44s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=262.64s)]
*  How can the Democrats nominate her? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=263.52s)]
*  Let me ask you this. Among some Republicans and conservatives I know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=266.08s)]
*  there seems to be a little bit of fear. Oh, no, they thought it was going to be Joe. Oh, no, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=274.56s)]
*  they fear the change. Most people don't know about Kamala Harris yet. They will know by the time early [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=278.32s)]
*  voting starts in 54 days, and we're a little over 100 days away from Election Day. And, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=285.12s)]
*  what I'm realizing is they don't know that this is a honeymoon period. They don't seem to understand [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=292.96s)]
*  that Democrats, the state-run media mob, are on a sugar high. When does that go away? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=298.4s)]
*  Look, I was with the Bush campaign in 1988 when, in the spring, we were 19 points behind Mike [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=305.44s)]
*  Dukakis. And all summer, we just told the truth. We talked about his record. We talked about what [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=314.64s)]
*  he had done. We didn't attack him as a person. We just said — and I wouldn't attack her much [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=320.72s)]
*  as a person. I would just say, look, if you want a San Francisco radical who believes we ought to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=324.8s)]
*  have millions of immigrants come in illegally, vote illegally, so they can give themselves [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=329.68s)]
*  welfare with your tax dollars, she's perfectly fine. If you want somebody who's anti-police, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=334.88000000000005s)]
*  pro-criminal, she's perfectly fine. If you want somebody the teachers' union is going to own, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  who's going to wipe out school choice and block parents from being involved in their children's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  classroom, she's terrific. If you want somebody who's going to destroy the energy industry, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=349.12s)]
*  say so publicly. She's going to destroy the energy. Her message when she was campaigning last time [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  to Pennsylvanians was, well, we'll help you get transition jobs. Those transition jobs are never [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=358.56s)]
*  going to compare to the energy jobs they have in Western Pennsylvania. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=365.44s)]
*  Where else? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BPMKbRx5nM&t=379.12s)]
