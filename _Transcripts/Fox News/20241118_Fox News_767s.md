# Now MSNBC hosts want to have breakfast at Trump’s house?: Hannity
**Fox News:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk)
*  Well, most anti-Trump hosts, and that is the co-hosts of Liberal Joe, Joe Scarborough, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mika Brzezinski, announcing that the pair attended breakfast—I can't say it with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=7.48s)]
*  a straight face—at Mar-a-Lago, at their request with Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=12.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=17.14s)]
*  Joe and I went to Mar-a-Lago to meet personally with President-elect Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=18.14s)]
*  It was the first time we have seen him in seven years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=23.84s)]
*  But we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues, and we told him so. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=29.48s)]
*  What we did agree on was to restart communications. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=34.32s)]
*  In this meeting, President Trump was tearful. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=38.76s)]
*  He was upbeat. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=40.94s)]
*  He seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=41.94s)]
*  And for those asking why we would go speak to the President-elect during such fraught [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=49.36s)]
*  times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, why wouldn't we? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=55.24s)]
*  All right, they must have spent three days working on what they were going to say after [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=61.24s)]
*  they had that meeting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=65.72s)]
*  All right, a few days ago, these two far-left radical hosts were comparing Trump to Hitler, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=66.72s)]
*  calling him a racist and sexist and fascist, and now they're kissing his ass, sucking [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=73.28s)]
*  up to him and having breakfast at Donald Trump's house at their request? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=78.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  I said the election was literally a battle of life and death. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=84.4s)]
*  For eight-plus long years, these two Trump haters have filled their morning program with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  anti-Trump hysteria, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  I could fill an entire three-hour show. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=99.22s)]
*  I could do three nights in a row just playing clips of their insane, over-the-top, anti-Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  rage, hatred, name-calling conspiracies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  I am being gracious in the spirit of joy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=114.04s)]
*  I'm only going to make you suffer through a very tiny example to make a point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=116.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=122.12s)]
*  I could go back and talk about Nazi Germany, and I'd do it without any concerns whatsoever. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=123.12s)]
*  If people can't start drawing the parallels, well, you're just stupid or you have your [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=128.72s)]
*  head in the sand, or you're one of them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=132.8s)]
*  It's just staggering that people that I know, people that I grew up with, could still even [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=135.52s)]
*  consider voting for this autocrat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=141.5s)]
*  As important as Trump's fascism is, and is the lead story every day, his cozying up to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  dictators, his obsession with Hitler, but this is what voters know right now, that he [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=151.66s)]
*  is killing us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm talking about us women. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  He's killing us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=164.58s)]
*  Killing them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  The main question tonight is, why would you want to be with the murderer, Adolf Hitler, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=168.42s)]
*  Joseph Stalin and Mussolini? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=171.89999999999998s)]
*  After all that, I'm not sure why Donald Trump would meet with Joe and Mika. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  Maybe the president does want to be magnanimous. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  Maybe he wants to bring the country together. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=181.77999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  When I interview him, I will ask him that question, and if I find out ahead of time, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=185.04s)]
*  I'll bring that answer to you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=189.26s)]
*  Now, can anyone just for a second imagine Kamala Harris agreeing to meet with yours [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=191.14s)]
*  truly after, if she had, God forbid, thank God you didn't let this happen, if she won [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=197.18s)]
*  the election after we spent all that time on this show exposing her, in her own words, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=203.46s)]
*  her radicalism, her extremism, her utter incompetence night after night after night? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=210.66s)]
*  And for the record, by the way, we invited her on this show. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=216.52s)]
*  I offered her three hours of radio, one hour of TV during the campaign. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  We never heard back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=224.94s)]
*  She—and by—and she's still welcome. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=226.14s)]
*  You're going to have three hours of radio, one hour uninterrupted right here on Fox News [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=228.14s)]
*  with me. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=233.26s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=234.42s)]
*  And anyway, it looks like Donald Trump, unlike Kamala and most everyone else on the radical [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=236.3s)]
*  left, is actually serious about trying to unite the country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=241.18s)]
*  My unsolicited advice—not that anyone listens to me, I'm just a talk show host—is that, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=244.66s)]
*  you know, this is a complete waste of time, and it's just going to be a matter of how [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=249.9s)]
*  many days until they start calling you a Nazi and a fascist again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=253.66000000000003s)]
*  But maybe, maybe, just maybe, he's not the monster the state-run legacy media mob portrayed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=256.94s)]
*  Or is it possible they have become enlightened and the light has gone on? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=264.74s)]
*  Maybe they have come to the realization that legacy media, the mob that spoke in unison, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=270.54s)]
*  late night comedy, every major newspaper, liberal cable news channels, three broadcast [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=276.74s)]
*  is completely dead and people have lost all trust in them and they have no influence, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=282.1s)]
*  there's no celebrity influence, because that was proven to be true this election. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=287.3s)]
*  Or maybe they're simply, you know, building out relationships any way, anywhere they can. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=292.22s)]
*  There have been reports that I have read that MSDNC is for sale. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=297.98s)]
*  They might be looking for a job one day. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=303.3s)]
*  Or maybe it's dawning on them that they themselves are the ones that have been dividing this country [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=306.3s)]
*  with their over-the-top conspiracy theories, rage, anger, and hatred, and hyperbole. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=313.22s)]
*  You know, they're friends in the Democratic Party. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=320.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=323.26s)]
*  Now, the country has gone lurching back to the right. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=324.66s)]
*  I hope it's not going as far right as that which happened in Germany in the 1930s. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=328.14s)]
*  But you may remember, I forewarned way back in 2018 that I saw this coming. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=333.98s)]
*  Are you envisioning another Hitler? Is that what you're saying? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=340.1s)]
*  That's exactly what I'm saying. I said the 1930s in Germany. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  And of course, we can go to Mussolini in Italy. These things... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=348.38s)]
*  So you don't think that's a little hyperbolic? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  No, you may think so. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=356.82s)]
*  All right, thankfully, you, the American people, all of you out there, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=360.02000000000004s)]
*  well, tune this kind of insane rhetoric out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=363.82s)]
*  Fewer and fewer Americans believe their lies. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  But that is not stopping far-left radical Democrats from doubling down on dumb and dumber, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=368.94s)]
*  on X, as an act of so-called resistance. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=374.58s)]
*  The Illinois governor, J.B. Pritzker, is now advertising his state as a refuge [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  for anyone who wants to get a sex change operation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  Maybe Kamala herself will pay for it, because she won't be in Washington. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  And she believes so dearly in it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=389.46s)]
*  Instead of spending your money, she can spend hers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=391.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Harvard Crimson, the president of the Institute of Politics, wrote, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=394.14s)]
*  his department could no longer be nonpartisan, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=399.3s)]
*  vowing to resist the incoming administration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=402.5s)]
*  For the record, I would argue they've always been partisan. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=405.86s)]
*  And get this, the hosts on that hard-hitting ABC News, Disney, Bob Iger show, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=409.18s)]
*  were enraged that Joe and Mika met with Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=414.86s)]
*  And on MSDNC, Jen Psaki is looking for ways to silence Americans [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=418.06s)]
*  that she disagrees with on social media. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=423.02s)]
*  Either you think like she thinks, or you're going to be silenced. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=426.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=430.29999999999995s)]
*  One of the things that's changed, even since I got involved in politics, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=431.26s)]
*  is just the rise of the percentage of people who get their information off of platforms [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=434.74s)]
*  that have no fact-checking mechanism and no accountability for having disinformation spread. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  How does it change? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=446.74s)]
*  How are people held to account? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  Laws have to change? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=450.3s)]
*  I don't even know the total answer to it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=451.58s)]
*  Jen, people don't trust you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  They don't trust the network you work for. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=457.34s)]
*  Because all of your conspiracy theories have been debunked, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=460.02s)]
*  all of the lies you told, nobody bought them, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=463.62s)]
*  and you keep spewing them day in and day out. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=466.82s)]
*  Now, despite the panic, the fear-mongering, the hatred, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  especially targeting Donald Trump's appointments and nominees, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=472.74s)]
*  this is what is actually going to happen. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=476.5s)]
*  There's going to be change in Washington, and the border will get secured. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=479.46s)]
*  And that means criminals, asylum abusers, those murderers, rapists, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=484.58s)]
*  gang members, cartel members, people with terror ties that are in our country, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=490.42s)]
*  unvetted, harassed, fighting illegals. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=495.42s)]
*  They will all get deported. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=498.14s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  And something conservatives, we have said for decades [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=501.94s)]
*  that we want to have happen is about to happen, too. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=505.38s)]
*  America's massive, bloated, power-hungry, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=508.14s)]
*  left-wing bureaucracies will be held accountable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  The words limited government will now mean something. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=514.98s)]
*  Greater freedom will mean something. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=518.06s)]
*  And hopefully, we can get this done as we speak. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=520.66s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, Elon Musk, they are hunting for waste and fraud [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=523.02s)]
*  and abuse through the new Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  An op-ed in The Wall Street Journal recommended that they start [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=530.38s)]
*  by tossing the Federal Communications Commission, the FTC, the SEC, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  the Department of Agriculture, the Postal Service. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=539.54s)]
*  Yeah, give it to UPS. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=542.54s)]
*  Give it to, you know, give it to anybody except them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=543.86s)]
*  The Labor Department, HUD, the Interior Department, the VA. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=548.86s)]
*  Yeah, vets need the money. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=553.0999999999999s)]
*  Give it directly to them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=555.18s)]
*  And of course, the EPA, just to name a few. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=557.02s)]
*  Now, keep in mind the Department of Education is also very much [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=559.6999999999999s)]
*  on the cutting board. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=562.62s)]
*  Let the states run it with standards, get woke out of schools, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=563.9s)]
*  and go back to reading, writing, math, science and real history. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=568.62s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=572.02s)]
*  This doesn't mean important services will go away. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=573.38s)]
*  Democrats, the legacy media mob will lie about what is about to happen. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=576.82s)]
*  It is going to be an earthquake that has been needed and necessary [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=581.78s)]
*  and discussed for decades in Washington to change the country for the better. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=586.18s)]
*  And things are not going to be business as usual with a bunch of bureaucrats [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=591.5s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  And they will resist themselves, and they will do everything in their power [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=596.5400000000001s)]
*  to stop Donald Trump from making changes this country has needed for a long time. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=600.1s)]
*  And by the way, they would just be managed on the local level, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  the state level, without an army of Washington bureaucrats, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=608.9000000000001s)]
*  highly paid, writing regulations and getting in the way, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=612.38s)]
*  telling you what refrigerator you can have, what washer and dryer you can have, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=616.02s)]
*  what car you're allowed to put in your driveway, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=619.74s)]
*  Hopefully, the reforms won't stop there. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=623.1400000000001s)]
*  R.A. Fleischer had a great idea. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=626.1400000000001s)]
*  He's now arguing a shakeup in the White House press briefing room, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=627.74s)]
*  giving front row seats to, quote, conservative media outlets outside [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=631.22s)]
*  the Beltway outlets, podcasters, talk radio reporters, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=635.1400000000001s)]
*  respectable social media influencers, instead of legacy media outlets [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  that hate Donald Trump and nobody seems to care what they think anyway, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=645.38s)]
*  and that all they do is actively work to smear him. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=649.38s)]
*  As Ari points out, if Trump really wants to change DC, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=652.3s)]
*  he needs to change the status quo and unseat the mainstream media. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=656.5s)]
*  I agree. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=660.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, a much bigger overhaul is needed at the Pentagon. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=661.78s)]
*  After falling short of recruiting goals, losing track of hundreds of billions [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=664.66s)]
*  of dollars, letting woke politics interfere with important work [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=668.58s)]
*  of national security, it is time for a massive shakeup at that department. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=672.42s)]
*  It won't be easy. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  Military preparedness is now a massive problem. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=678.14s)]
*  When China and Russia have hypersonic technology and we don't, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=682.22s)]
*  that deficiency needs to be rectified immediately, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=687.3s)]
*  and we better spend the money to fix it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=690.78s)]
*  And breaking, you know, with usual norms, Biden is already trying to, what, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=693.06s)]
*  box Trump in with his latest authorization in Ukraine, supplying the country [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=697.22s)]
*  last minute out the door with long-range missiles to escalate the battle [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=702.0999999999999s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine so Ukraine can attack the interior of Russia, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=707.8599999999999s)]
*  knowing Donald Trump wants to end this war. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=713.02s)]
*  And so Biden is actively undermining Trump's chances of success, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=716.14s)]
*  while simultaneously increasing the odds of a broader conflict in Europe, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=720.6199999999999s)]
*  while also denying help to our biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=725.2199999999999s)]
*  There is no doubt Donald Trump is inheriting an absolute mess from Biden [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  and Harris, both at home and abroad, but you, the American people, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=734.86s)]
*  elected the guy that is going to go in, he's going to fix what's broken, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=739.3s)]
*  the left will scream bloody murder, the institutionalists won't like it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=743.78s)]
*  It is exactly what he intends to do and it is exactly what the country voted for. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y5vHi04HGk&t=749.54s)]
