# Sean Hannity: Democrats are making fools out of themselves
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight, another round of confirmation hearings and another round of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  humiliation for Democrats that just make them fools of themselves every day. Across town at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=5.12s)]
*  the White House, even more public shame for Democrats after a mumbling, bumbling, delusional [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=10.4s)]
*  farewell address from Joe Biden that no one, I promise you, will ever remember. Our dear friend, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith, called it sad, and apparently he now regrets voting for Kamala Harris. Why didn't [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=21.84s)]
*  he listen to me in the beginning? I'll ask him in just a moment. But let's be clear. Stephen A. is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=28.32s)]
*  not the only Democratic voter with regrets. Joe Biden is leaving office with a record [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=33.28s)]
*  low approval rating, a vast majority of you, the American people, believe his presidency was a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=38.64s)]
*  failure. It was. And today he needed a lot of help just walking into a room. It's sad. It's humiliating. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=45.28s)]
*  What a terrible end to a terrible four years. And tragically, his biggest failure will likely be felt [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=53.76s)]
*  years to come as all of his unvetted, illegal immigrants continue to commit murders and rapes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  and other violent crimes and the known terrorists that he has allowed into our country continue to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=68.56s)]
*  plot, plan, scheme and attack on our homeland. I pray to God that this never happens, but it probably [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=74.56s)]
*  will. The odds are very high. And when it does, the blood will be on Joe's hands, Kamala's hands, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=81.52s)]
*  Mayorca's hands and frankly, all of the other law enforcement that turned a blind eye not to enforce [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=88.8s)]
*  the law. And I'm not talking about rank and file members of law enforcement. And meanwhile, Trump has [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  never been more popular. Recent Fox News polls showing a majority of Americans approving of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=100.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's transition. And that's not all. Once scorned by much of the corporate world, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=105.6s)]
*  while business leaders are now lining up to meet with Donald Trump, donate big dollars to his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=111.36s)]
*  inauguration. In fact, Donald Trump's inaugural committee is now breaking records with donations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  from almost every major company in the country. It's a new reality. Democrats, the media mob, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  they never saw this coming. Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, is Donald, it's Donald Trump that is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=128.8s)]
*  uniting the country. And needless to say, many on the left, they're not happy. This is their worst [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=135.52s)]
*  nightmare becoming their reality. Apparently, 84-year-old, 20-term swamp monster, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  she can't bear, oh, the vapors. Oh, she can't handle it. She's not going to be attending Trump's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  inauguration. I don't think anybody will care. Neither will Michelle Obama, according to reports. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=154.48s)]
*  She has a very bad case of Trump derangement syndrome and is so filled with hate, she is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=160.16s)]
*  refusing to go. Does anybody really care? I know I don't. The Trump team, they don't seem too [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=165.76s)]
*  bothered either. They are reportedly having a good laugh at her expense. And of course, no one is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  really surprised by Michelle Obama's behavior. According to Melania Trump, this is very revealing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=176.88s)]
*  The Obamas were not exactly helpful or courteous during the first transition to the White House [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=183.04s)]
*  in 2017. Watch this. Behind the scenes, what is it like when you're moving back in the White House? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=190.16s)]
*  Are you, what's different this time? The difference is I know where I will be going. I know the rooms [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  where we will be living. I know the process. The first time was challenging. We didn't have much [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=202.64s)]
*  of the information. The information was upheld for us from previous administration, but this time [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=209.52s)]
*  I have everything. Wow. Now, make no mistake, we are witnessing history. This was a historic [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  political victory, perhaps the biggest in the country's history, and only made possible. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  And we need to stop and pause and thank all of you, the American people. The cards, they were [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=233.28s)]
*  absolutely stacked against Donald Trump. He had the deep state against him, big tech, a weaponized [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=238.16s)]
*  DOJ, the media mob, academia, all the Democratic Party, all tried to destroy him. After nine [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=244.0s)]
*  straight years of lying and slander and character assassination, he prevailed. And now Americans of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=251.84s)]
*  all different backgrounds, they are waking up. They are realizing they have been lied to by [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=258.64s)]
*  Democrats. They have been lied to by the legacy media. They have been lied to by unelected [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=263.2s)]
*  bureaucrats, people that have abused power for years. Now, our friend Stephen A. Smith even admits [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=268.08s)]
*  he was misinformed about the 2024 election. Take a look at this. And I did not vote for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=274.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, unlike people that suddenly turned around and kissing his ring and, you know, trying [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=279.84s)]
*  to feign like they're suddenly a supporter of his. No, I did not vote for him. But I got to tell [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  you something. I'm not Maddie Warren. Let's call it what it is. There's a lot of people that won't [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=291.2s)]
*  admit this. I'm going to admit it. I was a bit misinformed. Let's call it what it is. And that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=297.36s)]
*  pressure emanating from my community, I'm tired of it. I think that's one of the reasons you see me [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=307.76s)]
*  sound. And Patrick Bedd-David alluded to that as well, talking about me. And they're right. They're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  right. Well, Stephen A. in just a moment. Here's the truth. Kamala Harris might have been a better [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=317.84s)]
*  candidate than her mentally inept, cognitively declining boss, Joe Biden, but she would have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  been a terrible president. She's far more radical left than Joe. We pointed that out. Very few [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  people wanted a report on it. The legacy media ignored it all. They were all in on all things, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=334.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris. They never vetted her. And that's why people don't trust them anymore. That's why [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=341.2s)]
*  she was a terrible vice president. That's why she was not a good border czar, a terrible senator [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=346.64s)]
*  and frankly not a good lawyer or prosecutor. And now, like so many other losers, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=352.32s)]
*  and far left lawyers, she's reportedly planning a New York City lifestyle and cashing in on a book [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=357.68s)]
*  deal that probably few people will be interested in and likely to purchase. But according to, well, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=365.84s)]
*  the ever giggling vice president, she is refusing to go quietly into the night. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=371.84s)]
*  I would advise her to reconsider. Take a look. As you all have heard me say many times, I am fully [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=377.52s)]
*  aware that I am the public face of a lot of our work. And so I have the benefit of running into [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=384.56s)]
*  people all over our country who thank me. And I will tell you, I am fully aware that when they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  are thanking me, they are thanking our team and our work is not done. And as you all know me, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=398.24s)]
*  because we have spent long hours, long days and months and years together, it is not my nature to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  go quietly into the night. So don't worry about that. She's going to move back to the community [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  where she will live in a community of people that share a community for the community sake. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=419.68s)]
*  Despite all these words about herself, it is safe to say Kamala Harris's political career is over. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=426.96s)]
*  Although I will say this, she has a very good chance of being California's next governor. She [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=432.32s)]
*  fit right in in California. Now we just hope she can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Dpbao6QhQ&t=437.36s)]
