# Hannity: Kamala Harris owes you some answers
**Fox News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig)
*  an election year conversion. We're getting like one or two a day. And that's where a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=0.0s)]
*  dishonest fake politician that wants power, that is highly ambitious, will say and do [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=4.84s)]
*  anything to get elected. But if her positions have truly changed, then she owes you some [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=12.08s)]
*  answers. Why does she no longer support her mandatory federal gun buyback, ostensibly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  gun confiscation? Why does she no longer support Medicare for All, her plan that she co-sponsored [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=25.5s)]
*  in the Senate that would eliminate all private health insurance? Why does she no longer support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=31.34s)]
*  government guaranteed jobs? That was a big part of the New Green Deal that, again, she [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=36.58s)]
*  co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Kennedy said to our friend and colleague, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=41.14s)]
*  Neil Cavuto, Kamala is AOC without the bartending experience. So why does Kamala no longer support [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=46.14s)]
*  a ban on fracking, something she proclaimed many, many, many times? Why does she no longer [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=53.62s)]
*  support defunding the police and directing funds away from police department? Why is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=59.14s)]
*  she no longer tweeting out the bail front after the Minneapolis police precinct was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=65.46s)]
*  burned to the ground? And Kamala, are you still against deporting illegal immigrants? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=70.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=75.58s)]
*  I will say, no, absolutely not. They should not be deported. And I actually, this was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=77.74s)]
*  one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration. I was Attorney General [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=82.38s)]
*  of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=89.38s)]
*  to the United States Department of Justice in a state of 40 million people. And on this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=93.84s)]
*  issue I disagreed with my president because the policy was to allow deportation of people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals. So as Attorney General and the Chief Law Officer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=104.98s)]
*  of the State of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=111.6s)]
*  not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=116.88s)]
*  of public safety of their community. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=122.6s)]
*  The border with your borders are is an unmitigated disaster. So why does Kamala still support [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  sanctuary cities and states? Why won't she say people that enter our country illegally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=131.12s)]
*  are criminals? Why is Kamala forcing you, the American people already strapped by her [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=136.4s)]
*  and Joe Biden's record high inflation to pay for illegal immigrants and their healthcare [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=141.62s)]
*  and their education and their housing? And the most important question, Kamala, what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  do you say to all of the families, all of the families who loved ones were murdered, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  those that had family members raped, other victims of other crimes committed by the nearly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  11 million unvetted illegal immigrants that you and Joe let into this country? What do [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=162.5s)]
*  you say to them? When will you apologize to them? How do you ever answer the question [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=167.86s)]
*  about how you have allowed all of these people from nearly 180 countries into our country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=172.7s)]
*  with the promise of free healthcare and education and housing, people from countries that have [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=179.06s)]
*  terror ties, countries that are our top geopolitical foes? You would think that someone in the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=184.38s)]
*  media mob might be a little curious and want answers from the border czar. As a matter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=190.06s)]
*  of fact, you would think that an honest press would want all of you, the American people, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=196.46s)]
*  to get an honest explanation for all of Kamala's flipping and flopping and flailing, but nope, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=201.9s)]
*  silence from fake news, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSDNC. Instead, they would rather ask Senator [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=207.38s)]
*  Tom Cotton negative questions about Donald Trump. Watch this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=214.3s)]
*  How does her changing her views on her policy justify having the presumptive, the Republican [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=218.98s)]
*  nominee questioning her race? How does that, does that increase or decrease your party's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=224.78s)]
*  chances of winning in November? Well, well, Caitlin, you haven't had that conversation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=229.22s)]
*  with Kamala Harris because she's been hiding out. I want to have this conversation with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=235.06s)]
*  you, Senator. Joe Biden hit out before her. I'm and my point is, when are you and the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  rest of the media going to demand that Kamala Harris come out and answer questions in an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=243.14s)]
*  unscripted format about where she stands for this country, as opposed to continuing to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=247.7s)]
*  focus on what Donald Trump said today? Perfect answer. Senator Cotton. Great job. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=252.14s)]
*  He's right. Kamala has enjoyed a free pass for years, but she's now running for the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=258.14s)]
*  presidency of the United States of America, will be nominated to the DNC without winning [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=262.42s)]
*  a single primary vote. No problem. Talk about democracy in peril. Every disenfranchised [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=267.62s)]
*  Democratic primary voter, they don't care about you. So it might be nice if Kamala can [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=273.98s)]
*  summon the courage to tell voters about all of the radical things she has said in her [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  own words without reading a teleprompter. The state run media mob is a corrupt institution. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=283.62s)]
*  I said in 2007 and eight journalism is dead. They are nothing but a political extension [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  of all things leftist, radical, Democrats, state run media, modern day Pravda. But shouldn't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  we at least expect the bare minimum from a major party candidate? Don't we deserve that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=302.1s)]
*  Maybe she could even try to appear on Fox News if she's capable of serving as president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=307.66s)]
*  Surely she's capable of taking a few questions from from Brett and Martha, who are great [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=312.34s)]
*  at their job on this network. And meanwhile, the speculation is now growing over who Kamala [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=317.9s)]
*  Harris will select as a running mate. Now, according to reports, it's down to Senator [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=323.58s)]
*  Mark Kelly from Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who just canceled all of his [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=328.06s)]
*  scheduled events to fundraise in New York and the Hamptons this weekend. Now, Shapiro [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  is a deeply controversial pick for the Democratic Party. Now, sadly, the the party's far left [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=338.7s)]
*  anti-Semitic base, they don't like Governor Shapiro for all the wrong reasons. And as [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=345.46s)]
*  Michael Moore warned, this pick could be disastrous for them in 2024. Take a look. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  Vice President Harris appoints Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential candidate. And this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=356.66s)]
*  too may result in losing Michigan. Shapiro said that it's, quote, anti-Semitic for anyone [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  to join the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel in order to convince [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  them to stop their apartheid behavior. He has also cruelly compared the peaceful college [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  students to the Ku Klux Klan because they were calling for an end to the slaughter in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=382.16s)]
*  Gaza. Actions like these will diminish the Arab-American vote for Harris and depress [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  a large swath of the youth vote throughout the country. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, despite all the glowing coverage of Kamala Harris, the Democrats, they have a real problem. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  Their party is deeply fractured and extreme, and Kamala, she's not capable of bringing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  them together. In fact, she couldn't even unite her own staff. The turnover rate, a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=408.08s)]
*  whopping 90% with a work environment that was described as extremely toxic. And the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=413.08s)]
*  administration she helped lead was among the most divisive in American history. When the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=418.64s)]
*  protective state-run media bubble is finally punctured and Kamala is forced to answer tough [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=423.52s)]
*  questions, it's likely not going to go well. She's no Barack Obama and she's no Bill Clinton. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=428.96s)]
*  And she served side by side with the president even worse than Jimmy Carter. She owns that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=434.88s)]
*  record and in the coming weeks, we will do our, their job and our job, hold her feet [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  to the fire, demand answers, and we'll do the same for whoever she chooses to be her [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=444.44s)]
*  running mate. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbxHwsq4yig&t=449.32s)]
