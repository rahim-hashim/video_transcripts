*  What a concept you know they got the message in the election just like everyone did the the the American people had enough of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=107.42s)]
*  Radical woke progressive agenda they delivered Donald J. Trump a 77 million popular vote outcome [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=113.67999999999999s)]

*  Let me ask all of you in the room you understand that you win or lose together [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=129.01999999999998s)]

*  Nobody here will get everything that they want do we understand that too? Yes everybody gets that Jim Jordan even agrees [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=142.54s)]
*  So we'll talk to Jim in a minute [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=148.34s)]
*  but if [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=150.98s)]
*  People understand that when you talk to members and I know there are people that are giving you a hard time and you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=152.86s)]
*  Explain this concept to them are they open to hearing you? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=159.42s)]
*  Yes, everybody is we were having family conversations. That's part of it. We're a great deliberative body. It's raw food. No, no food [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=163.62s)]
*  No, no, no pencils, but no [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=169.94s)]
*  We're in these rooms with whiteboards working it out. Everybody has different ideas, but our principles are the same [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=172.26s)]
*  We want to scale down the size and scope of government. We want to get the border secured [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=177.62s)]
*  We want to unleash American energy again get back to energy dominance and unleash the US economy again [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=181.06s)]
*  We got to make sure that we don't have the largest tax increase in US history [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=186.82s)]
*  Which is what would happen if we fail in this mission by the end of this year a lot of things on the table [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=189.62s)]
*  But we all know that we know how high the stakes are and we are going to deliver for the people. Okay [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=194.3s)]
*  When you look at that insider advantage poll, I think it speaks volumes. Yeah, they want this unity [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=199.82s)]
*  It seems that the agenda that they're saying that they want is the Trump agenda [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=205.5s)]
*  Yes, Trump agenda if you really break it down, you know to its simplest form is not that complicated [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=209.78s)]
*  If implemented it would be transform transformational [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=216.3s)]
*  It would and it follows common sense [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=219.9s)]
*  That's the theme that you'll hear him talking about and all of us talking about we all ran on that agenda [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=221.94s)]
*  We were in our districts and that's how we delivered that decisive outcome in the election [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  What this is is getting America back making America great again. It's not just a slogan [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=230.58s)]
*  It's what we're actually going to accomplish and it is going to be a new golden age in America and we can't wait to get that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=235.26s)]
*  Thing going let me talk a little bit [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=240.38s)]
*  Probably the two biggest issues in the campaign had to do a border security the economy [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's one one thing that I think really hurt the Democrats is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=247.5s)]
*  They were in denial and flat-out lied to us repeatedly saying the border is secure and the borders closed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=251.62s)]
*  It was never closed. We showed it every night. Joe was a cognitive mess for four years [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=257.22s)]
*  I put on the best montages we've ever put on television that late blank late night comic should have used [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=262.94s)]
*  They lied about inflation being transitory [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=270.42s)]
*  The average family is struggling the cost of gasoline is a buck 25 buck 50 more a gallon [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=273.26s)]
*  I mean these are real impactful issues for the people in Ohio and Indiana and Texas and all around our great country and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=278.38s)]
*  I think that was a big part of it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=286.06s)]
*  People are gonna want results. They want them pretty fast now starting with the border. We have known terrorists in the country [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=288.9s)]
*  We have cartel members in the country. We have gang members in the country. We have known murderers [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=296.26s)]
*  We have known rapists in the country. Okay remain in Mexico comes back. Love it build the wall. Love it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=301.42s)]
*  All those things are important. How do you possibly in a country of this size? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=308.38s)]
*  find the people from Iran and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=314.5s)]
*  Syria and Afghanistan Egypt and and Venezuela and Russia and China and get them the hell out of here [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=317.38s)]
*  It's a serious challenge, but it will be our focus [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=323.62s)]
*  We're gonna begin with the dangerous criminals that we can find pretty easily [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=326.22s)]
*  Many of them have committed crimes in the country [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  Of course some violent acts upon Americans and that's what the American people demand and deserve immediately that starts now [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=331.22s)]
*  Those executive orders were to jumpstart it and we'll be codifying a lot of what the president has already signed and we will fund this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=337.3s)]
*  We will we will restore the safety and security of the country for the American people if you don't have a border [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=343.54s)]
*  You don't even have sovereignty and that's what people recognized in the election [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=348.82000000000005s)]
*  They weren't buying the nonsense that the Democratic Party was selling. What do you do about cities and states? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  There are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=357.74s)]
*  Sanctuary safe havens for illegal immigrants [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=359.54s)]
*  Well, one of the things we have here is the is the purse strings, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  That's the power of the purse and we've got to bring them to heal these cities that have led to this chaos that created the humanitarian [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=365.82s)]
*  Catastrophe that came from that border that we'll be living with for decades [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=372.38s)]
*  It's going to take us a long time to unwind this but to your point the American people need to see immediate results [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=375.38s)]
*  They're going to see resolve here. They're going to see action not just talk and that's already begun [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let's let's get go to a specific example our old friend Gavin Newsom, okay a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=384.9s)]
*  Lot of Gavin fans here. I can tell I [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=391.54s)]
*  Actually feel sorry for the people in California that were yeah. Sure. What do they lose 13,000 structures? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=394.74s)]
*  I mean, it's terrible and they never practiced the the science of forestry [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=400.62s)]
*  No, how do you have a fire hydrant that has no water? How do you have a reservoir that is empty? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=404.68s)]
*  Yeah, that is government to me at its worst, right? Right. They didn't have control burns [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=409.5s)]
*  They didn't clear the kindling the brush that was that you should be clearing out and but you go to California [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=413.5s)]
*  They're a sanctuary state LA and San Francisco or sanctuary cities. Yeah, okay [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=419.9s)]
*  Gavin is is doubling down on a fight Trump agenda, you know Trump proved, California [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=425.46s)]
*  right and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=432.42s)]
*  So are you saying that you that California if they continue to aid and abet lawbreaking and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=433.62s)]
*  Harbor illegal immigrants money from DC gets cut off. Yeah, we're at we're talking about conditions to this disaster [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=441.02s)]
*  Look, they're they're natural disasters, but there are man-made disasters as well and they made terrible decisions [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=447.42s)]
*  You know, they knew exactly what they were doing that reservoir outside Pacific Palisades 117 million gallons [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=453.36s)]
*  It was empty for a year. Why they were trying to save a smelt fish or something [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=459.38s)]
*  I mean their policies are upside down they made decisions that made that disaster [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=463.14s)]
*  Exponentially worse and this is what the American taxpayer is demanding of us everywhere else in the country [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=468.06s)]
*  But take it a step further. Yeah [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  Represent any representatives from California here anybody one. Okay [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=475.18s)]
*  Hi, he's bashful [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=480.18s)]
*  That's Gavin's cousin in the back. No, I'm kidding. I'm teasing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=482.90000000000003s)]
*  Congressman and women from California Republicans will come and say if you do this to my state I'll never win reelection [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=489.38s)]
*  No, the Californians that are here are fiscal conservatives, they're fiscally responsible [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=495.38s)]
*  They know that we owe the taxpayer some accountability for those funds [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=500.2s)]
*  And so what we're talking about is making sure that they follow common sense in California [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  And if there's culpability for what happened there really needs to be conditions that follow that aid [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=507.61999999999995s)]
*  It's not unprecedented by the way after Katrina and my stuff there were conditions placed upon the funds [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=511.94s)]
*  It happened after Hurricane Sandy up in the Northeast. So there's a tradition of doing this and in California. It certainly makes sense [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=517.22s)]
*  So we're gonna come to consensus on what the conditions be tied to defund dismantle no bail laws [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=523.62s)]
*  I think I look I think all those issues have to be addressed when you're talking about disaster aid [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=528.5s)]
*  You don't want to leave the people, you know [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=532.94s)]
*  Who are really hurting without something because of the terrible political choices of their leaders [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=534.62s)]
*  But we've got it. We got to thread that needle the right way [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=538.9s)]
*  But I think that what we're talking about here is restoring common sense even in the state of California, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=540.98s)]
*  The mandate we have the responsibility we have we're gonna do that very thing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=546.18s)]

*  There's a reason for that. We prioritize spending and we make sure that we maintain peace through strength [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=596.64s)]
*  We've got a new commander-in-chief a new sheriff in town. He's gonna bring that back and we're gonna help [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=601.8399999999999s)]

*  And I have it fully domiciled homesteaded. But the question is, you know [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=627.12s)]
*  Because of the energy emergency declaration of the president with that then [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=633.4s)]
*  With the supremacy clause kick in in as much as the federal government would have the right to insist that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  Fracking take place in a state like New York, which would make them rich. Yeah, so I'm a constitutional law attorney [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etAg_W2sco8&t=645.4799999999999s)]
