# Sean Hannity: Biden was the centerpiece of the family's influence peddling
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg)
*  All right, not long ago, Hunter Biden begged for a public hearing before Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, the president's unscrupulous adult son said that he wanted to clear his good name [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  in front of the bright light of Capitol Hill. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=9.58s)]
*  But today, Hunter was a no-show, rejecting the invitation to testify publicly before [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=12.26s)]
*  the House Oversight Committee. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=17.52s)]
*  Well, in his place, an empty chair, along with his former business associates, Tony [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=19.04s)]
*  Bobulinski, who put focus squarely on the big guy himself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=28.44s)]
*  Joe Biden was more than a participant in and a beneficiary of his family's business. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=29.72s)]
*  He was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=33.8s)]
*  the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=39.48s)]
*  Mr. Bobulinski, who's the big guy? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=46.28s)]
*  Are you sure about that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=49.64s)]
*  Because when — [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=50.64s)]
*  Jordan, Joe Biden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=51.64s)]
*  You're sure? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=52.64s)]
*  I'm a thousand percent sure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=53.64s)]
*  Because when Hunter Biden did his deposition under oath, he said, I don't know who it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=55.16s)]
*  is, even though he was copied on an email that said, H will hold 10 percent for the big guy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=58.52s)]
*  You're sure it's the big guy? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=63.64s)]
*  Is Joe Biden? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=64.64s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=65.64s)]
*  And there's other text messages that back that up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=66.64s)]
*  Now, of course, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rushed to Biden's defense, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  but as it turns out, she's not exactly a legal scholar or well-versed on the issues. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=76.88s)]
*  Decide for yourself. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=82.56s)]
*  Did you witness the president commit a crime? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=83.56s)]
*  Is it your testimony today? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=87.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=89.08s)]
*  And what crime do you have you witness? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=90.08s)]
*  How much time do I have to go through it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=93.24s)]
*  It is simple. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  You name the crime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  Did you watch him steal something? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=97.28s)]
*  Corruption statutes, Rico and conspiracy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=100.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=102.44s)]
*  What is the crime, sir? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=103.44s)]
*  Specifically. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=106.08s)]
*  You just — you keep — you asked me to answer the question. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=107.08s)]
*  I answered the question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=110.32s)]
*  Rico, you're obviously not familiar with. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=111.32s)]
*  Corruption statutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=113.8s)]
*  Excuse me, sir. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=114.8s)]
*  Excuse me, sir. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=115.8s)]
*  Rico is not a crime. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=116.84s)]
*  It is a category. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=120.24s)]
*  What is the crime? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=121.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=122.24s)]
*  It's the category of crimes that you're then charged over — [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=123.24s)]
*  You have charges. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=125.64s)]
*  — a long hundred — [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=126.64s)]
*  You have charges. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=127.64s)]
*  Sir, please name — [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=128.64s)]
*  You want me to name the exact statute on Rico? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=129.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=132.64s)]
*  Okay, Rico's not a crime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=133.64s)]
*  All right, that case out in Fulton County, Georgia, against Trump is bogus. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=136.64s)]
*  Thank you, Congresswoman. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=140.72s)]
*  We appreciate the insight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=141.76s)]
*  Maybe Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez should spend a little less time breathlessly defending [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=143.44s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  See those images right there? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  Maybe she should spend more time in her home district, where the streets are lined with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=151.24s)]
*  garbage while prostitutes and illegal immigrants, well, post up on every block. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=156.16s)]
*  And despite what you just heard from AOC, according to Bob Olinsky and other key witnesses, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=162.72s)]
*  Biden was the centerpiece of the family's international influence peddling. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=167.44s)]
*  He was the brand. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  And yet, as far as we know, the House of Representatives is the only group seriously investigating [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=173.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=178.12s)]
*  Nothing from the DOJ, nothing from the FBI, nothing from the IRS. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=179.12s)]
*  You know, it's perfectly normal for a vice president to leverage a billion dollars, give [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  a country like Ukraine six hours to fire a prosecutor. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  Son of a B, they do it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=193.16s)]
*  And the result is his son continues to get paid for what he said on Good Morning America [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=194.68s)]
*  he had no experience in — Ukraine, or energy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=199.32s)]
*  At a time, he later admits that he was addicted to drugs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=202.56s)]
*  Apparently, the three-letter agencies of our federal government saved also their scrutiny [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=205.48s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=210.88s)]
*  Trump now faces dozens of charges, including an unprecedented and bizarre case out of New [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=212.6s)]
*  York, the case brought by the New York attorney general, who proudly campaigned on getting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=217.36s)]
*  Trump, as Professor Dershowitz says. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=223.24s)]
*  Once elected, she accused the former president of fraud, charged him with inflating the value [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=226.56s)]
*  of his real estate portfolio in order to obtain loans and better insurance rates. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, the far-left judge agreed and has now ordered President Trump to pay [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=235.6s)]
*  what is an unprecedented half a billion dollar bond just for the right to appeal the case. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=240.08s)]
*  Keep in mind, no bank lost any money on these loans. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=246.84s)]
*  Nobody even complained. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=250.68s)]
*  The payments were all made in full. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=252.6s)]
*  Now, the banks and insurance companies, they all had a fiduciary responsibility to do their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=254.6s)]
*  own valuations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  And to top that off, the Trump Organization had in every single deal they made a disclaimer [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=261.04s)]
*  that was given to all banks and all insurance companies not to use the Trump Organization's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=267.0s)]
*  valuations. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=272.48s)]
*  And as it turns out, the only person who took exception to these valuations was the far-left [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=273.48s)]
*  judge, the guy without any real estate experience, who actually valued Mar-a-Lago at a mere $18 [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  million. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=287.4s)]
*  When you have small lots, that's 22 plus acres there, it's on the ocean and on the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=288.4s)]
*  intercoastal, you have, you know, oceanfront lots, two acres, selling for $200 million. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=293.0s)]
*  In one case, I don't know if they sold it yet, another one, an acre and a half, for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  $150 million, and that's not even right on the ocean. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=303.76s)]
*  You extrapolate out just the 22 acres of Mar-a-Lago, and it would be worth not the $18 million, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  the judge claimed, but closer to a billion. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=312.32s)]
*  The New York attorney general, the judge, they didn't care, they don't care. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=314.92s)]
*  Remember, the AG promised to get Trump, and now she is reportedly planning to seize Trump [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=318.56s)]
*  Tower if the 45th president fails to produce the $500 million in cash by Monday for the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=323.84s)]
*  right to appeal this verdict. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOYamHEoXg&t=330.28s)]
