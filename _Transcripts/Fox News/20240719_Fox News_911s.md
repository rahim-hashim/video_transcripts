# Hannity: The momentum behind Trump is unlike anything we've witnessed
**Fox News:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight we are at the end of a momentous week for Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republican Party, and the millions of Americans who want to get our country back [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=7.08s)]
*  on track. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=11.48s)]
*  Coming up tonight, Hulk Hogan will join us to recap his pretty electric speech at the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=12.68s)]
*  RNC. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=17.6s)]
*  But the main event was last night's keynote speech from Donald Trump that capped a powerful [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=18.68s)]
*  convention. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=25.04s)]
*  We're centered around courage, liberty, unity, keeping America safe, and the American dream. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=26.04s)]
*  Only days after Donald Trump was nearly killed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=34.68s)]
*  Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=35.68s)]
*  again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  all fellow citizens. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=51.26s)]
*  Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=59.26s)]
*  back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before, and we're going to do [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=64.9s)]
*  it very rapidly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=70.66s)]
*  I'm here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation, to every citizen, whether you're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=72.28s)]
*  a young or old man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, black or white, Asian or Hispanic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=77.74s)]
*  I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  before. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  And during his remarks, former President Trump did pay tribute to the brave firefighter that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  was murdered at President Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, sharing a stage [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=103.14s)]
*  with his uniform. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=109.66s)]
*  He was killed while shielding his family from a hail of bullets. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=111.02s)]
*  Now make no mistake, Saturday's violence puts a lot of things into perspective. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=114.9s)]
*  And now it appears that the Republican Party, that they are more united, more determined [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=119.38s)]
*  than ever before. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=124.16s)]
*  Take a look at this video put together by a Trump supporter on X. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=125.8s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=129.78s)]
*  Let me tell you something you already know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=131.42s)]
*  The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=134.1s)]
*  It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=136.66s)]
*  your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=141.7s)]
*  You, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=144.9s)]
*  But it ain't about how hard you hit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=149.06s)]
*  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=151.28s)]
*  How much you can take and keep moving forward. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=154.86s)]
*  That's how winning is done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=158.46s)]
*  That iconic video and of course that speech from Sylvester Stallone in his Rocky movie. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=164.9s)]
*  Now the momentum behind Donald Trump is unlike anything we have ever witnessed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=171.38s)]
*  But with only 108 days until election day, only 59 days until early voting begins in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=175.62s)]
*  Pennsylvania and then around the country, a very different scene is playing out across [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  the aisle where the atmosphere is downright dismal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=187.42s)]
*  Fake news CNN, well, Van Jones, he kind of summed it up pretty perfectly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=191.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=195.26s)]
*  Today is a terrible day. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=196.26s)]
*  If you just if you pull back and look at this thing, strength versus weakness, a bullet [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=199.26s)]
*  couldn't stop Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=204.78s)]
*  A virus just stopped Biden. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=206.78s)]
*  You got the nominees of this party getting their butts kissed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=209.5s)]
*  Biden's getting his butt kicked by his own party. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=215.98s)]
*  The Democrats are coming apart. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=219.26s)]
*  The Republicans are coming together. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=221.78s)]
*  Hey, listen, hey guys, the last time I was in a commission that felt like this was Obama [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=223.26s)]
*  2008. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=228.66s)]
*  There's something happening where. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=229.66s)]
*  You just wrote a headline. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=232.66s)]
*  What's that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=233.66s)]
*  You just wrote a headline. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=234.66s)]
*  Donald Trump, he got hit with a bullet, but top Democrats have treated their own candidate, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=237.06s)]
*  like dead men walking. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=242.1s)]
*  And for weeks, Operation Bump, Dump and Destroy Joe Biden has been in full effect. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=244.1s)]
*  Now, through targeted leaks, public statements, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, the congenital [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=249.98s)]
*  liar Adam Schiff have all urged Biden to drop out of the race. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=256.02s)]
*  And interestingly, behind the screen, behind the curtain is Barack Hussein Obama. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=260.26s)]
*  Although earlier today, Hakeem Jeffries, AOC, 1400 prominent African-American women, they [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=266.22s)]
*  are now urging Joe Biden to stay in the race. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  There is an internal battle going on in that party. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  All while ignorant DC elitists led by Obama and ignorant fools like far left Hollywood [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=279.3s)]
*  elitists, you know, people like George Clooney have called for Biden to step aside. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, state-run media, the mob, they have now been given the green light to finally [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  start telling the truth. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  We've been doing it for over four years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=298.66s)]
*  We've been doing it before the 2020 election as it relates to Biden's cognitive decline, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  a truth that they have all known about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  They have all covered up for years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  Stories about Joe's mental incompetence are suddenly everywhere, even on MSDNC. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=310.86s)]
*  Now, of course, they're not worried about his cognitive decline. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=315.62s)]
*  They've covered it up all this time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  They're not worried about the horrendous state of the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=321.3s)]
*  They're not worried about our standing in the world. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  These Democratic elites, they only care about the polls, and the polls are very bad for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=326.82s)]
*  Joe Biden, also Kamala, but Joe Biden in particular. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=331.5s)]
*  So what we are really witnessing here is a maximum pressure campaign, all designed to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  humiliate the sitting president of our country so that he will drop out of the race. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=340.92s)]
*  And these are the very same Democratic elites that drape themselves in the virtues of democracy, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  warn that democracy is in peril if Donald Trump wins. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=352.62s)]
*  And now they are trying to literally void millions of Democratic primary votes, and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  they're literally disenfranchising own party members in order to select a more preferred [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=362.62s)]
*  candidate. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  A little bit of a coup, some may call it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, there is but one problem for all of these party elites. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=372.38s)]
*  As of tonight, Joe Biden says he's not going anywhere. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=376.18s)]
*  Apparently, as of now, you can't humiliate a man that has up to this point had no shame. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=379.38s)]
*  Joe Biden was picked by a wide majority of Democratic voters to run for a second term. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=385.3s)]
*  And to his credit, as of now, he's not just going to step aside to appease the desires [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=391.14s)]
*  of Barack Obama, George Clooney, you know, elites in Washington, elites in Hollywood. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=396.32s)]
*  Multiple reports now confirm Biden will in fact absolutely stay in the race, hit the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=401.98s)]
*  campaign trail next week. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=407.0s)]
*  Campaign officials deny reports that Biden is making plans for a quote graceful exit. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=409.38s)]
*  But the drama is not over. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=414.86s)]
*  According to NBC News, top Democrats now plan to take their criticism of Joe Biden public [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=416.66s)]
*  next week if in fact he refuses private calls to step down. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=422.46s)]
*  So next week, when Joe Biden hits the campaign trail, he won't just be campaigning against [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=427.26s)]
*  Donald Trump, but against the elites in his own party, the D.C., Hollywood and Democratic [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=432.46s)]
*  Party donor class. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=438.46s)]
*  So we are exactly one month short until the DNC. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=440.74s)]
*  The Democratic Party is in shambles. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=444.58s)]
*  Joe's nomination is scheduled to happen even sooner. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=446.9s)]
*  That's supposed to happen virtually. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=450.94s)]
*  And to add insult to injury, Biden is now sidelined with COVID-19. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=452.94s)]
*  After his diagnosis, he can barely climb up the short baby stairs to Air Force One. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=457.88s)]
*  He's long given up the big boy stairs. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=463.06s)]
*  Can't walk to Marine One, to or from Marine One without a crowd surrounding him to cover [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=465.54s)]
*  for him. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=470.02s)]
*  And earlier in the week, Biden's cognitive struggles were on full display. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=471.34s)]
*  At one point, he forgot the name of his own secretary of defense, referring to Lloyd Austin [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=474.62s)]
*  Joe as, quote, the black man. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=480.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=484.14s)]
*  It's all about treating people with dignity. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=485.14s)]
*  And it's about making sure that, look, I mean, for example, look at the heat I'm getting [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=488.26s)]
*  because I named the secretary of defense the black man. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=492.5s)]
*  I named Katonji Brown, I mean, because of the people I've named. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=499.06s)]
*  The secretary of defense, you know, the black man. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  This guy hasn't had a cabinet meeting as reports go, what, nine or ten months? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=508.3s)]
*  During a speech at the NAACP convention, Biden struggled to finish sentences, organize his [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=515.02s)]
*  thoughts. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=520.58s)]
*  In other words, a continuation of everything we have been showing you since before the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=521.58s)]
*  2020 election right here on this show for your own eyes to see. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=526.74s)]
*  Never cheap, fake videos. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=532.98s)]
*  The only one with cheap, fake videos are, well, the rest of the media mob. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=534.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=538.66s)]
*  I thought you were saying, Joe, you made it out of Congress. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=539.66s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  You all told me I couldn't pass the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  You all told me I couldn't face it anyway. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=546.62s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=549.62s)]
*  We're going to bring rents down, as I said. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=550.62s)]
*  We're going to build two million affordable homes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=552.62s)]
*  The cap rent increases at 5% a year, so corporate landlords can't gawd anyway. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=554.62s)]
*  I don't want to get going. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=560.62s)]
*  I'm going to get very upset. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=561.62s)]
*  $160 billion because they don't have to pay these exorbitant prices to these... [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=564.26s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=573.26s)]
*  Anyway, it's his way of basically saying, I have no idea what the hell I was about to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=577.26s)]
*  say I forgot, so I'll just move on. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=582.9s)]
*  House Democrats reported similar behavior from the president after a recent Zoom call [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=585.46s)]
*  went totally off the rails. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=590.54s)]
*  Now, according to those on the call, quote, Biden was rambling, dismissive of concerns, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=592.42s)]
*  unable or unprepared to present a campaign strategy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=598.8199999999999s)]
*  One unnamed lawmaker told the Daily Beast, quote, Biden would start an answer, lose his [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=603.06s)]
*  train of thought, and then would say, whatever, or anyway. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=607.9799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, we really couldn't complete an answer. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=612.42s)]
*  I lost a ton of respect for him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=615.78s)]
*  A flat-out lie also from the source. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=617.74s)]
*  They all knew. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=621.74s)]
*  They all knew they all covered it up. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=622.94s)]
*  At one point during a disagreement about foreign policy, Biden started screaming at Congressman [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=625.62s)]
*  Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who served three tours of duty overseas. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=631.0200000000001s)]
*  Biden even reportedly trashed Congressman Crow's Bronze Star. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=636.9000000000001s)]
*  A staffer hands Biden a note telling him, quote, stay positive, you're sounding defensive. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=641.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, how do we know that? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  Because Biden took the note and then he read it out loud, like when he reads in the teleprompter. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=649.46s)]
*  Pause. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=655.7s)]
*  Let me say what I'm going to say. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=656.7s)]
*  I say this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=658.46s)]
*  Pause. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=659.86s)]
*  Biden is obviously in bad shape, has been for many years, mentally and politically. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=660.86s)]
*  And tonight, I don't know exactly how this democratic civil war will end politically, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=667.1s)]
*  but I do know that Biden has always been nothing more than a front man for his party's radical [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=672.94s)]
*  left-wing, Marxist, socialist, New Green Deal policies. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=678.2199999999999s)]
*  So no matter who the Democrats end up nominating, whether it's Joe or Kamala or anybody else, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=682.06s)]
*  that radical agenda, that's going to be the same agenda. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  And that agenda is failing all of you, every American, in every way. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=692.64s)]
*  Everything is now worse under this administration. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=698.66s)]
*  The one thing nobody can run on, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=701.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about Biden inflation, record violent crime, even the Secret Service now [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=705.7800000000001s)]
*  facing a massive and rightly so crisis of confidence. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=710.98s)]
*  The director, Kim Cheadle, refusing to step down, you know, I accept responsibility. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I made the decision to put them inside the building. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=720.98s)]
*  Why not surround the perimeter of the building? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=725.26s)]
*  Why not have sniper eyes on the building? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, there's no slope on that roof. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=730.74s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=734.1s)]
*  The roofer. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=735.14s)]
*  After Saturday's massive security failure, she won't even hold any regular press conference [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=736.14s)]
*  to update the public on the ongoing investigation. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=741.34s)]
*  After there's any school shooting, within hours, we usually know a lot about the shooter. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=745.02s)]
*  The head of the DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of the DOJ, Merrick Garland, the head [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=750.34s)]
*  of the FBI, Director Wray, are noticeably all missing in action. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=756.3000000000001s)]
*  This was the biggest security failure in 50 years and no one in the Biden administration [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=761.58s)]
*  even seems concerned. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  Democrats, their silence has been deafening for at least an hour before the shooting. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=768.46s)]
*  We now know the would-be assassin was being tracked as a suspicious person by the Secret [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=773.7s)]
*  Service. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=779.98s)]
*  Why did he have a rangefinder? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=780.98s)]
*  Who brings a rangefinder? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=782.62s)]
*  Just happens to have it with them. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  And this was after he showed up at that checkpoint. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=786.1s)]
*  They saw that he had it and then they lost track of him, but they still let President [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=789.38s)]
*  Trump take to the stage. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=793.3s)]
*  Now this guy was captured on video, as you can see there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=795.82s)]
*  He was walking around outside the Trump rally, plotting his attack. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=798.58s)]
*  He had a ladder and he had a rifle. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=802.42s)]
*  That would be suspicious, no? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=805.34s)]
*  And yet he was ultimately able to climb onto that roof with that ladder in plain sight, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=807.38s)]
*  only 130 yards from Donald Trump. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=812.34s)]
*  Cheadle claiming that her agents were not stationed on the roof because of the slight [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=815.5400000000001s)]
*  slope. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, a Secret Service sniper team was positioned on a nearby roof, as you can see [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  there, with an even steeper slope. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=825.62s)]
*  But it gets worse. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  For what seemed like an eternity, Trump supporters, they spotted the shooter on that roof. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=829.7800000000001s)]
*  They called out to law enforcement to stop him. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  And yet this amateur assassin was able to set up his long rifle and fire off multiple [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=838.58s)]
*  rounds before a Secret Service sniper returned fire. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=843.7s)]
*  How can this happen? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=848.0200000000001s)]
*  Who will take responsibility? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=850.0200000000001s)]
*  By the way, is anyone else involved? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=852.38s)]
*  Do we know anything about this? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=854.14s)]
*  And will anyone in the Biden administration be held accountable for anything ever? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  Make no mistake, Biden should be his party's nominee. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=861.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=864.38s)]
*  He was elected by the millions of primary voters during that process. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=865.38s)]
*  But let's be clear, Joe and his fellow Democrats should not be anywhere near the halls of government. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=870.02s)]
*  They have failed all of you from day one. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=876.18s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=879.46s)]
*  And if Biden somehow manages to get reelected, you're just going to see more of the same. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=881.5799999999999s)]
*  And all of you will suffer more. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=887.46s)]
*  And our country will suffer more. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=889.54s)]
*  And the world, because he's abdicated, America's role as the leader of the free world, we are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uE8x3nIEQ&t=891.62s)]
