# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris is a liar
**Fox News:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA)
*  But first, we do have a message for Donald Trump's opponent tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, earlier, Kamala Harris, well, she's not campaigning in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=3.6s)]
*  Michigan, Georgia or any other battleground state. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=9.0s)]
*  Instead, she is spending time in a place near and dear to her heart, a city filled of lobbyists, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=12.36s)]
*  government workers, bureaucrats, politicians, far-left fake news journalists, a city that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=18.72s)]
*  Biden carried by more than 92 percent of the vote, a city where Kamala feels right at home. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  And of course, we are talking about the Washington swamp. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=31.4s)]
*  And just moments ago, the anointed Democratic candidate made her so-called closing argument [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=34.36s)]
*  at a rally near the White House. And just a few metro stops away, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=40.44s)]
*  oh, violent crime is raging through Washington, D.C. It is one of the most dangerous cities in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=44.44s)]
*  America, but Kamala didn't talk about crime in tonight's speech. The nation's capital is also [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=49.96s)]
*  struggling with rising homelessness and a record high cost of living. Kamala didn't say much about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=55.72s)]
*  inflation or the housing crisis she didn't deal with for four years. Meanwhile, Washington, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=62.12s)]
*  D.C. is also suffering from a massive influx of Harris-Biden unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=67.32s)]
*  But according to Kamala, this is Donald Trump's fault, of course. Take a look. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=73.32s)]
*  I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=78.36s)]
*  that Donald Trump killed. Kamala told a lot of lies tonight, and that was the amnesty bill [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=84.12s)]
*  that would allow millions of illegal immigrants into the country every single year. That was not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  a border security bill by any stretch of the imagination. And that wasn't the only lie from [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=97.48s)]
*  tonight's speech. So let's expose these smears one by one. Here's Kamala lying about abortion, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=102.44s)]
*  birth control and IVF. Take a look. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=108.36s)]
*  That's like a triple lie in one paragraph. Here's a headline from CBS. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=131.64s)]
*  And by the way, does not call for restrictions on birth control, the opposite of what Harris [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  claimed tonight. He is also totally opposed to limiting any of this in any way, has called on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  the federal government to help fund IVF, as a matter of fact. And by the way, it is not Trump's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=152.44000000000003s)]
*  Project 2025. He's not affiliated with it in any way, knows nothing about it, has never even [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=158.12s)]
*  read the so-called project. Kamala Harris is a liar, and her next lie was about social security [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=163.24s)]
*  and Medicare. Let's scare the old people as per usual. Take a look. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=169.88s)]
*  Okay, here's the truth. Donald Trump says he will, quote, never do anything to cut [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=183.4s)]
*  In fact, benefits went up under Donald Trump in his first term. She's lying again. She also [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=188.92s)]
*  blatantly lied when she mentioned unity and bringing the country together. In reality, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=194.6s)]
*  she and her surrogates are spending almost all their time, all their energy smearing, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=200.12s)]
*  slandering her political rivals and playing political games. In fact, just seconds before [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=204.52s)]
*  promising to bring the country together, here's what she had to say about her political opponent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=209.96s)]
*  Wow, this is really unity, if I've ever heard it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=214.84s)]
*  That was like 10 lies in one paragraph amid all the smears and the slander and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=244.84s)]
*  besmirchment and lying. This was a robotic, uninspiring, meaningless speech. She claims she [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  will represent all Americans, even those who don't vote for her. Days after she and her acolytes were [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  out there calling everyone supporting Donald Trump a Nazi and a fascist. She promised to always [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=268.52s)]
*  tell the truth, even when it's difficult, but she lied over and over again, didn't she, about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  inflation being transitory, the border being secure, about how comfortable she was with the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Afghanistan withdrawal and about Joe Biden's cognitive state. She says she will never denigrate [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=285.24s)]
*  or dishonor those in the military. She called the Afghan withdrawal a success and when she is at, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=291.32s)]
*  if she would have done anything differently or had any regrets from Joe Biden, she couldn't, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=297.56s)]
*  you know, she could not say that she regretted any decision, including the decision to allow [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=303.24s)]
*  our enemies to take over the security outside that air base in Afghanistan. Her inability to admit to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=308.44s)]
*  her mistakes and failures that led to deaths and it dishonors the service of so many. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=315.32s)]
*  What we are witnessing is a failing campaign and an attempt to try and regain the post-DNC bump [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=323.64s)]
*  a week before the election as they see more and more states falling out of reach. The desperation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=330.52s)]
*  and panic is palpable. Still, this election, I always warn everybody, assume that your vote [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=336.36s)]
*  will decide the outcome of this election. And it's very close on paper, but the Harris campaign is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  clearly running scared. Today, we did learn that the campaign is now pulling millions of dollars [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=349.08s)]
*  in ad spending from North Carolina amid a, quote, surge of Republican early voters. There has been a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=354.12s)]
*  similar surge across all the battleground states and Trump is also outperforming expectations in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  national polling. And according to the most accurate pollster of 2020, Atlas Intel, Donald Trump is now [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=366.36s)]
*  up by nearly two points. Now, the same poll shows Trump ahead in all but one battleground state [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=373.0s)]
*  and again, this will all mean nothing if you don't bank your vote. I voted Sunday, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=378.84s)]
*  but you can still take joy in knowing that these polls are causing epic meltdowns on the left. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. Here's the warning. You all have set it up, but let me take it a step further, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=389.64s)]
*  please, if I may. This is called normalization. Yes. This is the descent into fascism, if we so [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  choose. They think, okay, we've already seen that movie. I can live with it for four more years, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=404.44s)]
*  but it's not the same movie. You know, it's the sequel to Scream where it's just that much [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=409.24s)]
*  bloodier. And, you know, there are people, I mean, you're journalists, you and I might be sharing a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=414.76s)]
*  cell in, you know, six months from now. The stakes literally are life and death for every woman in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=419.08s)]
*  America. And he wants to start internment camps. And that's what we are busy talking to every voter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=424.68s)]
*  He's telling you what he's going to do. Believe him. Internment camps? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=430.12s)]
*  Yes. He has talked to internment camps. You know what, Jake? You may have to visit me on one. I [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=435.08s)]
*  get worried enough when he talks about what he's going to do to his political enemies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=439.64s)]
*  And it gets worse. Remember, irredeemable deplorables and bitter Americans clinging [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=445.16s)]
*  to their God guns, Bibles, religion from Obama. Yeah. Well, now President Biden, well, he couldn't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=449.64s)]
*  stay out of the fray. He referred to Donald Trump supporters as, quote, garbage watch. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=455.88s)]
*  Puerto Rico, where I'm in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=463.48s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=469.0s)]
*  Coming back. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  Only garbage I see out there, just Trump supporters. Now remember, according to Kamala, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  it's Donald, who he's the one that's flaming, fanning the flames of division. Take a look. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=477.88s)]
*  I talked with Governor Walz yesterday. He compared Trump's rally on Sunday to that of one of the Nazi [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=483.0s)]
*  rallies in the Ferris at Madison Square Garden. Do you compare that? Do you find that a similar [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=490.36s)]
*  comparison? Listen, this election is in seven days, and I think the American people have a very [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=495.16s)]
*  clear choice. And on the one hand, you have Donald Trump, who is constantly fanning the flames of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=501.0s)]
*  division and hate, who is trying to have the American people point their fingers at each other, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=507.88s)]
*  or my leadership, which is founded on a lived and experience that the vast majority of us [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=514.28s)]
*  have more in common than what separate us. Yeah, let's double down on Nazi, Nazi, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=523.64s)]
*  racist, racist, fascist, fascist. It might be the clearest example of gaslighting and hypocrisy that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=529.16s)]
*  we'll ever see. At the end of the day, only one question really matters. Are you better off than [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=535.08s)]
*  you were under Donald Trump? And so tonight, while Kamala's spending time with her friends in the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=540.12s)]
*  Washington swamp, the former president, oh, look right there. He's in Allentown, Pennsylvania, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=545.0s)]
*  in front of another massive crowd. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZq-rm9sYA&t=550.9200000000001s)]
