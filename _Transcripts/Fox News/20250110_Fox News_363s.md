# Hannity: Trump eviscerated the left’s lawfare campaign
**Fox News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw)
*  But we begin with good news tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Against all odds, after years of sketchy warrants, subpoenas, early morning raids, dozens of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  cooked up charges, one after another, far-left judges and Trump-hating juries, Donald Trump [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=9.64s)]
*  has eviscerated the left's lawfare campaign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=16.8s)]
*  Today, New York judge, Democratic donor Juan Marchand, announced that Trump would receive [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=20.36s)]
*  no fine, no probation after a Manhattan jury convicted Trump on what is a novel, bizarre [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=26.28s)]
*  legal theory surrounding a case that had no victims. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=32.88s)]
*  I mean, it was a legal NDA put together by a lawyer and it was chronicled as a legal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=36.04s)]
*  expense. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Judge Marchand told Trump, sir, I wish you Godspeed as you assume your second term in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=43.0s)]
*  office. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=48.16s)]
*  It was almost laughable. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=49.16s)]
*  Despite no penalty at all, Donald Trump will rightly appeal this bogus conviction. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=50.32s)]
*  At his sentencing, the president-elect blasting the left their attempts to weaponize our system [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=55.88s)]
*  of justice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=61.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=62.28s)]
*  This has been a very terrible experience. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=63.92s)]
*  I think it's been a tremendous setback for New York and the New York court system. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=66.84s)]
*  This is a case that Alvin Bragg did not want to bring. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=72.32s)]
*  He thought it was, from what I read and from what I hear, inappropriately handled before [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  he got there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=85.92s)]
*  A gentleman from a law firm came in and acted as a district attorney. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=87.92s)]
*  And that gentleman, from what I heard, was a criminal or almost criminal in what he did. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  It was very inappropriate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=101.44s)]
*  It was somebody involved with my political opponent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=103.12s)]
*  I think about legal expenses are down as legal expenses. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And I get indicted for business records. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=111.4s)]
*  Everybody should be so accurate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=113.84s)]
*  It's been a political witch hunt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=116.84s)]
*  It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  And obviously that didn't work. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  And the people of our country got to see this firsthand because they watched the case in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=125.2s)]
*  your courtroom. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=129.08s)]
*  They got to see this firsthand and then they voted and I won and got the largest number [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=130.38s)]
*  of votes by far of any Republican candidate in history. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=135.0s)]
*  And one, as you know, all seven swing states, one conclusively all seven swing states and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=140.04s)]
*  one the popularity, the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=147.6s)]
*  And they've been watching your trial. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  So they understood it with all that's happening in our country today with a city that's burning [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=155.04s)]
*  to the ground, one of our largest, most important cities burning to the ground with with wars [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=160.52s)]
*  that are uncontrollably going on with all of the problems of inflation and attacks on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  countries and all of the horrible things that are going on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=173.96s)]
*  I got indicted over calling a legal expense a legal expense. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=177.4s)]
*  And the people of this country understand what's going on. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=181.56s)]
*  This has been a weaponization of government. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=184.12s)]
*  They call it lawfare. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=186.22s)]
*  Never happened to any extent like this, but never happened in our country before. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=187.92s)]
*  And I just like to explain that I was treated very, very unfairly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=193.0s)]
*  And I thank you very much. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=198.64s)]
*  Trump hating Democrats. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  They tried to throw the former president in prison. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  They wanted to send him to Rikers Island. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=204.64s)]
*  They wanted to ruin his life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=206.6s)]
*  They did try to destroy his reputation, all in order to block him from winning an election. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  This is a massive scandal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest in modern American history and the media, they're perfectly fine with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=217.72s)]
*  it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=222.16s)]
*  These Democrats utterly failed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=223.16s)]
*  And now it's time for reckoning at the DOJ, the FBI and the clown shows that are going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=224.84s)]
*  on in Atlanta and New York. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=230.68s)]
*  Now, I don't mean that Republicans should follow suit. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=232.52s)]
*  No, they should end the weaponization of justice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=236.32s)]
*  They should adhere to equal justice and application of our laws, return to constitutional order. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=239.32s)]
*  They shouldn't do to them and they're scared to death that that would happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=245.6s)]
*  That which was done to Donald Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=249.84s)]
*  The left tried to turn our courts, the FBI, our intelligence community into a Soviet style [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=251.78s)]
*  political enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=257.92s)]
*  Thankfully that'll end in what? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=261.2s)]
*  12 days, whatever it is on January 20th. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=263.64s)]
*  If you are a Democrat and you're watching tonight, pay close attention. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=266.7s)]
*  In this country, crimes get prosecuted, not people in this country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=271.36s)]
*  Justice is supposed to be blind. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=276.78s)]
*  We're supposed to have equal justice under the law without political bias. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=279.12s)]
*  Far left bureaucrats that live in DC do not get to anoint our leaders and make our laws. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=285.04s)]
*  And American presidents are supposed to lead and not take orders in between their naps [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=290.96s)]
*  from a group of unelected, overeducated socialists that have an agenda. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=296.92s)]
*  This is a Democratic Republic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=302.56s)]
*  It must remain one. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=304.8s)]
*  It's supposed to be by, of, and for the people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=306.12s)]
*  And our rights are enshrined by a creator. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  Not the thing, Joe. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=312.42s)]
*  Anyway, the left tried to criminalize Donald Trump's free expression in the whole process, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  block his right to participate in our elections. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=318.44s)]
*  And in the process, they ended up putting Donald Trump and his supporters through hell. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  This can never happen again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=326.8s)]
*  The pompous far left bureaucrats, long entrenched in that Washington swamp, when Donald Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  gets in, I hope he fires them all, flushes them all out so that freedom, equal justice, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=334.84s)]
*  the rule of law, constitutional order will be restored. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=341.28s)]
*  In just what, 10 days, this important work will officially begin and not a moment too soon. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=345.48s)]
*  For interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOhlXnzrTTw&t=356.76s)]
