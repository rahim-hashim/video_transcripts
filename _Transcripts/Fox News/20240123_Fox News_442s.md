# Dana Perino: Trump needs some of these people to win the general election
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U)
*  All right, joining us now, President Trump speaking tonight at a unity rally here in New Hampshire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=0.0s)]
*  I will dip back in in a few minutes joining us now on set Fox News contributor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  Charlie hurt the co-host of two hit shows the five and America's newsroom and I will be her guest tomorrow [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=9.3s)]
*  Which is a great honor of mine. I'm got the countdown clock. What do you make of where we are now? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  It's interesting because you know, we were here in this very place in 2016 and 2020 and in 2016 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=22.8s)]
*  When we came here there were still I think eight candidates left and it was at the New Hampshire debate where you had what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=30.0s)]
*  Was called the murder-suicide of Marco Rubio between it strategized between Trump and Chris Christie [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=35.28s)]
*  And just to think of how much history is behind us in those eight years very tumultuous to get to a point where you are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=41.54s)]
*  In a two-person race Nikki Haley has said all along that that's what she wanted and she did help winnow the field, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  She is still in it. She's here for tomorrow in New Hampshire [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=54.6s)]
*  The polls are not great for her and I don't know if she got to the two-person race too late [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=57.76s)]
*  But you see what Donald Trump they're bringing in Doug Burgum and Vivek Ramaswamy Tim Scott all [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=63.8s)]
*  Previous opponents of his in this primary and they're all for him screaming four more years and Tim Scott is from South Carolina [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=69.16s)]
*  Which would be up next at well at Nevada in South Carolina [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=74.8s)]
*  What do you make of this Charlie? Well, certainly Nikki Haley got what she wanted as you say [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=78.64s)]
*  But now what you want exactly now it's gonna she's gonna get her one-on-one race I [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=85.0s)]
*  Still think that you know, it's it's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm a little cautious just because when you're looking at 40% of the pipe of the voting population here who is independent and they have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=93.92s)]
*  the choice tomorrow of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=101.68s)]
*  going in and writing in Joe Biden's name or playing in the Republican primary and trying to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Hurt Trump and help Nikki Haley, I think you know, it's it's too soon to say for certain [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=110.48s)]
*  But if Donald Trump wins by, you know 40 points or wins by two points [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=116.68s)]
*  it's the difference between it's a slow death or a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=122.64s)]
*  Fast death. It's it's I don't see the trajectory is not gonna change [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=126.6s)]
*  Well the number of people that switched that was I think the Secretary of State's office said about four thousand thousand. Yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=131.32s)]
*  And that ended in October, however, you do have this large number of independents [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=137.16s)]
*  They can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary or not vote at all [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  And there have been efforts organized efforts to get people to vote for Nikki Haley to extend out [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=146.16s)]
*  What they think will be it will force Donald Trump to spend more money [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=152.16s)]
*  Extend the the primary as long as possible. Therefore that benefits them in the long run. It's an interesting strategy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=156.44s)]
*  I don't think it'll really work and Nikki Haley has rejected that saying [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=162.44s)]
*  I'm not trying to do that if people want to vote for me, she's never gonna turn them away. That's what she says [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=165.16s)]
*  But I also think it's interesting. There's 40% independent here in Nevada and New Hampshire. Excuse me. We have not in Nevada yet [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=169.32s)]
*  But in the country, did you see the recent Gallup poll? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=176.28s)]
*  43% of the country says that they are independent. So the both parties are the largest number ever, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=179.48s)]
*  It's a large summer. So both parties are shrinking and so I'm really interested going forward [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=185.44s)]
*  Let's say that President Trump slows up the nomination [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=189.64s)]
*  How did you go back to an Obama Trump Biden voter and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=191.88s)]
*  Say give me another shot that will be interesting messaging and you will need to get some of those people if he's going to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=199.44s)]
*  Win the general James Carville said and I pay attention when James speaks [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=205.94s)]
*  I've had a number of debate with debates with him over the years fun guy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=210.2s)]
*  Crazy, but fun but smart also very and one of the things he said is a third party [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=215.0s)]
*  Independent run this year is gonna get a hell of a lot of votes and I think he's right [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  But I also don't think that that's gonna hurt Donald Trump. I think that that hurts Joe Biden and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=226.0s)]
*  If it's no labels if it's RFK [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=231.64s)]
*  I think and even if it's a never Trump or type person who wants to run and think that they're gonna be a spoiler [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=234.16s)]
*  For Donald Trump, I don't think it's gonna work. What about Joe Manchin and Tulsi Gabbard? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=241.72s)]
*  I think I think it hurt. I think it all hurts Joe Biden [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that you know any alternative [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=249.28s)]
*  Donald as you know Sean [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=252.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's supporters are not like wavering and the one thing that was absolutely [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=255.0s)]
*  Declared in Iowa and is true in all of these polls is you know, the question for me was have Republicans grown exhausted [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=260.36s)]
*  And do they want to move on? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=268.04s)]
*  They don't want to move on they want to stay and they want to fight and they want to fight with this guy and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=269.68s)]
*  And to me, you know DeSantis's decision to get out and his comments [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=275.0s)]
*  I thought were so interesting to me [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=278.6s)]
*  That was the most interesting part was the part where he his analysis that look I did my best [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=280.04s)]
*  People want to stick with the guy that brought him this far and they want to fight and I think it's true [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=285.4s)]
*  I like to national review [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=290.2s)]
*  There was a headline by Philip Klein that said that DeSantis was like peloton in a post-covid world [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=291.36s)]
*  You don't actually need you yet right now. Actually, we're pretty good with what we had before so that's that's a pretty good analogy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=297.68s)]
*  All right, who would be the people in four years from now when we're here God willing again four years from now [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=303.8s)]
*  Well, I thought it was very interesting that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=310.32s)]
*  Behind the scenes what DeSantis was saying and his people were saying is that as he went around meeting voters [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=312.4s)]
*  They might say to him you're our guy in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=318.88s)]
*  2028 if Trump weren't running we'd be with you, but we're gonna stick with him [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=322.32s)]
*  You don't disagree. He is a young leading conservative [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=327.12s)]
*  America first voice in the country [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  100% and he's an extremely competent executive agree, but he's not a great campaigner [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=334.56s)]
*  And can you can he become a great campaigner or is that instinctual? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  That's an interesting question. I mean I was not that critical of his campaign as others have been [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  I'll tell you I learned a lot about him the night. He debated Newsom. Oh, yeah [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  I bet because he came in prepared and he did nothing fazed him [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=354.24s)]
*  You know Gavin came in with you know, every pre-prepared line ready to you know to fire out every bullet [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  He had in his political gun. He's brilliant as running as an incumbent as we saw in 2022 [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  He had accomplishments to run on and people loved him [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=370.24s)]
*  He beat Charlie Chris by by over 20 points in a swing state of Florida [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  Which is no longer a swing state and so to me the question is does he end up running in? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=379.12s)]
*  2028 sort of as an incumbent and the way only way I see that is if Donald Trump decides to pick him as vice president [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=384.76s)]
*  And I know it seemed everything seems kind of acrimonious right now, but I don't think it's out of the question [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=390.92s)]
*  I think that you know if Donald Trump decides that that Rhonda Santa says he would be anointing him his successor [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=395.36s)]
*  exactly because as Dana before we came on the air rightly pointed out if [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  Somebody the day after election day, whoever that vice president is they're probably gonna have an eye on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=407.8s)]
*  That desk that Donald Trump has with a red button. That's not for nuclear weapons, but for diet coke [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=414.4s)]
*  That's right. That's what is and they better have a better political operation than Kamala Harris. Well said that's true [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=420.0s)]
*  Great to see I'll see you on your show [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i7ZNTKI5U&t=426.04s)]
