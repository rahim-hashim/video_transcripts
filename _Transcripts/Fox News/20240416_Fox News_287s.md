# Newt Gingrich: Biden is beyond being a 'paper tiger'
**Fox News:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ)
*  former speaker of the house, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=0.0s)]
*  To me, this might be the lowest point of what has been a failed presidency, and that is [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=2.24s)]
*  a lack of moral clarity and abandoning our allies and literally in many ways giving, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=8.2s)]
*  you know, the thumbs up that you're not going to be punished if in fact you are involved [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=15.6s)]
*  in either proxy terror wars or direct terror wars. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=20.7s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=24.6s)]
*  Well, you know, if you actually look at what Biden does, it's pretty straightforward. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  He abandons our allies in Afghanistan after being warned by the military that if you pull [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=34.28s)]
*  out they're going to collapse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=41.84s)]
*  It didn't matter. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  He abandoned them after 22 years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  He's told the Ukrainians, you're not allowed to fight Russia in Russia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=48.8s)]
*  They can bomb you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=54.32s)]
*  They can destroy your electric facilities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=55.68s)]
*  They can destroy your towns. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=57.88s)]
*  You're not allowed to use any weapon to go inside Russia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  And he said to the Israelis, I think that Rafa ought to become a terrorist sanctuary [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=62.52s)]
*  city, a moment of total insanity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=69.0s)]
*  We have allowed an Iranian warship to sit in the Red Sea, where it helped Houthis target [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=73.76s)]
*  their missiles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=82.4s)]
*  That ship could be sunk by the American Navy in five minutes, but it sits there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=83.58s)]
*  And now you've had 335 missiles and various other weapons fired at Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=89.1s)]
*  I did a piece at Gingrich 360 where I said, look, if you say don't and 335 times they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=96.14s)]
*  do, then what's your obligation to respond? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=105.1s)]
*  Biden is beyond being a paper tiger. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=108.86s)]
*  This is pathetic, but I think it's deliberate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=111.78s)]
*  I think he's a classic left-wing liberal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=114.98s)]
*  When in doubt, America and its allies are bad, and the enemy is actually good. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=118.1s)]
*  And so you ought to understand the enemy, no matter how bad the enemy is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=123.64s)]
*  And that's where we're at. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=127.78s)]
*  And until we defeat him, that's where we're going to continue to be at, because that's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=129.1s)]
*  who he really is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=133.14s)]
*  So we've got to ask the question, and you have touched on it, and that is the why. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=135.46s)]
*  OK, I think Biden is watching polls. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=140.38s)]
*  His base is eroding. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=144.34s)]
*  That would be the traditional base of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=145.8s)]
*  His numbers are crashing with African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=148.82s)]
*  youth voters going away. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=155.54s)]
*  And he's got all these radicals in his party in Michigan and other places, and he sees [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=157.58s)]
*  these numbers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=163.02s)]
*  They would rather vote for uncommitted, nearly 20 percent of Democratic primary voters in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=164.02s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=168.58s)]
*  And he cares more about his blind political ambition than he does about standing up against [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=170.0s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=175.55999999999997s)]
*  That's a U.S. president? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=176.56s)]
*  No, I don'tâ€” [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=178.92s)]
*  That's the leader of the free world? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=179.92s)]
*  No, look, I actually don't agree with you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't think this is purely transactional and purely political. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  Way back in 1984, Ambassador Jane Kirkpatrick made an amazing speech at the Republican National [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=188.32s)]
*  Convention in which she described the blame America first Democrats and said, whatever [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=194.4s)]
*  happens anywhere in the world, the reaction of the American left is blame America first. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=207.0s)]
*  That was Joe Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=208.28s)]
*  He was in the Senate already. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=210.24s)]
*  He was part of that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=212.08s)]
*  Now he's surrounded by people who are crazy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=214.24s)]
*  And the fact is, I think we ought to go back and learn the lessons of the 1930s. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was faced with a Nazi effort inside the United States. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=222.4s)]
*  They locked people up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=227.8s)]
*  I believe, frankly, we should say, if you are for the victory of Iran, if you want to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  scream, death to America, we're deporting you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=233.9s)]
*  If you're an American, we're going to try you for treason. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=238.36s)]
*  You can't get up and say, death to America, as an American citizen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=240.8s)]
*  And it's time that we were prepared to defend the survival of the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=244.4s)]
*  And I think it's time we confronted head on a president who clearly, on every single [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=250.22s)]
*  front, from Ukraine, where he favors Russia, to what's happened in Afghanistan, where [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=255.58s)]
*  in the end he favored the Taliban, to what's happening in Gaza, where he favors Hamas, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=261.82s)]
*  to what's happening with Iran, where he favors the Iranians. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=267.82s)]
*  On every front, Joe Biden is on the side of the people who hate America. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=270.9s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=280.38s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJSp9kGenQ&t=283.98s)]
