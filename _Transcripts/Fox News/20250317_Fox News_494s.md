# Karoline Leavitt: This has gotten totally out of control
**Fox News:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ)
*  All right, it's time now for the Hannity, Washington briefing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And there's only one person available for that, and that is White House press secretary, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=4.04s)]
*  our friend Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=7.24s)]
*  Let's talk about the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=8.44s)]
*  It has been used multiple times by multiple presidents, and it is very, very crystal clear. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=10.68s)]
*  Any invasion, predatory incursion, shall be perpetrated, attempted or threatened against [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  the territory of the U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  By any foreign nation government, the president shall make a public proclamation of the event, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=23.32s)]
*  and these people shall be removed from this country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  It's not really that difficult to comprehend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  However, Democrats are using the courts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=34.32s)]
*  This is now the, what, 50th time that Democrats have gone to the courts, 15 times they've [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=37.44s)]
*  been successful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=41.76s)]
*  I do believe it will be overturned. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=42.76s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=44.28s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept, Sean. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=47.68s)]
*  President Trump campaigned on securing our homeland, on expelling foreign terrorists [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=50.0s)]
*  and illegal violent criminals from our nation's interior, and that is exactly what he is doing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=55.58s)]
*  On February 20th, President Trump signed an executive order designating Tren de Aragua [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=62.58s)]
*  as a foreign terrorist organization, because that is what they are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=68.74s)]
*  As you just heard Sarah so eloquently say, these are some of the most heinous monsters, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=73.02s)]
*  criminal gangsters, violent murderers and rapists who have invaded our country under [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=78.5s)]
*  the lawlessness of the previous administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=84.04s)]
*  There is a new sheriff in town now, and he is using every lever of executive authority [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  to secure our country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=92.12s)]
*  That's why the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  He is well within his constitutional and legal and executive authority to do so, and our [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  administration is prepared to fight this battle in court because we know that this was a whole [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=102.68s)]
*  of government effort. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  This was a successful counter-terrorism operation led by President Trump, the Department of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=109.76s)]
*  State, the Department of Homeland Security and now the Department of Justice, who will [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=116.0s)]
*  win this battle in court on behalf of the American people and the innocent, beautiful [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  women who were slaughtered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=125.44s)]
*  Their lives were taken too short at the hands of these illegal foreign terrorists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=127.28s)]
*  And if the Democrats want to pick this fight, Sean, it's one we will pick all day long, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  because they are now arguing that the president should have turned around those planes with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=137.04s)]
*  these foreign terrorists on them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=141.16s)]
*  I don't think the American public want these people in our country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=143.0s)]
*  That's why they overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=146.64s)]
*  He is doing the will of the American public who elected him to this office, and thank [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=149.26s)]
*  God he is, because he is saving countless lives in the process. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Carolyn, four different presidents have used this act, the Alien Enemies Act, prior to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=158.12s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=163.28s)]
*  There was a Supreme Court decision in 1948, and the court stated a president's decision [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=165.12s)]
*  under the act precludes judicial review of the removal order. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=170.72s)]
*  They don't even have a say in the courts on this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that's going to be overturned. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=177.8s)]
*  We feel very confident. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=182.0s)]
*  We know we are going to win this battle in court, because again, the president is acting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=183.28s)]
*  within his executive authority as the commander-in-chief of our country, as the Alien Enemies Act clearly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  states. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=194.4s)]
*  And so we have, unfortunately, Sean, a judicial branch that has gotten so out of control. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=195.4s)]
*  You have single judges in single cities, in lower courts, trying to determine the way [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  in which the president handles foreign relations. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=207.74s)]
*  They cannot be allowed to do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=210.94s)]
*  If we live in a country where the will of the American people is subverted by a single [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  judge in a single court, we no longer live in a democracy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=218.12s)]
*  And so this president and this administration are fighting for our constitution and for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=222.76s)]
*  our democracy and fighting for the will of the American people to be done and for foreign [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=227.2s)]
*  terrorists to be expelled from American soil to make the communities of law-abiding citizens [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=232.32s)]
*  safer every single day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=238.6s)]
*  Let's talk about the attack this weekend. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=240.4s)]
*  NBC News reporting the U.S. killed 53 combatants. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=243.32s)]
*  We're talking about the Houthis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=246.56s)]
*  And more importantly, the president also threatens Iran directly, and the consequences will [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=248.88s)]
*  be dire. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=256.12s)]
*  Those were his words if they continue to foment terror in the region. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=257.12s)]
*  I would imagine that—and the president warned Hamas if they did not return all the hostages [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=261.48s)]
*  that the hostilities would begin. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=266.48s)]
*  Israel is currently bombing Gaza as we speak. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=269.04s)]
*  Is this the beginning now of the president fulfilling that promise? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=272.08s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=277.64s)]
*  attacks in Gaza tonight. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=284.88s)]
*  And as President Trump has made it clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=287.0s)]
*  to terrorize not just Israel but also the United States of America will see a price [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  to pay. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=299.28s)]
*  All hell will break loose. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=300.28s)]
*  And all of the terrorists in the Middle East—again, the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iranian-backed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  terror proxies, and Iran themselves—should take President Trump very seriously when he [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  says he is not afraid to stand for law-abiding people, he is not afraid to stand up for the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=313.16s)]
*  United States of America and our friend and our ally Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=319.36s)]
*  And we know that these successful defensive strikes that took place over the weekend against [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=323.74s)]
*  the Houthis in the Red Sea were indeed successful. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=329.8s)]
*  We took out some of their leaders, and the Defense Department is set to continue with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=333.0s)]
*  this campaign if the Houthis continue with their retaliatory measures. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=340.2s)]
*  The president is going to stand for the freedom of navigation of our seas, which is a very [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=344.24s)]
*  basic principle that unfortunately the previous administration refused to stand for, and that's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=349.36s)]
*  why we are in this mess in the Middle East in the first place. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=354.8s)]
*  President Trump inherited a lot of problems, Sean, because of the incompetence and the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=358.32s)]
*  weakness of the Biden-Harris administration, but he is focused on fixing them, and our [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=361.8s)]
*  allies and our adversaries better take him seriously. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=366.44s)]
*  Caroline, let me ask you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=369.44s)]
*  Under President Trump's sanctions and policies, the Iranians were headed towards bankruptcy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=371.04s)]
*  Joe Biden turned a blind eye towards those sanctions. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  The Iranians got rich, and as a result, they were fomenting terror. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=379.6s)]
*  Hamas is Bala, the Islamic Jihad, the Houthi rebels, and they're firing ballistic missiles [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=385.04s)]
*  themselves into Israel. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=390.0s)]
*  It seems to me that under the president's new policy that it seems very clear that they're [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=392.16s)]
*  not going to be able to foment terror anymore, and they're really—and with the IAEA report [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  suggesting that the Iranians are much closer to nuclear weapons than the world thought, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  that would mean that between Israel and the U.S., that those nuclear sites that we understand [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=408.12s)]
*  are buried deep underground will have to go, and probably the refineries that fund their [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=413.6s)]
*  terror will have to go as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Is that the direction the Iranians seem to want? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=419.2s)]
*  Well, we'll have to see, but I would like to talk about the drastic change in policy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=421.8s)]
*  from Trump 1.0 to the Biden administration. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  President Trump had his foot on the neck of the Iranian regime. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=432.62s)]
*  They were weak. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=435.72s)]
*  They were broke. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=436.72s)]
*  The Biden administration lifted President Trump's very effective sanctions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=437.72s)]
*  The Iranian-backed regime was rich. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=442.52s)]
*  They were strong, and their proxies in the Middle East were stronger as a result. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  The Biden administration also lifted the foreign terrorist designation on the Houthis, which, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=448.88s)]
*  as we know, led to those attacks on U.S. naval ships and commercial vessels as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=454.2s)]
*  Now President Trump is back, and he is not going to tolerate this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  He has made it very clear Iran must not have nuclear capability, and they must not support [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=463.24s)]
*  their terrorist proxies in the Middle East. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=468.56s)]
*  If they do that, there will be all hell to pay. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16_pLBHyNQ&t=471.22s)]
