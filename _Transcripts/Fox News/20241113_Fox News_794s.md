# Hannity: Trump has a 'mandate'
**Fox News:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we are at the end of another huge day for the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=5.92s)]
*  The brand new Department of Government Efficiency is in full gear with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=11.72s)]
*  leading the way. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=18.2s)]
*  Coming up, Vivek will join us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=19.2s)]
*  He will be here for an exclusive interview. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=21.18s)]
*  Also, House Speaker Mike Johnson will be here after a big endorsement from President Trump [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=23.6s)]
*  and unanimous support from House Republicans who just re-nominated him as Speaker. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=29.36s)]
*  We're also going to show you the President-elect's triumphant return to the White House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=34.64s)]
*  But first, more huge nominations are now rocking the Washington swamp, breaking only moments [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=40.24s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=45.56s)]
*  We learned that Florida Senator, Vice Senator Marco Rubio has officially been picked for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=46.56s)]
*  Secretary of State. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=51.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, former Democratic Congresswoman turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard was nominated [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  as the Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=57.92s)]
*  And the third pick of the day is causing a bit of, let's call, collective radical left-wing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=60.44s)]
*  meltdown among elites in Washington. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=65.5s)]
*  On Truth Social, President Trump announced that Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz has been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=68.52s)]
*  tapped to serve as the next U.S. Attorney General, the head of the DOJ. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=73.48s)]
*  Now Matt Gaetz is a lawyer, four-term congressman, longtime ally of Donald Trump, who aggressively [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=79.6s)]
*  helped expose political weaponization at the DOJ of Harris and Biden. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=84.94s)]
*  So naturally, the pearl-clutching, breathless hysteria on the left has been nonstop. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=90.42s)]
*  It gotten bad. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=96.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=97.46s)]
*  Well, Katie, I've gotten two different texts from different people at the Justice Department [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=98.46s)]
*  who just use the word insane to respond and react to this potential appointment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=102.78s)]
*  The debates are also exploding at the Justice Department because this goes against the kind [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=108.7s)]
*  of candidate, Republican or Democrat, that the DOJ sees as an appropriate candidate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=115.66s)]
*  And this is making everyone's head explode right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=123.54s)]
*  We're all watching it unfold in real time and I'm sure we'll have a lot more opinions on that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=125.54s)]
*  Matt Gaetz has no experience that would lend itself towards running the Department of Justice [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=129.54s)]
*  and everything that's involved there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=136.58s)]
*  President Trump is going to hit the Justice Department with a blowtorch and Matt Gaetz [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  is that torch. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=142.94s)]
*  We are in pure George Orwell 1984 land where, you know, they say black is white and we're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  supposed to believe it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=151.94s)]
*  So Merrick Garland and Obama's wingman Eric Holder are fine and the guy who, along with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=154.54s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan, was fighting tooth and nail to stop lawfare and the weaponization [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=160.06s)]
*  of the DOJ is being opposed by the very people that were either complicit or just downright [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=166.3s)]
*  silent, they're now outraged. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=172.5s)]
*  My question to everyone tonight, where was the righteous indignation over Obama's wingman, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=174.94s)]
*  Eric Holder, you know, the guy that vowed to, you know, when they go low, you kick them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=180.78s)]
*  You might recall this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=188.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=189.06s)]
*  Michelle Obama, I love her, you know. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=190.06s)]
*  She and my wife, like really tight, which always scares me and Barack. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=192.3s)]
*  But Michelle says that, you know, when they go low, we go high. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=198.3s)]
*  No. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=202.3s)]
*  No. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=203.3s)]
*  When they go low, we kick them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=204.3s)]
*  That's what this new Democratic Party is about. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=216.3s)]
*  Obama's AG wingman Eric Holder. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  Of course, that's nothing compared to his actions in office. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  Where was the outrage over Holders? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  Remember the Mexican gun-running scheme that led to the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  agent? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=233.74s)]
*  Where was the hysteria over Holders' secret federal surveillance of reporters at the APO [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=234.74s)]
*  and the Fox News Channel? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  That seems awfully relevant to the legacy media, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  Did anyone in the state-run media mob, did they ever speak out against the FISA abuse, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=248.22s)]
*  the weaponization of justice against Donald Trump from 2016 on? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=252.94s)]
*  What about the DOJ's witch hunt based on, let's see, Russian disinformation that was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=258.38s)]
*  bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  That was the basis of those FISA warrants. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, that dirty Russian disinformation dossier, that was used as the bulk of information [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=268.42s)]
*  to secure four FISA warrant applications to spy on candidate Trump, his transition team [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  and President Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  Did anyone at the state-run legacy media mob ever condemn this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=283.38s)]
*  Ever? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  No, the opposite occurred. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  They peddled these lies and conspiracy theories for three years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=289.34s)]
*  By the way, no wonder they've had no impact in this last election cycle. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  No wonder Americans do not and should not trust them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=298.82s)]
*  Did any Democrats or legacy media people lose sleep over the documented widespread anti-Trump [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=303.42s)]
*  bias at the DOJ, the FBI? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=309.38000000000005s)]
*  Where was the moral panic over the scheme to pre-bunk what was the very true Hunter [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  Biden laptop story? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=318.18s)]
*  We had 51 former intel officials never had to explain a thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=320.0s)]
*  They never examined Hunter's laptop. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  They never saw Hunter's laptop. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  They didn't know a thing about Hunter's laptop, but they all in unison were proclaiming, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=331.3s)]
*  it looks like Russian disinformation, only a few weeks before an election, that, according [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  to polls, had an impact on the outcome of the 2020 election. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=340.66s)]
*  Were they ever held accountable? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=346.26s)]
*  To this day, does anyone in the media mob care that it was Winken, Tony Blinken that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=347.26s)]
*  organized the disinformation campaign of the 51 former intel officials? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=352.98s)]
*  No. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=359.22s)]
*  How about the unequal system of justice? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=360.3s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=362.18s)]
*  Wasn't Mar-a-Lago rated over the issue of top secret classified documents? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=363.18s)]
*  But didn't Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, didn't they just get a little polite talking [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=368.54s)]
*  to after having troves of top secret classified document, in Joe's case, in four separate [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=375.38000000000005s)]
*  locations, and Hillary Clinton? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=382.66s)]
*  Why weren't their homes rated? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  Does that seem like equal justice under the law? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=386.94000000000005s)]
*  How come Hillary Clinton can destroy 33,000 subpoenaed emails—we'd never heard of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  it before—with bleach bit and then destroy devices with hammers and remove SIM cards? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=395.6s)]
*  And nobody in the Democratic Party, not one person, nobody in the legacy media mob, they [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=401.76s)]
*  never cared a whit. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  They didn't care at all. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  They hid it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=409.48s)]
*  They defended it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=410.48s)]
*  Anyone on the left concerned that a former president, current presidential candidate, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  got hit with 34 stacked felony charges based on this ridiculous novel legal theory after [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=417.24s)]
*  the statute of limitations were long passed, brought by a left-wing attorney general who [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=423.48s)]
*  campaigned on getting Donald Trump? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=428.44s)]
*  Did they ever speak out about that? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=431.04s)]
*  What about Catholics and angry parents that show up at school board meetings that were [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=432.88000000000005s)]
*  labeled extremists and terrorists or potential terrorists? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  Why were they—why were peaceful pro-life protesters? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=442.44000000000005s)]
*  Why were they targeted? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=446.68s)]
*  Over the past decade, we have witnessed spying, censorship, lawfare, corruption, intimidation, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=448.52s)]
*  extreme political bias, all from the Harris-Biden DOJ. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=453.88s)]
*  And, of course, you've got James Comey. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=457.04s)]
*  You've got the whole Mueller investigation, three long years, Russia, Russia, Russia, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=459.36s)]
*  the state-run media mob. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  They are now only worried about Matt Gaetz. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=465.24s)]
*  This is feigned selective moral outrage, and frankly, it's ridiculous. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=468.1s)]
*  Now, for years, the DOJ and the FBI and the Washington field office have been totally, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  completely out of control. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  We have been chronicling this regularly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  They have had a get Trump by any means necessary mentality. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=482.46000000000004s)]
*  And the American people, eight days ago, you saw through all of it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=487.12s)]
*  You didn't listen to the media, the celebrity endorsements, the people putting on the concerts [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=491.62s)]
*  for Kamala Harris, because they have no impact. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  They have, they have so overreached so often, people are sick of it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  And now they've completely lost the trust of more than half of the country. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=504.18s)]
*  And now change is coming to Washington, change that was promised. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=508.24s)]
*  And despite his time in Congress, Gaetz is not a Washington insider. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  Nobody would call him that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=515.76s)]
*  He is not well liked by the city's swamp creatures. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=517.28s)]
*  That might be a plus in my book. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=520.16s)]
*  But does he have an unyielding, fearless ability to disrupt the status quo, whether you agree [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=522.1s)]
*  or disagree? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=528.68s)]
*  And this is exactly why he became Donald Trump's pick for attorney general. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, this is not business as usual. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=535.52s)]
*  After last week's election, Donald Trump has a mandate to reform what I call these [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=538.08s)]
*  once great institutions to end once and for all the weaponization of justice in America, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=543.68s)]
*  to restore principles that I and so many of you hold near and dear to your heart. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=552.36s)]
*  To restore equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, flush out the political [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=558.92s)]
*  bias of the DOJ, the FBI in our intelligence community, restore these departments, these [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=564.36s)]
*  agencies to their original missions, not political, and their former greatness. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=571.64s)]
*  The FBI used to be formally one of the greatest law enforcement agencies on earth. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=578.36s)]
*  We've got to get them back to where they were. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=585.12s)]
*  Now as conservatives, we deeply believe in these principles. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=588.32s)]
*  And what has been done to Donald Trump over nine years and to Republicans can and should [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=592.96s)]
*  never ever, ever happen to any American Democrat or Republican ever again. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=599.96s)]
*  In other words, Republicans, they must pledge to never do to Democrats what was done to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  them and what was done to Donald Trump and what was done to Trump allies. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=615.48s)]
*  And today, after years of lawfare and two attempts on his life and nonstop media outrage [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=620.08s)]
*  and comparisons to Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini, Donald Trump returned to the White House for [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=625.64s)]
*  a meeting with Joe Biden in what could be a sign of things to come. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=631.2s)]
*  The meeting apparently went very well. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden was all smiles as the 45th, 46th, and 47th president exchanged kind words. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=637.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=644.88s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, elect and former president, and Donald, congratulations. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=645.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=650.88s)]
*  And looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=652.88s)]
*  Do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=657.88s)]
*  And we're going to get a chance to talk about some of that today. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=660.88s)]
*  It's good. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=663.88s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=664.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=665.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=667.04s)]
*  And politics is tough and it's, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=668.04s)]
*  today and I appreciate it very much. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=675.6s)]
*  A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=677.96s)]
*  And I very much appreciate that, Joe. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=681.96s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=684.96s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=685.96s)]
*  President Trump told the New York Post that Biden was very gracious, that it was very [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=688.8s)]
*  enjoyable, the meeting. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=692.68s)]
*  And based on White House pictures, Joe and Jill Biden seem very happy to see Donald Trump. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=695.16s)]
*  And the first lady even reportedly handed Trump a handwritten letter for his wife Melania, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=699.88s)]
*  welcoming her back to the White House. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, just this week, the vibes were kind of different when Jill and Kamala [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=708.04s)]
*  were seated next to each other at a Veterans Day event, as you can see right there. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=713.0s)]
*  Make no mistake, it is a new era in the Washington swamp. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=718.0s)]
*  And it appears, and I hope it's true, that Trump will have a new ally in the U.S. Senate, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=722.24s)]
*  the newly minted Majority Leader John Thune. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=727.92s)]
*  He is pledging to work to get the president's agenda through. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=730.6s)]
*  Time will tell. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=734.32s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=735.32s)]
*  It's a new day in the United States Senate and it's a new day in America. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=736.32s)]
*  The American people have loudly rejected the failed policies of the Biden-Harris-Schumer [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=739.64s)]
*  agenda. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=746.52s)]
*  And this Republican team is united. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=747.52s)]
*  We are on one team. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=750.64s)]
*  We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=752.72s)]
*  House to enact President Trump's agenda. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=755.64s)]
*  We have a mandate from the American people, a mandate not only to clean up the mess left [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=760.24s)]
*  by the Biden-Harris-Schumer agenda, but also to deliver on President Trump's priorities. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=766.0s)]
*  Time is short. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=773.84s)]
*  There's a lot of work to be done, but now is the time for Republicans to work together [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=774.84s)]
*  and get Donald Trump's agenda across the finish line. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqTwttDY8&t=778.72s)]
