# Sean Hannity: Biden has been wrong his whole career
**Fox News:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E)
*  Well, week knees at the DNC. Get this. Your Democratic Party, full of radicals, are so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=0.0s)]
*  terrified of their own members, according to a report from Politico, quote, Joe Biden's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=6.78s)]
*  top advisors are worried the Democratic convention could erupt in protests, so they're now pushing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=12.34s)]
*  to move it semi-online. What? An online convention in 2024? That's kind of pathetic, don't you [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=19.18s)]
*  think? Think of the slogan here. The Democratic Party, where our core voters are so hostile [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=27.86s)]
*  that in-person meetings are too risky. And of course, top Democrats are worried about [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=33.86s)]
*  protests and disruptions from the wannabe communists, their radical base in their party. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=38.68s)]
*  They're also worried about the optics of police clashing with their own extreme voters outside [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=44.7s)]
*  the convention. Now, this week in a desperate ploy to appease the pro-Hamas wing of his [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=50.34s)]
*  party, well, Joe Biden completely abandoned Israel and surrendered in the war on terrorism and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=55.94s)]
*  abandoned all the American hostages and Israeli hostages in Gaza. He's already blocking weapon [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=62.3s)]
*  shipments and planning to further penalize Israel if they finish the job against terrorists of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Hamas. By the way, wait a minute. Joe Biden withholding aid that was passed by Congress [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  unless Israel does what he wants. Oh, that sounds like a quid and a pro and a quo. Yeah, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=81.22s)]
*  Republicans are talking now about impeachment. We have 80 retired U.S. military leaders. They [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=87.06s)]
*  just issued an open letter reminding the president about Israel's vital role in America's national [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  security and all but begging him to rethink this horrific decision. By the way, it's incalculable [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=99.06s)]
*  in terms of the consequences for our allies and our enemies. Joe Biden simply doesn't care. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=105.94s)]
*  As a lifelong government worker who spends zero time in the military, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=111.86s)]
*  Joe Biden is often wrong about foreign policy. As a matter of fact, he's been wrong his whole career. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=115.86s)]
*  But never in doubt, by the way, and don't forget, a few years ago, Democrats impeached Donald Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=121.06s)]
*  Think about this, about the accusations that he temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  because he wanted to make sure that they wouldn't squander the money or misappropriate it like past [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=134.66s)]
*  leaders. They said it was a quid pro and a quo. Is this a quid pro quo with Joe? And now Biden [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=140.66s)]
*  is explicitly doing the same thing, bragging about it. No impeachment charge from congressional [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=147.78s)]
*  Democrats. Republicans are moving forward. Other than hating Donald Trump, the mainstream Democratic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=153.38s)]
*  Party has no values whatsoever. They have compromised any principles they may have stood [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=159.38s)]
*  for in the past. So it's kind of fitting that their commander in chief is nothing really [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=165.94s)]
*  but a spineless coward that lies about everything that is now emboldening radical Islamic terrorists [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=171.14s)]
*  worldwide. As the New York Post pointed out, Biden lied once every single minute during his recent [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  and rare sit down interview on fake news CNN. Take a look at his screen. He lied about inflation, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=185.7s)]
*  jobs, taxes, polls, Israel, Gaza, Iraq, and a lot more. But apparently, according to Joe, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=191.61999999999998s)]
*  he's ready and he's willing to debate Donald Trump. I hope and pray. Take a look. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=197.94s)]
*  Now, given Joe Biden's rampant dishonesty and cognitive decline, well, I'll believe that when [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  we see it. His vice president, meanwhile, is busy shouting out words describing women's bodies and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=213.7s)]
*  then laughing and giggling hysterically. Here's your giggling vice president. Once again, take a look. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=221.06s)]
*  I said very loudly, ovaries. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=228.98s)]
*  Ovaries. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=231.38s)]
*  Fallopian tubes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=234.66s)]
*  And fallopian tubes, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=236.18s)]
*  Uterus. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=238.18s)]
*  Fibroids. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=240.1s)]
*  And it was the funniest thing for me, at least. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=240.66s)]
*  Wow. Giggling vice president. The Democratic Party, they're not particularly well. And now [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=246.74s)]
*  they're facing a challenge from the hard left. That is Robert Kennedy Jr. so-called running as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=252.1s)]
*  an independent. But now Donald Trump thinks RFK might in fact be a Democratic plant. Take a look. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=257.38s)]
*  RFK Jr. is a Democrat plant, a radical left liberal who's been put in place [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=264.26s)]
*  in order to help crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the United States, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=270.82s)]
*  get reelected. A lot of people think that Jr. is a conservative. He's not. He's more liberal than [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=275.7s)]
*  anybody running on the Democrat side. A vote for Jr. would essentially be a wasted protest vote [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=281.78s)]
*  that could swing either way, but would only swing against the Democrats if Republicans knew the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=287.94s)]
*  true story about him. Jr. is totally anti-gun, an extreme environmentalist who makes the green [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=294.02s)]
*  news scammers look very conservative by comparison. A big time taxer he wants to tax you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  Now, it is important to remember RFK Jr.'s policies closely aligned with that of, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  yeah, the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party. He is a big supporter of the Green New [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=312.98s)]
*  Deal. He wants to legalize abortion. We played you the tape last night up to the very moment of birth. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=318.66s)]
*  That would be called infanticide. He also wants to slash the U.S. military budget, create a single [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=325.86s)]
*  payer socialized health care system. In 2018, he openly mocked conservatives. He bragged about being [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=332.42s)]
*  the NRA, the NPR's biggest fan. Wow, that says a lot. We'll tell you about what he said about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=339.94s)]
*  the NRA in a minute. I started thinking that, you know, 80% of Republicans are just Democrats who [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=345.94s)]
*  don't know what's going on. You know, I think a lot of it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=353.3s)]
*  people really aren't paying attention. And there is one NPR. Of course, public radio is not liberal. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=362.42s)]
*  It's just, you know, neutral. It's just truth, right? If you're a Republican, if you're conservative, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  once you know Kennedy's record, I promise you're not going to be voting for Kennedy. Just know [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=377.3s)]
*  that a vote for RFK Jr. in this particular case is a vote for a slightly younger Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=381.94s)]
*  And like Bernie Sanders, RFK Jr. has a lot of nice things to say about the world's worst [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=388.82s)]
*  communists. Take a look. Woe's Castro like a person. He was incredibly charming. In fact, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=394.02s)]
*  I went with Sheryl and we spent a day with him and my kids, you know, I don't know, about two years [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=400.5s)]
*  before he died. And he was very, very kind to me and to my family. And, you know, he had a very open, engaged mind. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=406.26s)]
*  Well, a murdering dictator thug. Well, he's actually charming and very kind to me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, if you want another Biden term while voting for a wealthy socialist, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=424.74s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is probably your guy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_upB_CoK2E&t=429.21999999999997s)]
