# Lara Trump sends message to Mark Cuban after insulting female Trump supporters
**Fox News:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc)
*  Now, here with reaction, RNC co-chair Laura Trump is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=0.0s)]
*  You want to react to this? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Which part, Sean? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=6.8s)]
*  How long do we have for this? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=7.8s)]
*  I got to be honest with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=8.8s)]
*  You've got as much time as you need. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=9.8s)]
*  You're a smart, intelligent woman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=10.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is— [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=11.8s)]
*  And powerful, too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=12.8s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=13.8s)]
*  Don't tell Mark Cuban that, because he'll tell you differently. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=14.8s)]
*  But the whole thing is really amazing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They have been incredibly direct in what they think of the American people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Go back to Hillary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=25.72s)]
*  Deplorable, irredeemable, smelly Walmart people, remember that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=26.72s)]
*  Remember how they've called us all fascists and Nazis? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=31.36s)]
*  Obviously, we're garbage, according to Joe Biden and any woman who would consider Donald [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump, who wants, I don't know, a great economy, safety and security around our country, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=38.56s)]
*  a closed border, peace instead of wars around the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=43.44s)]
*  Apparently, we are weak and stupid. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=46.8s)]
*  Well, I don't think so, Mark Cuban. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=48.96s)]
*  Take a look around. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=51.2s)]
*  You obviously heard from Suzy Wiles. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=52.32s)]
*  She had that very nice post. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=54.28s)]
*  You had Kellyanne Conway, the first woman, by the way, who ever successfully ran a presidential [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=55.84s)]
*  campaign when Donald Trump won in 2016. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=60.84s)]
*  And by the way, before it was actually politically advantageous for anybody, and before people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=64.36s)]
*  were really doing things like this, Donald Trump, when he built Trump Tower, Sean, hired [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=69.76s)]
*  a woman to do that job. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=74.16s)]
*  If you go look at the Trump Organization, the top executives and some of the people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  who have been with Donald Trump the longest are women in his company. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  This whole idea that any of us are being called all of these names is totally ridiculous. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=90.12s)]
*  You know what the American people want to hear about? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=91.12s)]
*  How are you going to make my life better? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=92.64s)]
*  What is it you're going to be able to do over the next four years that is going to be a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  reason I'm going to vote for you? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=98.2s)]
*  Donald Trump did it for four years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=99.84s)]
*  We had a great country when he was president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Women are smart enough, Mark Cuban, to know that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  I think it's really amazing to see how outraged they were with Donald Trump in a garbage truck [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=108.48s)]
*  driving to a rally in Wisconsin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=113.48s)]
*  People absolutely love this, and it's driving them crazy on the left. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=116.16s)]
*  They want more of that, not less. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=120.48s)]
*  This is a fun, joyful campaign on the Trump side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Look over at the Kamala Harris side. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=126.2s)]
*  They're melting down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=127.64s)]
*  They're collapsing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=128.64s)]
*  I got to tell you, it's a pretty wonderful thing to see. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=130.32s)]
*  Look at all of the surrogates out there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=134.04s)]
*  Well, you got Mark Cuban, no strong, intelligent woman would support Donald Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=136.68s)]
*  Bill Clinton, well, they can rightly be alive today if only we'd vet these illegal immigrants. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=141.6s)]
*  And I know the economy was better under Donald Trump than it is under Kamala, but I still [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=146.24s)]
*  want you to vote for Kamala. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=150.36s)]
*  Then, of course, you got Gretchen Whitmer mocking Catholics and Christians. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=151.84s)]
*  You got Joe calling Trump supporters garbage. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=156.56s)]
*  We've got Barack Obama lecturing African-American men, his words the brothers, and calling them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  misogynistic and sexist. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Stacey Abrams calling African-American men racist and sexist. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=170.76s)]
*  And then, when all else fails, everybody joins in unison and says, you know, fascist, Nazi, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=175.04s)]
*  racist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=180.72s)]
*  That does not seem like a closing argument to inspire the American people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=181.72s)]
*  And now they have actors and actresses, Hollywood elites, trying to, oh, let's run an ad and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=185.84s)]
*  tell women to lie to their husbands. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=191.28s)]
*  That's a great message. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and actually, that ad I find very confusing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  The only place a woman has a choice? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=198.72s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=200.88s)]
*  We live in the United States of America. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=201.88s)]
*  This is the greatest country on earth to be a woman. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  It's really outrageous, but this is the problem, Sean, when you actually don't have a closing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  argument, when you know that the product you're trying to sell to the American people is something [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=212.12s)]
*  they just simply don't want to buy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=216.5s)]
*  No one wants to buy four years of Kamala Harris. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=218.48s)]
*  We've just suffered through that for the past four, and we could not survive another four [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=221.52s)]
*  just like we've had. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=226.92s)]
*  And I think we all know they would be far worse if Kamala truly became president. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=227.92s)]
*  There's part of me that feels like some of these people do not want to see her in that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=232.24s)]
*  White House. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=235.88s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden is one of those people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=236.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=239.24s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if he might cast a ballot for Donald Trump this election. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=240.24s)]
*  But the truth is, it doesn't matter what they call us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=244.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they say about us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=247.54s)]
*  It doesn't matter how many times they criticize us and try to knock us down. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  People are proudly out there voting for Donald Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=254.42s)]
*  And I hope everybody paying attention right now thinks of somebody, think of one person [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=257.06s)]
*  at least that you know who has not voted, who might not go out and vote in this election. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=261.98s)]
*  Text them right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=266.78s)]
*  Call them right now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=267.9s)]
*  Take them tomorrow if you have early voting still going on in your state and take them [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=268.96s)]
*  to the polling location to vote. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=273.3s)]
*  That's how we win this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't want this stuff anymore in our country, Sean. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=276.78s)]
*  We want a successful country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=279.46s)]
*  We want the American Dream back. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=281.34s)]
*  We want a strong country again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  And we know who brought that to us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=284.94s)]
*  It was Donald Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=286.38s)]
*  And I'll tell you something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=287.61999999999995s)]
*  Strong, smart women out there all across America are proudly casting a vote for Donald Trump. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=289.14s)]
*  You can see my I Voted sticker. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=294.5s)]
*  I went and voted for Donald Trump today, and it was one of the proudest moments of my life. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=296.38s)]
*  Strong, smart, intelligent women are voting for Donald Trump. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=300.5s)]
*  African Americans never did better. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=305.42s)]
*  And we put the numbers up many times in terms of economic growth and gains and unemployment, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  all-time lows. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=314.66s)]
*  That happened under Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=316.1s)]
*  Those are just facts. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=318.66s)]
*  Laura Trump, great to see you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvshNv5yxc&t=321.70000000000005s)]
