# Robert Kraft: Americans who care about their country need to 'speak up now'
**Fox News:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA)
*  Now, amid the latest unrest, well, Robert Kraft is publishing this full-page ad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=0.0s)]
*  It'll be in major newspapers across the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  In the next two days, it reads, in part, instead of colleges and universities teaching the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=7.94s)]
*  core principles of free speech and debate that our country was founded on, they are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=12.44s)]
*  emboldening hatred that is tearing their campuses and our youth apart. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now with more, he's the founder of the Foundation to Combat Anti-Semitism, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  and also the owner of the New England Patriots. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=27.84s)]
*  Our friend Robert Kraft is back with us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=31.16s)]
*  You went to Columbia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=33.82s)]
*  You watched what happened last night. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=36.08s)]
*  You had already taken a strong stand. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=38.36s)]
*  You took it during the Super Bowl. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=41.24s)]
*  You have taken it since October 7th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=43.2s)]
*  And look where we are. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=46.2s)]
*  Robert, I never thought we'd see this in our lifetime. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  You and me both, Sean. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=52.96s)]
*  You know, I think our universities were one of our competitive advantages as a country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=55.6s)]
*  And I think what's going on now throughout America is scaring a lot of people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=65.44s)]
*  And they want to know who are going to win this battle. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=72.0s)]
*  And I just ask all your good listeners who care about this country to speak up now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=74.36s)]
*  You know, universities used to be where you had critical debate and different points of view. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  We didn't teach hate and intimidation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=90.44s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, and maybe I'll use a football analogy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=91.44s)]
*  Maybe let's say the New England Patriots have the number one draft pick, and you have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=96.2s)]
*  a Tom Brady star in the making that's going to go in the first round, first pick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=101.36s)]
*  And you found out that that individual was a part of any of what we've been witnessing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=109.2s)]
*  on television and believe that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=113.36s)]
*  Would you pick that player? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=115.6s)]
*  No. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=117.6s)]
*  And I know Tom Brady pretty well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=118.6s)]
*  And he represents the best values of America. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=123.0s)]
*  And actually— [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=127.44s)]
*  Oh, I agree with that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=128.44s)]
*  I'm not insinuating anything else. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=129.44s)]
*  I was not insinuating anything else. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=132.44s)]
*  He had the privilege of picking a pretty special guy, number three, this year, who I think [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=136.88s)]
*  we're very proud of and represents—his family represents the values that all of us [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  in America hold dear. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  And we really have—the reason I took these ads out, I want people to know that good people—and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  They've come to our foundation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=161.68s)]
*  They really care. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=163.12s)]
*  And they have to speak up and not be silent, the way Martin Luther King spoke about it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=165.04s)]
*  with Clarence. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=171.12s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=172.68s)]
*  I wish more people like yourself of prominence that have—when Robert Kraft speaks, a lot [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=176.56s)]
*  of people listen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=184.64s)]
*  I've known you as a friend for many years, and I'm really proud of the fact that you've [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=185.64s)]
*  taken a strong stand. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=189.88s)]
*  I remember when the issue of social justice came up in the NFL. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=191.6s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=196.12s)]
*  Didn't you go to your players and say, if there's any charity that is near and dear [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=197.12s)]
*  to your heart, whatever you—whatever money you raise or put into it, that you would match [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=202.16s)]
*  it? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  And didn't you go out with some of your players and— [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Match 100 percent. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=212.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=214.76s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=216.76s)]
*  And it's true, you know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Look, I'm one of the greatest beneficiaries of what America has to offer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  And I got a full academic scholarship to Columbia. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  I dreamt big dreams. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=231.64s)]
*  I went through tough times, but it's the greatest country in the world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm privileged, among other things, to own an NFL franchise in my hometown. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=239.0s)]
*  And I didn't have a car until I was 25. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=244.36s)]
*  I want to keep those values alive for everyone that comes to this country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=247.84s)]
*  You know, I had a dinner tonight with a woman who runs one of the best hospitals in Boston. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=252.8s)]
*  And she came here from Nicaragua at age 10. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=260.0s)]
*  And she lived the American dream. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=264.32s)]
*  And they left Somoza in Nicaragua. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=266.82s)]
*  And now she's worried about what's happening here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=269.48s)]
*  Good people care, and we just need to band together and speak out and not to be afraid. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=273.35999999999996s)]
*  We need empathy here and not hatred. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=284.0s)]
*  So, your ad will be in major newspapers starting tomorrow, coast to coast. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=285.0s)]
*  And I hope people will read the entire letter that you are putting in this ad and really [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  take the time to contemplate the message that you are trying to send. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=297.76s)]
*  It is a critical one at a critical point, and I admire you for doing it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=301.64s)]
*  Robert Kraft, thank you again for being with us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3mcHfeubjA&t=306.08s)]
