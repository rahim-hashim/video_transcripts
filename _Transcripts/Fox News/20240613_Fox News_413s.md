# Ted Cruz: Democrats are 'laying out the red carpet' for terrorists
**Fox News:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ)
*  Here with more, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know, with the inspector general, everything in between. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=2.4s)]
*  What frustrates me, Senator, is they have known this the entire time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=5.2s)]
*  They have lied to us the entire time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=10.76s)]
*  Now they try to create a false image that in 153 daysâ€”that was the date Joe Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=13.1s)]
*  decided to move forward with an executive order in January. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=19.18s)]
*  He said he had no power to go forward with. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=22.52s)]
*  Along with that, you have a Department of Homeland Security secretary who lies with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=26.32s)]
*  him, vice president who lies with him, and then you have an attorney general that allows [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=30.76s)]
*  Joe Biden to aid in a bet in the law breaking and not enforce the law. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=35.52s)]
*  On top of everything else, it's like one big conspiracy to basically allow the United [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=40.76s)]
*  States to get attacked, and it's going to happen, Senator. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=45.36s)]
*  It's not if. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=48.32s)]
*  Sean, that is exactly right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=49.32s)]
*  Every word you said in the opening monologue is exactly accurate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  We are today at a greater risk for a major terrorist attack than at any time since September [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=54.98s)]
*  11th. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  And we have seen for three-and-a-half years a wide-open border, effectively an invitation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=64.22s)]
*  from Joe Biden and the Democrats for terrorists to come into this country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=69.28s)]
*  We have seen Customs and Border Patrol instructed to be on the lookout for Hamas terrorists, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=73.46s)]
*  be on the lookout for Hezbollah terrorists, be on the lookout for Palestinian Islamic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=78.74s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=83.26s)]
*  All of them have called for jihad against America. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=84.26s)]
*  Iran has called for jihad against America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=87.26s)]
*  And you look at these eight Tajik terrorists that came in, they came in from Tajikistan, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=90.7s)]
*  they have ties to ISIS-K, the radical terrorist group. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  They crossed the border illegally at the southern border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=103.66s)]
*  They were apprehended. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden had them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats had them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  All he had to do was put the terrorists on a plane and send them home, but they didn't. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=109.66s)]
*  They quote, vetted them, which means he patted them on the back of the head and said, I guess [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=113.62s)]
*  we need more terrorists. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=117.22s)]
*  And they let them go. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=118.56s)]
*  And understand, the news you just broke, everyone needs to understand what this is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=119.94s)]
*  The FBI caught them in a sting for terrorism across three cities, New York, L.A., and Philadelphia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=124.18s)]
*  ISIS-K, the Tajiks and ISIS-K are the same people that carried out the terror attack [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=132.46s)]
*  in Moscow, Russia that killed 145 people at an opera house. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=138.66s)]
*  And sadly, Sean, we're living on borrowed time because the Democrats are opening the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=144.06s)]
*  door and laying out the red carpet for terrorists to come and threaten the lives of Americans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=148.94s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  And there was a poll that recently came out, and I know the media mob was shocked by the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=157.02s)]
*  poll. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  62 percent of Americans actually believe that if you're going to come into our country, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  you've got to come in legally, respect our laws, our borders, our sovereignty. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=166.54s)]
*  It's really that simple. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  And 62 percent of Americans think that if you enter this country illegally, you should [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  be sent home. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=177.26s)]
*  Now, Australia does that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=178.5s)]
*  I don't see Australia get criticized very often. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=181.1s)]
*  If you try to make it to the shores of Australia, they will meet you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=183.62s)]
*  If you need medical attention, it will be provided, but you'll never put foot on Australian [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  soil. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=192.66s)]
*  They will give you food and water and supplies to turn around and go home. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=193.74s)]
*  Now, why don't we do that here? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=198.62s)]
*  Because Joe Biden and the Democrats put politics above our national security. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=202.3s)]
*  They put it above the lives of Americans. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=206.58s)]
*  We have seen, it's amazing how people's views change when we have a criminal invasion [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  of the United States with 11 million people crossing illegally. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=212.62s)]
*  Every single day, Joe Biden and the Democrats are releasing gang members. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=216.34s)]
*  They're releasing murderers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  They're releasing child rapists. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=221.38s)]
*  We see week after week after week another American killed, another child raped by illegal [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=223.04s)]
*  immigrants that Joe Biden and the Democrats have released. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=228.32s)]
*  And when it comes to terrorists, we have seen hundreds. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, you put up the stats a minute ago about China and Russia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=233.76s)]
*  If I'd have told you 30,000 Chinese are going to invade this country, I've been down at [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=238.04s)]
*  the border. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=242.48s)]
*  I've seen hundreds of military-age males from China just lined up and they keep saying, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=243.48s)]
*  I want to go to this city. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=248.92s)]
*  I want to go to this city. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=249.92s)]
*  Every city in America is a border city. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=251.16s)]
*  If I'd have told you 12,000 Russians. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=253.88s)]
*  If I'd have told you 12,000 Russians. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=254.88s)]
*  Fifty-six thousand Chinese nationals. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=255.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=257.88s)]
*  Now, do you think they're coming here, Senator, because they want a better life for themselves [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=258.88s)]
*  and their children? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=262.56s)]
*  They buying up our ranch land, farm land, thousands and thousands of acres and land [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=264.36s)]
*  near military installations just because they like the view? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Or is it because they're probably enemies of our state? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=273.2s)]
*  Look, they are invading this country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=277.36s)]
*  And one thing to understand, it's not just Biden. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=280.36s)]
*  Every single Democrat in the Senate has voted for these open borders over and over and over [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=288.8s)]
*  They go, John Tester goes to Montana and he tries to pretend he's not for open borders. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=289.8s)]
*  And then he votes for open borders over and over and over again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  Bob Casey in Pennsylvania does the same thing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  Sherrod Brown in Ohio. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=299.36s)]
*  My opponent in Texas, Colin Allred, has voted over and over and over again in favor of open [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  borders against deporting criminal illegal aliens who physically assault police officers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=307.16s)]
*  This is the position of today's Democrat Party. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  They look at open borders and it is their policy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=316.6s)]
*  It's what they want because they see them all as future Democrat voters. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=319.22s)]
*  And if people have to die to keep them in power, sadly, Democrats are willing to do [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=323.3s)]
*  that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  For the state of Texas, honestly, it's been you and Governor Greg Abbott on the front [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  lines fighting for the safety and security of the people in your state. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=333.32s)]
*  And what do you get as a matter of thanks? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=337.32s)]
*  You get to be the number one target of Chuck Schumer and, you know, $200 million are going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  to be thrown at you in negative ads by your far left Schumer supporting opponent in Texas. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=345.52s)]
*  Great. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=351.2s)]
*  Lucky you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=352.2s)]
*  Well, they're coming after me with everything they've got. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=353.2s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=355.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and George Soros are spending millions of dollars to go after me. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=356.52s)]
*  Schumer has said I'm his number one target in the country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=361.24s)]
*  Obama has said I'm his number one target in the country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=363.68s)]
*  Colin Allred is already spending millions of dollars in TV ads. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=366.56s)]
*  I haven't run any TV ads because we don't have the money. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I want to encourage people go to Ted Cruz dot org, Ted Cruz dot org, Ted Cruz dot [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=372.56s)]
*  org. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Make a contribution right now because we are getting massively outspent and the left [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  wants Texas to be a haven for illegal immigrants. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=383.48s)]
*  They want more of this invasion. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=386.82000000000005s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do in this race in Texas. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=388.72s)]
*  And they're spending that money not only to hurt you, but they want Texas blue desperately [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=391.56s)]
*  and they're paying any amount of money they have to to try and make that happen. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=395.92s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLED0lOvEBQ&t=401.08000000000004s)]
