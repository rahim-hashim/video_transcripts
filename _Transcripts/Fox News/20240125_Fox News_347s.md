# Texas Attorney General responds to National Guard-feds border standoff
**Fox News:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c)
*  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxson and another state leader who is supporting Texas tonight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=0.0s)]
*  South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem good to see you both [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=6.0s)]
*  Governor Noem first of all thank you and thanks to all the other Republican governors and frankly [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=9.32s)]
*  If Democratic governors were even being honest this problem has become so massive for them. They should join in supporting you as well [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely every single one of them should join us. This is about our Constitution [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=23.32s)]
*  This is about us standing united the 13 original colonies would have never signed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=27.74s)]
*  The Constitution or ratified it if they didn't know that they didn't have the protections to defend themselves [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=32.42s)]
*  And so that's really what this is all about. I'm gonna be at the border tomorrow [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=37.14s)]
*  I'm going to be there to tell the Texas National Guard to tell those border patrol agents those folks that are in very difficult [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=41.26s)]
*  Situations and the public administration within the state of Texas that we're not only with them that we have continued to be with them for the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=48.06s)]
*  Last several years South Dakota has deployed our National Guard to support them and stand alongside them three separate times [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=54.54s)]
*  Over the last several years and we're going to continue to do that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=60.78s)]
*  A lot of people talk and a lot of people criticize we take action and right now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=63.34s)]
*  I'm so proud of what Texas is doing to defend itself will be right there beside them [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=67.7s)]
*  We'll do everything we can to make sure this invasion stops. Are you willing to send a guard from from your state governor? I [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=72.0s)]
*  Already have three times my even my Lakota helicopters have been down there conducting surveillance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=79.94s)]
*  So they absolutely are I'm willing to send National Guard down there to stand alongside [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=85.06s)]
*  I want it to be different arrangements this time if we're going to enforce Texas law [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=89.96s)]
*  And if I'm going to have the ability to use these soldiers in a way that's effective, but that'll be absolutely fantastic [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=94.3s)]
*  They have enjoyed partnering partnering with the Texas National Guard in the past and I'll tell you one thing Sean that is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=100.1s)]
*  That is interesting to me. There's nobody that supports Joe Biden's policies nobody in this country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=106.5s)]
*  The public doesn't support it these Border Patrol agents don't support it if you talk to anyone in ice that's down there on the ground [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  That's seen this war zone. They don't they don't support what he is doing six million people have come into this country illegally [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  It is an invasion. It is a war zone more than six [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=123.78s)]
*  Humanitarian it is it is it's an inhumane situation and it is definitely [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=127.18s)]
*  One of those instances where we need to stand up and defend our state rights and this decision that came out of the Supreme Court [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=133.62s)]
*  It did not say that Texas couldn't defend itself [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=139.78s)]
*  It said that they could take down the razor wire [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=143.34s)]
*  But did not declare that Texas could not defend itself [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=145.9s)]
*  And I believe that still protects our state rights and that we can certainly take action [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  the only way Joe Biden would be able to stop the Texas National Guard from from taking action is he would have to act to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  activate them under Title 10 and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=159.82s)]
*  Federally put them on active duty status to keep them from engaging and being under their commander-in-chief [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=161.94s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see what Joe Biden does here because he is making very poor decisions destroying our country and all the power of our [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=169.5s)]
*  Constitution stands with the states [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=177.66s)]
*  Let me go to you Ken Paxson. I'll go to these FBI [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=179.86s)]
*  Luminaries, I mean to attend former FBI executives [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=183.62s)]
*  Even those that oversaw the FBI's intelligence counterterrorism criminal and training operations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=187.38s)]
*  They are saying that the US has never suffered an invasion of the homeland [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=193.78s)]
*  And yet one is unfolding now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=199.22s)]
*  Talking about military age foreigners now [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=202.38s)]
*  What's gonna happen? Joe Biden seems to be giving deadline after deadline. Is he threatening for federal troops to confront? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=205.9s)]
*  Guard troops in Texas. Is that is that where he's headed here? Is he want to showdown in Texas? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=214.38s)]
*  Look first of all, thank you to Governor Noem and the rest of the governor for standing with us [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  I think this is not just a Texas issue now. It's a it's a national issue [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=225.3s)]
*  As far as this terrorist threat, I've been [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Worried about this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=232.62s)]
*  It's chilling to hear the report that John Solomon gave and how that could potentially affect my state and really affect the entire country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=233.5s)]
*  Long after Joe Biden is gone. We're gonna be dealing with potential terrorist threats as far as a showdown [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=239.86s)]
*  I don't know what Joe Biden's gonna do so far. It seems like every decision he's made has been a bad decision for our country [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=245.98s)]
*  He is cooperating not just cooperating [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=253.1s)]
*  But he's literally in partnership with these cartels in the old days [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=255.26s)]
*  They used to come and try to hide and run away from Border Patrol [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=258.66s)]
*  Joe Biden's cut a deal somehow where these cartels transport people directly to the Border Patrol and then they move them around the country [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=261.62s)]
*  So we're in a terrible situation [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=269.7s)]
*  Nothing like this country has ever seen before and I fear the consequences of Joe Biden's decisions for the next years [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=271.66s)]
*  Well, he's the one that's not upholding the law the Supreme Court decision as governor Noem pointed out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=278.62s)]
*  There are a lot of areas where Texas is free to continue to put up wire [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=284.5s)]
*  They don't have to allow this to happen [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=288.3s)]
*  But it's it's beginning to look like that Joe Biden is basically, you know drawing a line in the sand and he's saying that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=290.06s)]
*  You know the feds are gonna come marching into Texas and rip down your razor wire and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=297.66s)]
*  Governor Abbott saying we're just gonna put it right back up again [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=303.66s)]
*  Look, I think I support the governor. He's gonna stay I talked to him today for a little while and we talked about this very issue [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=307.3s)]
*  And I guarantee you he's gonna stand strong. He'll keep putting razor wire up. We'll keep blocking the border [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=312.74s)]
*  We'll keep doing everything that we need to do to protect our state [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=317.9s)]
*  Despite the fact that this ruling this Supreme Court ruling was so wrong and has such a detrimental effect on our state and our country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=321.3s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe it. Anyway, we really appreciate your time. Thank you. Governor Paxton and Governor Noem [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMyXD-z5K3c&t=329.46000000000004s)]
