# Everyone is now dumber for having listened to this: Joe Concha
**Fox News:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ)
*  All right here with reaction our media guru Fox News contributor the one and only Joe conscious with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know what my favorites are here. I mean ageism or he can ride a bike, but didn't he also fall off that bike? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=5.44s)]
*  I just have this vague memory of that, you know, I mean all the anger poor liberal Joe [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=13.44s)]
*  I thought he was gonna have an aneurysm this morning. He was so angry [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=19.78s)]
*  But however, it just it fits the pattern it is this has been going on for a long time [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=23.72s)]
*  They have ignored it. They'll make a big deal of if Trump mixes up Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=28.84s)]
*  But meanwhile is lucid for you know, two straight hours and interviews that I've had with them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=35.08s)]
*  Let's not take that into consideration, but you're I guess it's a predictable reaction, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=40.92s)]
*  Sean I mean some of those clips you played are incredible. I mean that CNN clip is something else [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  They think that he looked during that disaster of a press conference last night more youthful and more engaged [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=52.04s)]
*  I mean at no point in their rambling incoherent responses [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Like I watched last night where they even close anything that could be considered a rational thought [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Everyone in this country is now dumber for having listened to that analysis. But as far as Rachel Maddow's bike argument [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=65.52s)]
*  I mean the real question is can Joe Biden successfully ride a bike? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=71.52s)]
*  I mean we must have video of him somewhere from last summer where he actually falls down while riding a bike right in front of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=74.88s)]
*  Reporters and and Rachel's defense is just about the best unintentional comedy you'll ever see [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=80.96s)]
*  I mean my kids could ride a bike by the time they were four years old [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=85.78s)]
*  So I'm not sure how operating, you know a Schwinn proves that a person is mentally fit and remember Rachel supposed to be the smart [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=88.46s)]
*  One over there. She should just go back to working one day a week at this point [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  But but overall seriously, can you believe the craptastic week this president has had? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the worst of his presidency at least going back to the Afghanistan withdrawal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=103.44s)]
*  He couldn't remember Sean the name of Hamas [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  He said he spoke to Francois Mitterrand recently who only died, you know, almost 40 years ago [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  Did he get Napoleon's voicemail? How'd that go? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  And and he also said he spoke to what Helmut Kohl the German Chancellor who died years ago as well instead [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=117.66s)]
*  He spoke to him about January 6th. Uh-huh [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=123.46s)]
*  I mean then the geniuses at the White House comm shop [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=125.58s)]
*  They thought it was a swell idea to put Joe Biden out there hastily assembled press conference at 745 last night [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=128.38s)]
*  And we saw how that went. It was Joe Biden as Grandpa Simpson [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=134.14s)]
*  We're now apparently Mexico borders on Gaza according to our commander-in-chief [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=137.5s)]
*  But you've been talking about this for years Sean and now perhaps even Democrats are finally waking up to the fact that this man [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=141.17999999999998s)]
*  Should not be all in office for think about it about five more years if he wins reelection [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  That's what we're talking about here [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=151.14s)]
*  And and this is a guy who expects to leave the country while going on more vacations than Clark Rizwold and many voters are saying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=152.26s)]
*  No, give us somebody else, please [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I call it that my memory my memory is fine. I'm an elderly man. I know what the hell I'm doing press conference [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=160.1s)]
*  the only one that had a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=165.82s)]
*  Decent amount of honesty in his in his comments was Paul Buggala [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=168.1s)]
*  Saying that anybody with a functioning brain knows that it was a terrible report and presser and when you think about it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  You know the list of prominent names from the Obama and Clinton era are growing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=179.78s)]
*  I mean you've got David Axelrod you got Van Jones [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=184.94s)]
*  Obama people you got James Carville now Buggala Clinton people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=189.34s)]
*  They're stating the obvious got Maureen Dowd at the New York Times [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=193.82s)]
*  These are pretty prominent left-wing voices in the country that I think probably people will listen to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=197.34s)]
*  Are they saying are they going to take it the next step that he's not qualified to be president? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=204.1s)]
*  That's the problem Sean. It's it's like a math equation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=210.14s)]
*  You know a plus B equals C if C plus B equals a they had the a part which is Joe Biden [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=212.42s)]
*  Should not be running for office again when 76% of Americans in an NBC News poll just taken don't think that he has the mental [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=218.26s)]
*  Fitness for the job. I mean that is a devastating number [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=225.12s)]
*  The problem is the B part of the equation a Joe should drop out, but who replaces him right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=227.98s)]
*  It's like saying all right this quarterback can't play anymore. He's horrible. Okay. Who's the backup? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=234.02s)]
*  Is it Kamala Harris because if she's the emergency plan she may end up losing 45 states if she's the nominee. I mean, that's how [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=238.02s)]
*  Absolutely untrusted and unpopular she is with Democratic voters. So then you look to Gavin Newsom, I guess maybe I mean look at his record in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=245.66s)]
*  California and then the bench from there you tell me who backfills Joe Biden at this point and also you tell me if Joe [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=253.78s)]
*  Biden looks like a guy who's ready to hand over the keys to the car at this point [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=259.74s)]
*  He doesn't look like it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=262.62s)]
*  He thinks he could beat Donald Trump again [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=263.9s)]
*  And he seems to be the last one to know that he has a cognitive decline Joe Contra [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=265.5s)]
*  We appreciate it best media guy out there not part of the the blue checkmark [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  Media mob cult that's a credit to him. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X--HXKwOfQ&t=276.26000000000005s)]
