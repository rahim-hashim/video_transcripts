# Speaker Mike Johnson: Biden has the executive authority to fix this
**Fox News:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0)
*  Joining us now exclusively to react to this and much more, Speaker of the House, Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=0.0s)]
*  Johnson of Louisiana. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=4.34s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=5.82s)]
*  First, reports were that they ganged up on you yesterday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=8.78s)]
*  Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Any truth to that? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=14.08s)]
*  Well, the reports were pretty accurate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=15.08s)]
*  They said that I was on an island by myself, and it was me versus everyone else in the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=17.52s)]
*  room. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=22.38s)]
*  What the liberal media doesn't understand, Sean, is that if you're here in Washington [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=23.38s)]
*  and you're described as a leader that's on an island by themselves, it probably means [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  you're standing with the American people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=30.36s)]
*  And that's what I did yesterday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=31.84s)]
*  I reminded the president and all involved that the number one issue in America is that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=32.92s)]
*  open border, the catastrophe that we have, that President Biden himself designed, that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=37.72s)]
*  he caused and created. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=42.96s)]
*  And I told him, just as I have many times before, he must address it with his executive [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=45.0s)]
*  authority. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=49.16s)]
*  We can't wait any longer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=50.16s)]
*  My understanding is you're referring to this as a process CR. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  This would be the fourth continuing resolution. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=55.36s)]
*  In Washington, these bills, the appropriations bills, should have been done by October 1. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=59.32s)]
*  As you know, apparently six of them are expected to be done by March 8th and another six by, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=63.72s)]
*  I believe, March 22nd. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=68.88s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=70.72s)]
*  Do you have faith and confidence that finally those appropriations will get done? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=71.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a fight, Sean. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=76.32s)]
*  It's taken a long time. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=79.08s)]
*  We broke the omnibus fever in Washington, where the Democrats, usually in the Senate, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=80.56s)]
*  would jam the House right before Christmas every year with a 4,000-page piece of legislation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=85.08s)]
*  that spends over a trillion and a half dollars. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=89.92s)]
*  That's no way to run a railroad. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  So what we did was we broke this up so that we could actually amend and negotiate and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=94.0s)]
*  fight for policy initiatives on 12 separate appropriations bills. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=98.6s)]
*  We've done that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  We've got an agreement now, and now they'll be passed in two packages, because, as you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  noted, the calendar's run out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=108.52s)]
*  But this was an important thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=110.16s)]
*  We have got to break the cycle and the way Washington works. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=111.16s)]
*  We've got to reform budgeting and spending, and we're going to have an opportunity to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=114.04s)]
*  do that going forward, because we had this hard fight right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=117.24s)]
*  There are two big issues, I know, that are on the minds of conservatives and many Republicans, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=121.04s)]
*  and that is the issue of Joe Biden's wide-open borders, nearly 10 million illegal immigrants. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=124.92s)]
*  Former top FBI officials have described this, their words, as an invasion of military-age [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=131.6s)]
*  men. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=137.52s)]
*  We have described the countries we know they're coming from. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=138.52s)]
*  Iran, number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=141.08s)]
*  Syria, satellite country Syria. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=143.28s)]
*  Egypt, home of the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=145.68s)]
*  Afghanistan, home of al-Qaeda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=147.52s)]
*  Our top geopolitical foe, China, tens and tens of thousands from there and 10,000-plus [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=149.88s)]
*  from Russia, our number two geopolitical foe. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=156.16s)]
*  Is anything going to be done, any part of this deal going to deal with the issue of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's wide-open borders? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  We never stop working on it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, we passed H.R.2 almost a year ago now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's let it sit on the desk collecting dust. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=169.24s)]
*  We'll continue to push it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=171.8s)]
*  Every piece of it, every initiative, because listen, now the catastrophe is having real [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=173.16s)]
*  world consequences around the country, as you know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=177.16s)]
*  Violent crimes, brutal murders, Lake and Riley and others that even in my home state of Louisiana [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=180.12s)]
*  aggravated rape this past week by illegal aliens because Joe Biden is catching them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=185.8s)]
*  and releasing them into the country, and it's caused an absolute catastrophic effect. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=190.76s)]
*  And it will continue, Sean, sadly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=195.36s)]
*  So we have to push. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=197.08s)]
*  The president has the executive authority to fix it right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=198.4s)]
*  I told him at the White House yesterday, one on one, and in the group, I told him, Mr. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=201.4s)]
*  President, if you just issue an executive order that reinstates remain in Mexico, sir, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  the Border Patrol, the own Border Patrol, your agents told us it would reduce the flow [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  by 70 percent almost overnight because the message would go out throughout the world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't waste your life savings on a cartel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=220.56s)]
*  They're not going to be able to get you over the line. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=222.52s)]
*  Stay where you are. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  Stay in Mexico. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Stay in a safe third country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  He won't do it, Sean. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  He told me that he didn't have the authority to do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=229.6s)]
*  I said, that's just simply not true. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=231.72s)]
*  President Trump did it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  Why can't you do it? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  He said, Oh, Mexico doesn't want that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, you're the president of the United States. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=236.56s)]
*  You should act like it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, in the first hundred days, he rescinded all the Trump policies that had actually secured [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  the border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=244.44s)]
*  And the result has been devastating to the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  We saw what happened to this nursing student in Georgia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this should not happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=251.72s)]
*  And my biggest fear is, you know, have terror cells because many of these illegal immigrants [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=255.12s)]
*  are unvetted from some of our top geopolitical foes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=260.0s)]
*  What do you think the odds are that there are terror cells that are in this country [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=263.6s)]
*  as a result of Joe Biden's policies plotting, planning and scheming another 9-11 or worse [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=268.2s)]
*  against the American people? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=274.76s)]
*  I'd say the odds are 100 percent, but I pray to God I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=276.08s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=281.64s)]
*  This is a very, very dangerous time, and we've allowed that to continue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=282.96s)]
*  You've got, I think there may be 15 million illegals who have come across that border [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=286.44s)]
*  since Joe Biden took office. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=290.44s)]
*  You know, President Trump had such a, there was such a distinction between these two leaders. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=292.08s)]
*  You know, he built the wall. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=295.96s)]
*  He deported criminals and he seized fentanyl. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=297.84s)]
*  Joe Biden has done exactly the opposite of all of it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  We see the effects and America can't stand for this any longer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, give you a lot of credit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=305.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm not sure how well I would do in a meeting with Joe Biden, the Vice President Harris, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=309.16s)]
*  Chuckie Schumer and Mitch McConnell. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  Not a great position to be in, but we will watch carefully. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  These are consequential times, Mr. Speaker. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=323.0s)]
*  We need leadership. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  We definitely need a united Republican party, something we discussed from day one. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate your time, sir. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6q9hsO59_0&t=330.44000000000005s)]
