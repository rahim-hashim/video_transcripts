# They know inflation is a killer: Peter Doocy
**Fox News:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE)
*  Anyway, here with reaction Fox News senior White House correspondent, our friend Peter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=0.0s)]
*  Ducey is here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=4.12s)]
*  All right, they seem pretty pissed off and offended to me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=5.12s)]
*  I mean, Kamala's praising Joe. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=8.16s)]
*  Joe says she won't distance herself. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=10.56s)]
*  KJP is saying that there's no daylight at all between their views. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Susan Rice finds it offensive, and she was an integral architect of this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=18.32s)]
*  So she seems to be distancing herself from my perspective. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=24.96s)]
*  And obviously, based on your questions, I would argue you think so, too. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=28.96s)]
*  Well, it seems like just based on what we are told and what we hear that President Biden, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=35.04s)]
*  when he agreed begrudgingly to leave the race and endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=41.6s)]
*  Remember, this time last month, there were some Democrats who wanted some kind of a mini [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=47.92s)]
*  primary where maybe some other ideas could organically get elected by delegates and a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=52.16s)]
*  different person or a different platform could rise up to the top and challenge Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  But it seems like when Biden said, I'll get out of the way and endorse Harris. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  But the condition is I am only going to support everything that I have been doing for the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=67.92s)]
*  last couple of years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=73.52s)]
*  And that's got to be the centerpiece of her platform, too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=74.72s)]
*  That's what we're hearing from all the hardcore Biden people, like the president himself, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=78.08s)]
*  obviously, but also the press secretary and Susan Rice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  But there's this great item in Axios yesterday that says the people in Wilmington don't want her tied [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  to this platform, especially economically, that was so unhelpful to President Biden that he had [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=92.32s)]
*  to drop out. They know that inflation is a killer, even in her first week of remarks on the campaign [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=98.32s)]
*  trail. We were there in Philly last Thursday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=104.72s)]
*  She's talking about how prices are still too high. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=107.04s)]
*  But it's got to be this this balancing act of I'm going to do something different. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=110.4s)]
*  But also in the job that I have right now, I don't want to offend my boss, who I still probably do [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=115.84s)]
*  need to help me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=123.44s)]
*  And in that clip that you played from Prince George's County today, just to kind of put a bow [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  on all that, when she was saluting President Biden and saying there's a lot of love in this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=129.44s)]
*  room, he was standing off to the side. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=133.92s)]
*  And I think the best way that I would describe the way that he looked is wistful. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  It didn't seem like a joyous passing of the torch. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  It seemed like he was just standing there and he knows for the first time on stage that this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=145.76s)]
*  today is the beginning of the end of him as president and of his ideas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  And he can say that she is not going to distance herself from his economic policies, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  all that he wants. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  But she's unveiling an economic plan tomorrow and it's all stuff that's different. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=164.0s)]
*  But she was recently praising Bidenomics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=168.72s)]
*  She went along for three years with the lie that that inflation's transitory. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  She went along for three plus years with the lie that the border's secure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, she is backing away from her. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  I'll use the filibuster, eliminate the filibuster to pass the 93 trillion dollar [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=183.44s)]
*  green new deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=188.08s)]
*  ICE was compared to the KKK and she wanted to rethink ICE. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=189.28s)]
*  Now she wants to fund them against fracking, against drilling, wanted to defund, dismantle, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  no bail laws. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  Of course, she was the vote that was the tipping point as it relates to taxing tips [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  in the Inflation Reduction Act, the opposite of what she's saying now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=208.8s)]
*  She wanted Medicare for all, universal healthcare, eliminating private healthcare. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  Of course, on the borders, decriminalize open borders. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=217.84s)]
*  You heard the cut we played earlier. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=223.68s)]
*  The wall was a vanity project of Donald Trump's because he thinks that terrorists might invade [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=225.84s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=231.28s)]
*  Well, Peter, terrorists are in the country, as what Congress is telling us. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=232.48s)]
*  The last time that she was a candidate advocating for herself, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=239.44s)]
*  she just needed to win progressive Democrats. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=242.8s)]
*  I spent weeks of my life chasing her around the halls of Capitol Hill in 2019 and the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=245.2s)]
*  beginning of 2020, at a time when she was rated just objectively by, I believe it's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=251.28s)]
*  PolitiFact, the most liberal senator. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  We would hear Bernie Sanders or Warren, who were also running, put something out and then [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=261.52s)]
*  she would come up with something that was, at the time, more progressive. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Now she's not just competing for, she still needs those progressive Democrats, but she [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=268.48s)]
*  also needs a bunch of people in the middle who have become, in the last couple months, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=273.68s)]
*  frustrated with Biden. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=279.44s)]
*  Trump curious again. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=280.96s)]
*  She needs all of these people and she has not, at this point, articulated what changed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=282.24s)]
*  Right now, they are doing what I think they watched, like six weeks ago, Donald Trump, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=290.16s)]
*  when he just kind of stayed back and, you know, he kept as quiet as possible for as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=296.64s)]
*  long as possible before their convention. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=302.72s)]
*  It seems like that is what they're trying to do with her, but it is not something that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  they're going to be able to do forever. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  All right, Peter Ducey, great job. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=312.24s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2PMDiwkNE&t=313.36s)]
