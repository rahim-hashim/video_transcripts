# This Trump judge has clear ‘political motivations’: Alina Habba
**Fox News:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q)
*  A spokesperson, Alina Habes, she was in the courtroom today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Sounds like the judge is serious, Alina, and it sounds like the double standard has gotten [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=4.92s)]
*  worse. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It has. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  It has, Sean. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  There's no other way of saying it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  We've seen it time and time again, as you're seeing with the comments that you've made. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  We've got witnesses that are allowed to talk and go on MSNBC or MSDNC, as my client likes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=18.76s)]
*  to call it, CNN, and talk about my client, talk about this case, but for some reason [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=24.96s)]
*  he can't talk. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=29.28s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=30.44s)]
*  And then you layer that with a judge who has clear ambitions and political motivations. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=31.44s)]
*  He's threatening to throw a former president, as he acknowledged most importantly today [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=37.88s)]
*  in the courtroom while I was there, this is probably going to be the future president. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=42.54s)]
*  And for somebody who's left wing to say that was shocking, but he did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  And he recognized it and then threatened to put him in jail for speaking. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  He didn't even speak, frankly, Sean. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  He re-posted things that other people said and that in itself he called contempt. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=57.66s)]
*  We are looking at a serious dual system of justice. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=64.16s)]
*  We are in a state of crisis when it comes to our judicial system. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=66.82s)]
*  This is election interference so that he cannot campaign because Biden cannot win if he doesn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=70.22s)]
*  hold him in court. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=75.5s)]
*  Yeah, pretty amazing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=77.66s)]
*  Alina, we're watching this all unfold before our eyes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=79.58s)]
*  I feel like we're living in a third world country and this is a kangaroo court. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  Sad times for our country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=87.34s)]
*  We'll be watching closely in the days to come. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  Alina, thank you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03UyOu_g4Q&t=90.86s)]
