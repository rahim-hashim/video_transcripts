# Sean Hannity: Harris' record is so left-wing that she has to hide her positions from Americans
**Fox News:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY)
*  And welcome to Hannity. After a second assassination attempt on President Trump, the Secret Service [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=0.0s)]
*  finally gave an update on the failures at the Butler rally back in July, the site of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=7.58s)]
*  the first assassination attempt. We'll have more on that coming up later. But first, our [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=12.92s)]
*  country is at a tipping point. This is an inflection point for the USA. We are now only [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=17.28s)]
*  46 days away from the most consequential election in our lifetime, mail-in voting. It is already [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=23.96s)]
*  underway in several states across the country. And today, early in-person voting began in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=31.16s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia, where a brand new poll, by the way, released this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=37.24s)]
*  It shows the race is a statistical tie. Look at that. At this moment, at least. Now, Trump [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=41.7s)]
*  is polling far ahead of where he was at this point in the 2020 election, across several [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=47.8s)]
*  key battleground states. Let's take a look. In Pennsylvania, for example, which could [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=53.38s)]
*  be the state that decides the election, and early voting is happening now, Trump is polling [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  three points ahead of where he was at this point in 2020. He did not lose the state by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=63.7s)]
*  a lot. In Wisconsin, President Trump is currently five and a half points ahead of where he was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  on this day in 2020. In Michigan, he is polling over five points ahead of where he was in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=75.58s)]
*  2020. So why are his poll numbers better this time around? Now, maybe because millions of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=82.02s)]
*  voters around the country, to them, well, Kamala Harris's positions are still a mystery. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=89.02s)]
*  And if you're knowledgeable, you know they are radical, they are extreme, and frankly, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=95.78s)]
*  dangerous for the country economically and dangerous on the national security front. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=100.62s)]
*  Look at her position on the border. Look at her position on Iran and some of these other [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=106.16s)]
*  countries. Her record is so left-wing that she has to hide her real positions from all [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=111.26s)]
*  of you. And so far, with the help of the corrupt state-run media mob, she's been successful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=116.74s)]
*  But make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the most radical candidate this country has ever [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=123.18s)]
*  had at the top of a major party ticket. And all of you, this country deserves answers [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=128.78s)]
*  to what our growing list of questions. We have been putting these positions forward [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=136.58s)]
*  now for two months. Her positions on nearly every single solitary important issue of our [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=142.02s)]
*  time has changed without explanation. Does she still support the radical climate alarmist [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=148.62s)]
*  religious cult and their $93 trillion Green New Deal? Why did she co-sponsor that in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=154.38s)]
*  U.S. Senate with Bernie Sanders? Why did she co-sponsor Government and Health Care for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=160.46s)]
*  All and the elimination of private health insurance? Does she still think it is courageous [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=164.86s)]
*  not to use the term illegal alien or radical Islamic terrorism? And if she believes it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=170.98s)]
*  why? Does she still want to ban fracking, offshore drilling? What about the radical [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=176.94s)]
*  position on illegal immigration? Look at the position Harris and Biden have put this country [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=181.62s)]
*  in. You know, think about this. She wants to decriminalize illegal immigration. She [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=188.22s)]
*  wants a path to amnesty, right? Earned path to citizenship. She wants to offer free housing, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=192.66s)]
*  health care, education, sex change operations. And we have allowed into this country unvetted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=198.46s)]
*  illegal immigrants from 180 countries, including our top geopolitical foes and countries with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=205.34s)]
*  terror ties. They have been committing dozens of murders and rapes, even of young children [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=211.78s)]
*  and other violent crimes. And there have been absolutely no consequences at all whatsoever [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=217.98s)]
*  for the decisions that they have made. They have allowed this to happen. And Americans [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=224.54s)]
*  are getting hurt, never mind the cost, never mind the fentanyl, never mind, you know, the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=230.42s)]
*  hard drugs that are crossing into this country. And by the way, she sat down for an interview [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=235.06s)]
*  last month with CNN fake news's Dana Bash. And she said, quote, her values have not changed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=240.3s)]
*  She did a whopping 16 minute, 29 second interview. So why is she claiming her policy positions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=247.06s)]
*  have changed? And she's not even making the claim. She has campaign aides saying it for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=254.1s)]
*  her. Last night, she had a chance to clear up some of all of this. She had the softball [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=259.62s)]
*  of all softball interviews with Oprah. But as usual, she offered nothing more than a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  bunch of awkward word salads. And even Oprah couldn't save her from herself. Take a look [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  at some of the lowlights. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=274.94s)]
*  Let's come together with the character that we are so proud of about who we are, which [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=277.14s)]
*  is we are an optimistic people. We are an optimistic people. Americans by character [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=283.9s)]
*  are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations. We believe in what is possible. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=292.14s)]
*  We believe in what can be. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=301.3s)]
*  We really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=303.06s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, thank you both for being here. And yours is a story I hear around the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=308.06s)]
*  country as I travel. It's very important that we all speak to our friends and our neighbors [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=316.06s)]
*  about misinformation and help them now see how it occurs, where it is occurring. And [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=320.88s)]
*  so this is a moment where we stand knowing what we are fighting for. We're not fighting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=327.06s)]
*  against. It's what we're fighting for. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=332.38s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Madam Vice President. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=336.38s)]
*  Now, what she has said is she supports the largest tax increase in American and world [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=340.38s)]
*  history and the $93 trillion New Green Deal, which would end capitalism as we know it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=346.38s)]
*  That would be Marxism, if you want to look at an economic philosophy behind it. There [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=352.38s)]
*  was one moment last night in particular that made headlines when the two were discussing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=358.38s)]
*  gun control. You're not going to believe what Kamala said. Take a listen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=363.38s)]
*  I'm a gun owner. Tim Walz is a gun owner. I did not know that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=367.38s)]
*  And somebody breaks into my house to get a shot. Yes, yes. I hear that. I hear that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=371.38s)]
*  Probably should not have said that. My staff will deal with that later. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=378.38s)]
*  The giggling is not funny. Where does she stand on the Second Amendment and gun ownership? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=384.38s)]
*  Because for many years she has advocated for the most restrictive gun laws supporting [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=392.38s)]
*  a mandatory gun buyback. And by the way, what she said in that clip sounds an awful like [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=399.38s)]
*  a lot like stand your ground, the same stand your ground laws that she and Democrats have [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=406.38s)]
*  spent years demonizing. In case you forgot, let's take a look at her past radical stances [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=413.38s)]
*  on gun ownership. You decide. Assault weapons that are already in circulation, what do you [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=418.38s)]
*  do about those? Well, there are approximately five million to your point, Craig. We have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=423.38s)]
*  to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program. How mandatory is [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=427.38s)]
*  your gun buyback program? It's mandatory. Second Amendment? Second Amendment, listen, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=431.38s)]
*  we have to, we're going to have to do it the right way. There's no question about that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=437.38s)]
*  But we don't have, we have to get these guns off the street. And just because you legally [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=442.38s)]
*  possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=447.38s)]
*  walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=452.38s)]
*  conduct your affair. Mandatory gun buyback, that would be called confiscation and we can [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=456.38s)]
*  enter your home and we can check on your guns anytime we want. You deserve answers. But [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=462.38s)]
*  Kamala, her handlers, they're doing everything possible to hide her from the press. That [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=468.38s)]
*  was not a real interview last night. But finally, after nearly two months, she is now getting [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=474.38s)]
*  pushback on the strategy, even some on the left. You know, and by the way, take a look [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=479.38s)]
*  at what former Obama advisor David Axelrod had to say. Listen. I said years ago that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=484.38s)]
*  presidential races were MRIs for the soul and whoever you are, you know, people want, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=490.38s)]
*  they'll find out and they'll want to know. So one way you reveal that is through interviews [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=495.38s)]
*  and town halls and unscripted interactions. And I think she needs to do, I think she needs [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=502.38s)]
*  to do more of that between now and the election to give people comfort. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=508.38s)]
*  Well, the problem is she can't do it and her team knows she can't do it. And it's not like [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=513.38s)]
*  a debate where she's going to memorize her lines and just like a robot, recite them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=518.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, according to a new political report, Democrats are privately worried that the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=524.38s)]
*  Teamsters, Teamsters Union's shocking announcement this week that they would not endorse her. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=529.38s)]
*  This is the first time this union has not endorsed the Democrat for president since [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=536.38s)]
*  1996. That could be a major warning sign for her campaign. Now remember, a poll released [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=541.38s)]
*  by the union shows 60 percent of rank and file members. They want Donald Trump, only [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=547.38s)]
*  34 percent, Juan Camilo Harris. And by the way, the leadership of the Teamsters should [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=553.38s)]
*  have gone along with the rank and file. Well, they made it halfway. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDnmmcfkaY&t=559.38s)]
