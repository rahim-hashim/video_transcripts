# Judge's 'purely political' ruling gave Fani Willis a lifeline: Gregg Jarrett
**Fox News:** [March 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g)
*  All right. Joining us now with more reaction, Fox News contributor, Greg Jarrett and Harvard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=0.0s)]
*  law professor Alan Dershowitz is with us. Professor, start with you tonight. Odor of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=4.58s)]
*  mendacity. Let's get your take overall on the case and the lack of logic or the lack [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=10.06s)]
*  of the application to both Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade. That should have at least been [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=17.32s)]
*  consistent because they were both involved in it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=22.94s)]
*  Look, there's no odor here. There is perjury on the witness stand without a doubt. There [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=25.68s)]
*  are people in prison, people on death row on lower levels of evidence than this. What [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  the judge tried to do was be Solomon and split the baby and the baby died. This is a terrible, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=37.48s)]
*  terrible opinion. On the one hand, he says, I have a reasonable basis for wondering if [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=43.92s)]
*  the testimony is truthful. Then he proceeds to credit it and believe it when it comes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=48.4s)]
*  to whether she paid the money back, whether or not they had the affair, all of that kind [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=54.32s)]
*  of thing. This case belongs in front of a justice department or a an attorney general [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=59.28s)]
*  or a district attorney for a criminal prosecution. There was perjury, obstruction of justice, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  witness tampering and conspiracy to commit perjury. This is not a close case. There was, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=71.8s)]
*  of course, a real conflict of interest. No, maybe the prosecution didn't begin in order [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=77.72s)]
*  to enrich either of these two people. But along the way, decisions were made which enriched [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=83.56s)]
*  them and which may very well have impacted on the rights of defendants. This judge should [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  have dismissed her, dismissed the whole office and seriously considered dismissing the entire [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  case. And I think the lawyers for Trump, if they can, should try to take an interlocutory [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  appeal or a mandamus, some kind of an immediate appeal to the next level court. If they don't, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=108.2s)]
*  they will still have a good issue on appeal if they lose the, if they are convicted. This [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=114.36s)]
*  case is a disaster and this judge just didn't have the courage of his convictions. He knew [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=120.24s)]
*  that they lied, but he just didn't have the guts to say it directly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=126.36s)]
*  Well, he's running for reelection, Professor, and the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, launched [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=130.0s)]
*  the state commission with the power to remove rogue and incompetent prosecutors just like [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  her, which I imagine would happen here. Let's get your take, Greg Jarrett. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=139.68s)]
*  Well, the decision makes no sense, quite obviously, because the judge found that both Willis and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=146.68s)]
*  Wade engaged in improper conduct that merits removal for the appearance of impropriety. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=153.24s)]
*  The standard. But he also found that together they committed the exact same wrongful behavior. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=160.36s)]
*  So both of them are guilty of disqualifying conduct under the law. And yet he orders that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=167.8s)]
*  only one of them must leave the case. How is that remotely logical? Well, it's not, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=174.3s)]
*  which suggests, Sean, that this is a purely political ruling for the bench. I think it's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=180.88s)]
*  a craving, gutless decision to throw Fannie Willis a lifeline to keep the case against [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=186.48s)]
*  Trump going, because if she goes, then under Georgia rules and procedures, the entire indictment [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=192.04s)]
*  gets yanked from the DA's office. Willis gets to stay, but I don't know how in the world [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=197.92s)]
*  she survives this politically. I don't know how she survives the myriad of other investigations [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=205.0s)]
*  into her alleged wrongdoing or, in fact, her upcoming election. This judge condemned Willis [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=213.0s)]
*  for playing the race card in her church speech. Judge Janine is right. That's disqualification [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=220.12s)]
*  by itself. He openly admits that the case has, as you point out, the odor of mendacity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=226.24s)]
*  That means it's dishonest. And yet he refuses to fix it. His only remedy is partial. That's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=232.44s)]
*  no remedy at all. Look, let's be clear what really happened here. Let's be clear what [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=240.16s)]
*  really happened here. The judge started out with a conclusion that he was not going to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=244.92s)]
*  get rid of her. And then he had to wiggle his way around to find a basis for being able [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=250.12s)]
*  to condemn her, because he saw it all with his own eyes, but in a way that didn't result [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=256.12s)]
*  in her leaving. It was a very result-oriented, but he felt bad about it, so he had to condemn [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=261.48s)]
*  her and say some things about her. But bottom line is, he made up his mind right in the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=266.88s)]
*  beginning he was not going to disqualify her. Everything else was a variable. That was the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=271.56s)]
*  constant. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=275.88s)]
*  Well, let me ask you both this question, because the judge did poison the well against her, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  especially on appeal. It's hard to imagine one party created the conflict and benefited [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  from this and not the other. On the issue of alleged perjury, I would agree with your [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=286.84s)]
*  analysis, Professor. Then you have the whole issue of the fruit of the poison tree. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=292.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=297.88s)]
*  Greg, what about all the evidence that was accumulated by Nathan Wade? Doesn't that now [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=298.88s)]
*  have to be dismissed? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=303.08s)]
*  Well, fruit of the poisonous tree generally is evidence obtained illegally, cannot be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=305.36s)]
*  used. Here, it's more of corrupt behavior that creates the appearance of impropriety [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  and actual impropriety itself. The judge refused to find that. McAfee said that Fonny [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=321.22s)]
*  Willis' testimony was unprofessional, and he actually said it may have been untruthful. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  But then he goes on to say, and I'm quoting here, not so incredible as to be inherently [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=335.06s)]
*  unbelievable. What the hell does that mean? That's word salad, and it's charitable at [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=340.94000000000005s)]
*  best. No sensible person was buying these vacuous excuses that Willis and Wade were [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=346.18s)]
*  peddling during the hearing, but the judge is her apologist now saying, well, she made [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=352.38s)]
*  bad choices and exhibited, and I'm quoting here again, a tremendous lapse in judgment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  All right, exit last question. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=364.94s)]
*  No, it was unethical. It was disqualifying. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=366.18s)]
*  Will this case move forward, or does this case die on the vine? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I hope it dies on the vines. That's where it belongs. It was never a good case. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=374.7s)]
*  I would hope that his lawyers can try to bring some kind of an appellate action which will [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=379.46s)]
*  delay. You know, everybody says Trump is trying to delay. It's the opposite. It's the prosecutors [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=384.46s)]
*  who are trying to rush this case to try to get the convictions, if they can, in jurisdictions [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=390.26s)]
*  like Fulton County and New York City and Washington, D.C., before the election, knowing that they [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=395.86s)]
*  may be overturned on appeal. So it's a rush to judgment by the prosecutors, and of course, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=401.56s)]
*  defense attorneys want to slow it down. I think this may prove fatal, ultimately, to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=407.64s)]
*  the case. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=413.96s)]
*  Greg, last word. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=415.68s)]
*  Well, I think the jurors are going to know that this case is absolutely riven with scandal [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=417.48s)]
*  and conflict of interest and is politically motivated. And I think this is going to make [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=426.36s)]
*  it a lot harder for the district attorney to obtain a conviction against Donald Trump. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=433.44s)]
*  I agree. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  Listen, I lived in Georgia, Fulton County, Georgia. Not friendly territory for anybody [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  that is Republican or conservative or that has the last name Trump. We'll watch closely. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=445.16s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97MWd9cbU4g&t=451.68s)]
