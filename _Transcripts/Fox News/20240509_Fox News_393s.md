# Lindsey Graham: This is 'heartbreaking' news
**Fox News:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y)
*  Here with reaction is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, your reaction to this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Well, that was well done, Sean. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=5.76s)]
*  Heartbroken in a way, because I know in Jerusalem tonight they're trying to figure out what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=8.76s)]
*  do we do. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=14.08s)]
*  The only reason they're not dancing in Iran is because they don't believe in dancing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=15.68s)]
*  If you're send war in the tunnel, this is a good moment for you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=20.28s)]
*  But what does this mean to America? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=23.88s)]
*  It changes the game in all the worst ways in the war on terror. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  Here's what Joe Biden is asking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=29.68s)]
*  He's asking the Israelis to turn the war over to him and Lloyd Austin. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=31.68s)]
*  To my friends in Israel, don't do that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=36.12s)]
*  Fight without the weapons. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=39.04s)]
*  Do not let Joe Biden and Lloyd Austin run this war. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=40.32s)]
*  They will do for you what they've done for America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=43.92s)]
*  So my fear is that the hostage deal was hard. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=46.76s)]
*  Now it's impossible. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=50.04s)]
*  My fear is that Saudi Arabia that was thinking about recognizing Israel, now have been working [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=51.28s)]
*  with the Biden administration for a year to bring that deal about. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=56.06s)]
*  They would have a hard time right now if this continues, signing up with a defense agreement [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=59.42s)]
*  with Joe Biden and his team. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=64.98s)]
*  Who in their right mind in Saudi Arabia would turn their national security over to Joe Biden? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=67.22s)]
*  So this is heartbreaking, it's dangerous, it's pouring gasoline on a fire. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=73.12s)]
*  And every problem we had in the Mideast just got worse. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  This is a nightmare for Israel to be abandoned by their best friend in the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=82.12s)]
*  And the only way you're going to change this is at the ballot box in November. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=86.64s)]
*  You know, I don't know what this means for Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=91.12s)]
*  I don't know what it means for every country in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  I mean, look at what he's already done with Iran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Not only did he turn a blind eye to sanctions and allow the Iranians to sell oil and get [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  rich, you know, what, $100 billion plus? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  He was importing oil since March of 21 from Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=109.5s)]
*  He allowed, he gave a waiver to Iraq to give the mullahs $10 billion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=112.94s)]
*  He wanted to give them $6 billion in a ransom exchange. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=117.62s)]
*  What part of Iran being the world's number one state sponsor of terror is he not understanding? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=121.64s)]
*  And what part of what happened to Israel on October 7th is he not understanding here? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=127.66s)]
*  No, I think he does, I think he doesn't understand, and that's the problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  October the 7th was the largest loss of life of Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=137.26s)]
*  They're surrounded by Iran, who wants to wipe out the Jewish state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=142.82s)]
*  Hamas says they will do it again and again and again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=146.86s)]
*  Their charter is to destroy Israel, not to help the Palestinians. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=149.66s)]
*  Then you got Hezbollah with 100,000 rockets pointed at Israel from Lebanon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=153.42s)]
*  They're surrounded by radical Islamic terrorists that want to destroy the Jewish state, not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=157.66s)]
*  help the Palestinians. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=162.66s)]
*  And what is Joe Biden's response to withhold weapons in a war that Israel cannot afford [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  to lose? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  What did we do after we were attacked in Pearl Harbor? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  What did we do to end the war against the Japanese? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=173.98s)]
*  We dropped two nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities to make sure our soldiers didn't have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=177.04s)]
*  to invade Japan, where you could have a million lives lost. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=182.14s)]
*  What is Joe Biden doing? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=185.5s)]
*  He's making it impossible for allies throughout the world to trust us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  He's making it hard on Israel to win. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  Senator, this would be the equivalent of losing 40,000 Americans a day if you extrapolate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=193.78s)]
*  and compare their population to ours and 8,000 Americans taking off American soil and taking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=199.3s)]
*  hostage. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=204.94s)]
*  Let me play your exchange on this very issue you were speaking to with the Secretary of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=206.2s)]
*  Defense, Secretary Austin. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=211.26s)]
*  And you're telling me you're going to tell them how to fight the war and what they can [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=213.86s)]
*  and can't use when everybody around them wants to kill all the Jews? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=220.02s)]
*  And you're telling me that if we withhold weapons in this fight, the existential fight [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=225.22s)]
*  for the life of the Jewish state, it won't send the wrong signal? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=231.44s)]
*  Do you still think it was a good idea, General Austin, to get out of Afghanistan? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=235.06s)]
*  I support the President's decision. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  I think you do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=241.62s)]
*  I think it was a disastrous decision. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=242.74s)]
*  If we stop weapons necessary to destroy the enemies of the state of Israel at a time of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=245.3s)]
*  great peril, we will pay a price. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  This is obscene. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=254.86s)]
*  It is absurd. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=256.14s)]
*  Give Israel what they need to fight the war they can't afford to lose. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=257.68s)]
*  If they are ever successful—that was a great exchange, Senator. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  Then you brought up the issue of, you know, should we use—what are we wrong to use atomic [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  weapons to end World War II? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=272.02s)]
*  What was his answer? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=275.34s)]
*  It was a delayed answer. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=277.26s)]
*  I asked General Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, if you were around in World [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=279.38s)]
*  War II, would you advise dropping the atomic bomb to end the war? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=282.78s)]
*  He finally said, well, you know, it did end the war. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=286.46s)]
*  You got to realize that Israel's in a fight for its life. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=289.0s)]
*  This is not some normal exchange in the Mideast. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=292.3s)]
*  They want to kill the Jewish state, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=295.26s)]
*  And what did they do? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=298.58s)]
*  They put command centers under hospitals. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=299.74s)]
*  They hide weapons in mosques and schools. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=303.74s)]
*  They use human shields to make it hard for Israel to kill the terrorists without killing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=306.64s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel is in a terrible spot because they're fighting a vicious enemy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=313.22s)]
*  And Joe Biden today, you picked Michigan over Mideast stability. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=316.94s)]
*  You picked domestic politics over world stability. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=324.68s)]
*  What you did tonight, my friend, is that you made every terrorist in the world Hezikite. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=328.62s)]
*  You put our friends in Israel in a box. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=334.62s)]
*  And here's what they're going to do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=336.5s)]
*  Here's what I would do if I was Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=338.3s)]
*  I'd say I appreciate all the support in the past. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=339.82s)]
*  We're going to do what we have to do to destroy Hamas. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=342.26s)]
*  We're not going to turn the war over to Lord Austin, who thought it was a good idea [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=345.98s)]
*  to get out of Afghanistan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=349.66s)]
*  It'd be like asking me, Orcas, could you help us secure our border? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=350.9s)]
*  To my friends in Israel, do what you have to do. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=354.5s)]
*  Destroy these battalions and don't let Joe Biden give a win to the terrorists. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=357.84s)]
*  You know what? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=363.18s)]
*  They're going to win the war without Joe Biden. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=364.18s)]
*  They're going to win the war without Joe Biden. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=365.9s)]
*  Yes, they got the yes, they will. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=367.94s)]
*  And it's sad because if they were ever successful in destroying Israel as their charter calls [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=370.62s)]
*  for, we're next. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=375.74s)]
*  That I can promise every American. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=377.94s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=379.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=380.82s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=381.82s)]
