# Sean Hannity: President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have blood on their hands
**Fox News:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM)
*  First, just moments ago, more than three days after dropping out of the 2024 presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=0.0s)]
*  race, Joe Biden finally explained his decision in a very short 12-minute speech, mumbling, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=4.96s)]
*  bumbling, stumbling, bumbling, frankly, to the American people, one that clearly showed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=11.92s)]
*  his cognitive decline that was covered up by those around him and the state-run media mob. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=17.76s)]
*  It was on full display, basically, an average day. Take a look. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=23.04s)]
*  You know, in recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=28.0s)]
*  critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=33.68s)]
*  my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=41.28s)]
*  in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  Oh, democracy in peril, the same party that wanted to keep Donald Trump off the ballot, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=61.28s)]
*  the same party that disenfranchised millions and millions of their own primary voters. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=66.0s)]
*  He's dropping out to save democracy. What about those disenfranchised Democrats? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=72.24s)]
*  All of their primary votes tossed in the garbage. And by the way, Joe Biden can barely talk, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=77.92s)]
*  but Democrats, the state-run media mob, they now want you to believe that Joe Biden [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  is too far gone for a political campaign, but he can somehow still carry out his duties as president [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=90.08s)]
*  for another six months. He looked as usual, weak, frail, and a cognitive mess. We told you this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  before the 2020 election. Now, these are the same people only a few weeks ago that told you that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=103.44s)]
*  Biden was sharp as a tack and videos that we showed you that were unedited of his decline. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=109.36s)]
*  They were cheap fake videos. The same people who now want you to believe that Kamala Harris [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=115.2s)]
*  is the second coming of Jesus. We're now less than a week into Kamala's ascension as her party's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=121.2s)]
*  presidential nominee. The honeymoon phase, you know, the sugar high is fully underway. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And breaking tonight, Democrats just finalized a plan to nominate Harris before the convention [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=132.48s)]
*  to prevent any debate or competition. And meanwhile, the state-run media mob, they now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  gushing over Harris, scrubbing her radical record, and they now claim that the real [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  border czar was never really the border czar. And just yesterday, the supposedly nonpartisan [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=149.6s)]
*  gov track, oh, they deleted this very important report, a report that ranked Kamala as the most [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=155.76s)]
*  left-wing senator in 2019. She was left of Bernie Sanders, the socialist from Vermont. But tonight, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=163.12s)]
*  it's pretty easy to cut through all the clutter, all the lies, all the propaganda. In between, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  plenty of weird and nervous giggling from Kamala Harris. There is something called her radical and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  extreme record. And these radical beliefs, we have a lot of them on camera. And tonight, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=182.4s)]
*  we continue to do the job of the media mob and bring you Kamala, Kamala in her own words. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  And we begin with her 2019 Senate voting record that, yeah, was to the left of Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. You're considered the most liberal United States senator. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=201.28s)]
*  I, somebody said that and it actually was Mike Pence on the debate stage. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=205.52s)]
*  But yeah, well, actually the nonpartisan gov track has rated you as the most liberal senator. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=211.52s)]
*  You supported the Green New Deal. You supported Medicare for all. You've supported legalizing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=219.36s)]
*  marijuana. Joe Biden doesn't support those things. So are you going to bring the policies, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  those progressive policies that you supported as senator into a Biden administration? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  What I will do, and I promise you this, and this is what Joe wants me to do. This was part of our [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=235.52s)]
*  deal. I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  confront. I'm the most liberal senator ever. I don't know what to say. Compiling a voting record [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=247.52s)]
*  even more liberal than, yep, Bernie Sanders. That's not easy to do. That's a big accomplishment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=256.08s)]
*  But Kamala, she pulled it off and then touted this record during her last run for president. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=261.12s)]
*  Let's take a look, shall we, in her own words? Plastic straws are a big thing right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=266.72s)]
*  Yeah. Do you ban plastic straws? I think we should. Yes. I think there's no question that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=270.8s)]
*  we've got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way that it is being administered [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=276.0s)]
*  and the work it is doing. So would you ban offshore drilling? Yes. And I've again worked on that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=281.36s)]
*  Raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=286.0s)]
*  without documentation. Can we keep the hands up so we could see them? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=293.44s)]
*  Back to the United States Congress, here's my point. If they fail to act as president of the United [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=299.04s)]
*  States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I am in favor of saying [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=304.72s)]
*  that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented across the border as criminals. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=312.0s)]
*  That's correct. That is correct. Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=315.76s)]
*  first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  devastating practice? There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. For far too long, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=325.44s)]
*  the status quo thinking has been to believe that by putting more police on the street, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=329.76s)]
*  you're going to have more safety. And that's just wrong. But would you support changing the dietary [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=335.12s)]
*  guidelines? Yes. You know, the food pyramid. Yes. But people are like, reduce red meat specifically. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=339.28s)]
*  Yes, I would. The bill also says, quote, every individual who is a resident of the United States [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=343.92s)]
*  is entitled to benefits for health care services under this act. Not every individual who's a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  citizen, but every individual who's a resident. So you support giving universal health care, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=353.6s)]
*  Medicare for all to people who are in this country illegally? Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=359.6s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=364.8s)]
*  to public safety, public education, or public health, period. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=372.0s)]
*  All right. Let me see. No fracking. Wait a minute. No drilling. No straws. Let's see. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=379.12s)]
*  Less consumption of beef. But you get free health care and free education if you're an illegal [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=386.56s)]
*  immigrant. And no restrictions at all on abortion. Let's be clear. These just are not pie in the sky [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=391.44s)]
*  ideas. This is who she is. During her time in the Senate, she actually co-sponsored legislation [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=398.08s)]
*  to ban offshore drilling. She co-sponsored, yep, the Green New Deal, which is a multi-trillion [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=403.52s)]
*  dollar socialist wish list that bans fossil fuels, upends property rights, and empowers the federal [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=409.84s)]
*  government to control the means of production. But that's not all. Kamala also co-sponsored that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=417.12s)]
*  Medicare for All bill with her good friend Bernie Sanders. In other words, a single-payer socialized [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=422.96s)]
*  medical system in this country that you'd have to join. This truly insane legislation would strip [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=429.52s)]
*  health insurance from all Americans. It throws everyone into a public welfare system run by this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=435.52s)]
*  corrupt government. And of course, the salaries of doctors, nurses, other medical professionals [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  would be set by what? Federal bureaucrats, hospitals, doctors' offices would be run like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=447.52s)]
*  what? The post office? They're doing so well there. But don't take my word for it. Let's go back to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=453.04s)]
*  Kamala in her own words. Take a listen. You support the Medicare for All bill, I think, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. You're also a co-sponsor on it. I believe it will [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  totally eliminate private insurance. So for people out there who like their insurance, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=468.56s)]
*  they don't get to keep it? Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=480.08s)]
*  give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=484.8s)]
*  not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, I don't [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=489.6s)]
*  know if your insurance company is going to cover this. Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=493.52s)]
*  You know, the media mob that covered up for Joe Biden's cognitive decline for over four years, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=498.08s)]
*  and they lied about it and covered it all up. Do you think they're going to ask her about these [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=505.12s)]
*  comments? Medicare for All? That's not exactly cheap. So naturally, Vice President Harris thinks [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=510.4s)]
*  70 to 80 percent tax rate proposed by AOC is fantastic. Again, Kamala in her own words. Take [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  a listen. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=526.72s)]
*  followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=532.0s)]
*  and she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  every car should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=540.64s)]
*  rate. Do you agree that she could possibly in this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  party? No, you know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=550.72s)]
*  I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=559.44s)]
*  Now, don't forget under Kamala Harris, a chunk of your tax dollars won't even be spent on you, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=566.48s)]
*  the American people. Biden's border czar, although she is distancing herself from that position, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=571.76s)]
*  has long advocated for an open border and she believes you, everyone watching, the American [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=577.92s)]
*  people, should be paying for health care, housing and every other living expense for anybody and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=584.16s)]
*  everybody who crosses our border illegally. In fact, she believes that illegal immigration [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=589.76s)]
*  should not even be considered a crime. Kamala in her own words. As a prosecutor, I can tell you [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  it is a serious mistake to conflate criminal justice policy with immigration policy as if [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=603.2s)]
*  they are the same thing. They are not. I have personally prosecuted everything from low-level [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  offenses to homicides. I know what a crime looks like and I will tell you an undocumented immigrant [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  is not a criminal. All right, this must be a joke, right? No, it's not. The person in charge of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  solving the root cause of our border crisis for the last three years doesn't even think illegal [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=632.0s)]
*  immigration is a crime. Not too surprising since she never went to where the border troubles were [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=636.96s)]
*  taking place. Remember, she had one trip that was even near the border but nowhere where the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=642.48s)]
*  trouble was at the border. It's no wonder the border is an unmitigated disaster, our number one [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=647.44s)]
*  national security threat. And by the way, as I said last night, Joe and Kamala Harris, for every [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=652.8s)]
*  rape, for every murder, and if there's another 9-11, they have blood on their hands. Now, of course, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=658.4s)]
*  Kamala also plays a key role in America's violent crime crisis. According to your vice president, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=664.64s)]
*  America is safer with fewer police and fewer violent offenders in jail. Remember, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=670.8s)]
*  she helped raise money for that bail fund that freed rapists and murderers. And it's pretty [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=676.24s)]
*  safe to say that Kamala was also a big supporter of the 574 riots, violent riots in the summer of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=681.36s)]
*  2020 that they said were mostly peaceful. Now, that looked like an insurrection to me. In fact, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=688.64s)]
*  she encouraged the rioters to keep it up. Remember, a month after they burned a police station, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=694.08s)]
*  a precinct to the ground. Four days after, she supported the bail fund. That bail fund raised [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=700.16s)]
*  that next year from, it went from a quarter of a million dollars to over 40. But that was four [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=705.44s)]
*  days after. A month after, they're not going to stop. They shouldn't stop. We're not going to stop. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=710.56s)]
*  Why would they stop rioting? Take a look. This is a movement, I'm telling you. They're not going to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  stop. And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop. They're not going to stop before [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day. And that should be, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=727.52s)]
*  everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, they're not going to let up, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=732.0s)]
*  and they should not. Beware. Take note. They're not going to stop rioting. And while Kamala applauded [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=736.64s)]
*  the violent behavior from criminals and agitators, she's dead set on taking guns away from [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  all of you peaceful, law-abiding American citizens. In her own words, you decide. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=750.64s)]
*  What would you do about the millions of specifically assault weapons that are already [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=757.76s)]
*  in circulation? What do you do about those? Well, there are approximately five million, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=764.96s)]
*  to your point, Craig. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  It's got to be smart. We've got to do it the right way. Now, as most of you know, the term mandatory [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  gun buyback, that's liberal leftist speak for gun confiscation. Kamala Harris wants your federal [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  government to take your firearms by force and then drop off a check for your troubles. But Kamala [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=785.44s)]
*  doesn't just want to take away your right to self-defense and your money and, of course, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=791.12s)]
*  you know, defund, dismantle, no bail laws. Also, your private insurance. She wants to upend your [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=795.68s)]
*  freedom of speech. She has long called on tech companies and tech giants to censor so-called [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=801.84s)]
*  hate speech, in other words, speech she doesn't like, and punish those that she finds disagreeable. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=808.24s)]
*  But, of course, none of this would apply to Kamala. Here she is giggling, laughing, joking [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=814.4s)]
*  about actually killing Donald Trump, in her own words. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=825.76s)]
*  Does one of us have to come out alive? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=833.76s)]
*  You're giggling, Vice President. Is this really the best that the Democratic Party can do? Maybe if the DNC [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=841.76s)]
*  actually listened to the voters and had a real election and let the voters decide and not [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=850.16s)]
*  disenfranchise them and throw their votes in the garbage, the party's nominee, you know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=856.08s)]
*  you know, it might be somebody more capable, less radical. Maybe they'd be the nominee. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=861.76s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, it's not just Kamala's radical track record that is concerning. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=867.12s)]
*  Like Biden, Kamala Harris also struggles with very basic tasks, like knowing the difference between [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=872.0s)]
*  North Korea and South Korea. Now, she does know, well, Ukraine is a country. It's next to a bigger [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=878.96s)]
*  country called Russia. We know that part. She doesn't know the South and North Korea part, in her own words. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=886.72s)]
*  So the United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=893.6s)]
*  Republic of North Korea, and it is an alliance that is strong and enduring. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=900.72s)]
*  And today there were several demonstrations of just that point. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=907.68s)]
*  And according to reports, Kamala is notorious for not putting in the work. Apparently, she did not [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=914.08s)]
*  like to read briefings, often fails to prepare for big events, and as Vice President, her office was [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=918.72s)]
*  a complete train wreck. The staff turnover rate, get this, was higher than 90 percent, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=925.6s)]
*  reportedly due to a toxic and disorganized work environment, and it doesn't help that Kamala [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=931.44s)]
*  Harris trashed young staffers in public, in her own words. What's the other thing we know about [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=936.96s)]
*  this population, and it's a specific phase of life? Remember, age is more than a chronological [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=944.32s)]
*  fact. What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=948.72s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=957.28s)]
*  decisions. If you're 18 to 24, that's a friendly reminder. You're stupid, and that's why they put [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  you in dorms with resident advisors. Kamala Harris thinks you're stupid. All those young people, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=975.44s)]
*  you're going to vote for her? You're stupid. That's what she thinks, not what I think. In fact, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=983.0400000000001s)]
*  she seems to think most Americans are stupid and need the government to control every aspect of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=988.4000000000001s)]
*  their lives. But when the current sugar high and the honeymoon phase surrounding Kamala's coronation [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=993.7600000000001s)]
*  is over, can she actually win the election? Obama doesn't seem to think so. Look at this report out [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=1000.16s)]
*  tonight from the New York Post that the former president does not believe that Kamala Harris [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=1006.88s)]
*  can beat Donald Trump, which is why he has not endorsed her. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6EzzeAeqTM&t=1011.68s)]
