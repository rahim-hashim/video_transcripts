*  No, here's the deal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=109.60000000000001s)]

*  Kamala is attempting to create a political illusion and it's based on a big lie all while her policy positions [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=131.28s)]
*  They're not even listed on her website and try as she may the vice president just cannot seem to shake her radical instincts [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=138.04s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. Now. This is what grocery shopping look like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=145.96s)]
*  With price controls, that's the former Soviet Union [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember they were waiting for bread and bread lines and toilet paper and empty shells and hungry people with sunken eyes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=153.44s)]
*  Here is the cold hard simple truth farmers suppliers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=160.16s)]
*  Distributors other businesses do not operate at a loss that is not capitalism [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=165.32s)]
*  They either eventually go out of business or they move to another country and the supply chain in the country where they're having those things [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=171.24s)]
*  dries up [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  But when the Soviet Union got rid of price controls and let the market determine the cost well food returned to the shelves the bread [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=180.08s)]
*  Lines disappeared now if she goes the route of weaponizing the DOJ to go after food companies and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Manufacturers think for a second. Who do you what do you think? They're going to have to do they will hire lawyers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=194.5s)]
*  They're not gonna hire cheap lawyers. They're gonna hire lawyers from the top law firms in the country [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=201.74s)]
*  They're very expensive and they will spend millions and millions of dollars defending themselves and likely they're going to win and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=206.42s)]
*  Guess who's going to pay for the lawyers? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=214.06s)]
*  Consumers you will in the form of higher prices [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  But sadly no one in the Harris campaign seems to understand history or economics now tomorrow [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=219.98s)]
*  Kamala is announcing a proposal to go after grocery stores for quote price [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=225.94s)]

*  Marxism socialism statism. I don't know [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=243.18s)]
*  Basically communism and I'll let this be a warning [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=246.7s)]
*  Kamala is either the single most radical person ever run for president of our country or she's the dumbest person in politics [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=249.7s)]
*  We'll let you decide either way if all Americans I am convinced if they fully [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=256.82s)]
*  Understand the scope of her radical extreme dangerous [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=262.78s)]

*  they they did interviews with 1200 Democrats and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=279.58s)]
*  Independent Biden voters the vast majority are almost completely unaware of any of her real very real [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=283.94s)]

*  early in the administration [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  She was supposed to find the root cause of mass illegal immigration and she was given the task to fix the crisis [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=369.9s)]
*  That obviously never happened [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=377.74s)]
*  In fact the crisis only got worse in the past three years more than what 11 million unvetted Biden Harris [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=379.54s)]
*  illegal immigrants have entered our country from all over the world 180 countries including Iran and let's see Syria and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=385.86s)]

*  Vanity project take a look [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=411.02s)]
*  This is a crisis of the president's own making [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=413.41999999999996s)]
*  to fulfill [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=416.7s)]

*  This is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=425.26s)]

*  For the commander-in-chief to suggest that we have to build a wall across our southern border because there are [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=429.74s)]

*  It is the single biggest national security failure in our lifetime and I contend and I pray to god i'm wrong [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=496.38s)]
*  That it's not a matter of if it's when this country will be attacked because of kamala harris and joe biden [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=502.54s)]

*  The biden harris administration is barely vetting any illegal immigrants and 90 plus percent get to say to get to stay [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB9nQileGfQ&t=564.94s)]
