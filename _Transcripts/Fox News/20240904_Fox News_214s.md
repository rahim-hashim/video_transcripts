# Donald Trump: The world is blowing up
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4)
*  Now, you just heard Kamala Harris, our country's failed border czar, talking about her commitment, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=0.0s)]
*  you need to courage to never say the word radical Islamic terrorism or illegal alien. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=5.5s)]
*  President Trump is back with us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Because who attacked us on 9-11 and who's crossing our border? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=15.56s)]
*  So she wants to be politically correct and we can't be politically correct anymore. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=18.64s)]
*  Look, we have October 7th, people saw it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=24.92s)]
*  We have things going on in the world right now with Israel and with the Middle East is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=32.08s)]
*  blowing up. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=37.0s)]
*  It's blowing up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=38.0s)]
*  We have Ukraine and Russia, that would never happen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=42.28s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=43.56s)]
*  If I were the president, it would have never happened and everybody knew it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=50.24s)]
*  They didn't have the money for Hamas and for Hezbollah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=51.24s)]
*  They didn't have the money for anybody they wanted to get by. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=54.68s)]
*  And we would have made a fair deal with them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=57.32s)]
*  I was only looking to make a fair deal with them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=59.56s)]
*  But you know, I wanted to say it so much during my term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=62.04s)]
*  We went four years without any blowups. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  We had no world trade show blow up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=69.84s)]
*  We had no radical Islamic terror. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=72.84s)]
*  We had no radical Islamic terror. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=75.84s)]
*  Because we were very tough at the borders and we were very tough with our statements [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  and we had no, the whole world was a safe place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=83.72s)]
*  That was the question they asked Victor Orban, who's really considered a very strong, they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=88.32s)]
*  said he's a strong man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=94.0s)]
*  Sometimes you need a strong man. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=95.76s)]
*  He's a strong man. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=97.24s)]
*  He's the prime minister of Hungary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=98.24s)]
*  And he said, you bring back Trump, everybody, now I'm not saying it, but he said it because [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=101.04s)]
*  I'd rather say respect. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=107.36s)]
*  But he said everybody was afraid of Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=109.32s)]
*  You bring them back, you're not going to have any problems. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=112.14s)]
*  It's all going to go away. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=114.78s)]
*  The world is blowing up. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=116.14s)]
*  The world is blowing up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=117.14s)]
*  And Sean, one thing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=118.14s)]
*  The world is blowing up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=119.14s)]
*  And when you look at Ukraine and you look at Russia, you look at all the things that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=120.14s)]
*  are happening, we are potentially getting ready. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=129.94s)]
*  I'm telling you, and I've made a lot of predictions and this is not a prediction because it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=132.86s)]
*  so bad. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=137.1s)]
*  I don't want it to be a prediction. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=138.1s)]
*  We're heading into World War Three territory and because of the power of weapons, nuclear [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=140.42s)]
*  weapons in particular, but other weapons also, and I know the weapons better than anybody [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=146.26s)]
*  because I'm the one that bought them and you know, we rebuilt our entire military. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  We upgraded our entire program. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  And you know, the one program I hated to upgrade, hated it was the nuclear program. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=159.94s)]
*  And I understand it may be better than anybody. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=166.6s)]
*  My uncle was at MIT, a professor, the longest serving professor in the history of MIT, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=168.7s)]
*  very smart guy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=174.22s)]
*  We have a smart family. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=175.22s)]
*  It's nice to have a smart family. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=176.22s)]
*  But I knew I understood nuclear for a long time, the power of nuclear weapons. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  You need a president that's not going to be taking you into war. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  We won't have World War Three when I'm elected. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  But with these clowns that you have in the United, you're going to end up having World [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=191.78s)]
*  War Three. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=195.54s)]
*  It's going to be a war like, it's going to be a war like no other. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T85kkNMHuu4&t=196.54s)]
