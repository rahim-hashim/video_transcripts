# Hannity: This is why Democrats ‘hate’ Elon Musk
**Fox News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc)
*  The Trump doctrine it is in full effect. It is shock and awe and the mainstream media and Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=0.0s)]
*  They are in shambles freaking out. They have no idea what is going on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=6.3s)]
*  So as a public service tonight, I will interpret for them [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=11.42s)]
*  Exactly what he said and what his true intentions are just like he's starting a trade war. Oh, there goes the economy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  Oh my no, they don't understand Donald Trump, but I will help them [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, even Stephen A Smith by the way is now calling his own party pathetic. Take a look [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=27.2s)]
*  the Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=32.56s)]
*  Might entertain running. I just might change my mind one day. I don't I doubt it, but I might [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Because how much would it take to beat y'all and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=45.84s)]
*  Trump can't run again [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=50.58s)]
*  And by the way, Stephen A apparently thinking about possibly running for president [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=52.98s)]
*  Okay, and we'll challenge him on his recent support for DEI. Oh [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  Also, stay tuned tonight. We have a preview [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=62.26s)]
*  Yours truly will be in a Super Bowl commercial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=65.42s)]
*  We have the ad and later Trump's a special envoy to the Middle East Steve [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=68.82s)]
*  Witkoff will be with us just hours after the president delivered this stern warning to the mullahs of Iran and much more take a look [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=73.46s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon with me. It's very simple Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=81.34s)]
*  We don't want to be tough on Iran. We don't want to be tough on anybody, but they just can't have a nuclear [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=88.38s)]
*  Why say that you're unhappy to sign it if it's Iran? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=92.94s)]
*  And their proxies who have threatened to retaliate against you and your team by killing you guys for taking out? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=96.78s)]
*  so long well, they haven't done that and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=104.14s)]
*  That would be a terrible thing for them to do not because of me if they did that they would be obliterated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=106.62s)]
*  That would be the end. I've left instructions if they do it they get obliterated. There won't be anything left and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=115.22s)]
*  They should be able to do it and Biden should have said that but he never did [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  The president also introduced tonight a proposal for the future of Gaza [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=127.94s)]
*  He said the Palestinian population needs to be absorbed by other countries [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  Gaza needs to be demilitarized and he's offering to do the job and rebuild it into a beautiful safe haven take a look [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=137.26s)]
*  The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=145.1s)]
*  It's right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site virtually every building is down [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=151.82s)]
*  They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=157.94s)]
*  they instead can [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=163.94s)]
*  Occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=165.86s)]
*  Instead of having to go back and do it again [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=172.58s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=175.18s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  level the site and get rid of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=188.02s)]
*  Destroyed buildings level it out create an economic development that will supply [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=191.02s)]
*  unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=196.54s)]

*  Terrorists to launch attacks against Israel and others and if you knew Donald Trump even a little bit [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  You would think he came down the escalator in 2015 [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=222.14s)]
*  Donald Trump is once once again, just like in saying he would have tariffs [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=225.38s)]

*  Eliminate terrorism in the area and a new day will begin now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to talk to Steve Wichoff a special envoy to the Mideast about the president's big plans [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=242.78s)]
*  And that includes Israel Gaza Iran and thanks to Biden's weakness [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=248.42s)]
*  Iran has reportedly now been working with North Korea to build a nuclear missile that would be capable of hitting Europe [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  That can never happen [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=260.26s)]
*  But that project is coming to an end on the president Trump along with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=261.46s)]
*  America's maximum pressure campaign it is back peace through strength has returned the deep [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=267.26000000000005s)]

*  And yet Elon Musk is seizing the power that belongs to the American people [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=489.4s)]
*  We are here to fight back [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=498.4s)]
*  You fight back Elizabeth because guess what? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=502.4s)]
*  What you don't like is Elon Musk was appointed by the president duly elected by the people [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=505.4s)]
*  And he is exposing all the waste fraud abuse and abuse and frankly outright stealing of American taxpayer dollars [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=510.4s)]
*  And he's going to clean it up whether you like it or not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=520.4s)]
*  And it gets worse one Democratic Congresswoman claiming we are now at war and it's time to shut down Washington DC and fight in the streets [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=523.4s)]

*  We are at war [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=552.4s)]
*  Anytime anytime a person can pay $250 million into a campaign [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=555.4s)]
*  And they'd be given access for access to the Department of Treasury of the United States of America [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=561.4s)]
*  We are at war [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=568.4s)]
*  We're at war? Wow. Most Democrats didn't seem to care about Americans in East Palestine or the hurricane victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=571.4s)]
*  They made excuses for California's government as fire hydrants and reservoirs ran dry and entire neighborhoods burned to the ground in LA [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=581.4s)]
*  They said nothing as millions of unvetted Harris Biden illegal immigrants including terrorists, cartel members, gang members all poured across our southern border [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=590.4s)]
*  And again that worked up. Elon Musk uncovers massive government waste, fraud, abuse, exposes billions and billions and billions of far left taxpayer funded global piggy bank [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=600.4s)]
*  That they get their power from and they're ready to go to war [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=612.4s)]
*  According to the left, Elon Musk is now anti-American, a threat to democracy. Why? For holding America's elected bureaucracy accountable? Take a look [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=616.4s)]
*  We are witnessing a constitutional crisis. We talked about Trump wanting to be a dictator on day one and here we are [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=628.4s)]
*  This is what the beginning of dictatorship looks like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=640.4s)]
*  This is a constitutional crisis that we are in today. Let's call it what it is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=645.4s)]
*  The people get to decide how we defend the United States of America. The people get to decide how their taxpayer money is spent. Elon Musk does not get to decide [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=651.4s)]
*  If democracy is a quote unquote left wing ideology to Elon Musk, this man is un-American as far as my definition of America is [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=664.4s)]
*  And the fact that more people aren't offended by this man's actions shows you how much he has helped successfully destroy the trusted information ecosystem because this is a five alarm fire [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=672.4s)]
*  Elon Musk is a five alarm fire and the country doesn't realize it yet [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=689.4s)]
*  This dude is probably one of the most unintelligent billionaires I have ever met or seen or witnessed [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=694.4s)]
*  Which you can probably even glean that from watching these people on TV [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=703.4s)]
*  Anyways, all of that is to say is that they don't do their homework [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=709.4s)]
*  So, I mean, are Americans going to be okay with Musk? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=714.4s)]
*  No! [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=719.4s)]
*  Oh, okay [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=720.4s)]
*  A guy nobody voted for having all this kind of power [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=722.4s)]
*  Let's see, SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla, oh, rescuing astronauts that Harris and Biden lost in space [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=728.4s)]
*  That would be Donald Trump, I'm sorry, that would be Elon Musk getting lectured on intelligence from AOC [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=736.4s)]
*  Okay, I'll put that in the back of my head [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=742.4s)]
*  They hate Musk because he's exposing all of this misappropriation of your hard-earned tax dollars [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=746.4s)]
*  We'll scroll it again in a minute [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=753.4s)]
*  And also because he is helping Donald Trump fulfill his promise [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=755.4s)]
*  And we're returning to limited government, greater freedom and not wasting our money abroad [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=760.4s)]
*  But we're going to put the American people first [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=767.4s)]
*  And you want to go to war and you want to assassinate the character of Elon Musk who's doing this for free? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=770.4s)]
*  Really? Remember, we are $40 trillion in debt [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=776.4s)]
*  They are stealing your money [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=781.4s)]
*  They are stealing the money for your children and your grandchildren [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=783.4s)]
*  And the Biden administration, we just found out today, made $236 billion in improper payments last year alone [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=787.4s)]
*  That's a quarter of a trillion dollars they wasted [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=796.4s)]
*  And we're now beginning to see where they're spending that money because they get their power doing that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=799.4s)]
*  And the inflation under Biden devalued the dollar by more than 20% [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=804.4s)]
*  Americans struggling to get by, they're living paycheck to paycheck [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=809.4s)]
*  They're paying the bare minimum on their credit cards [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=813.4s)]
*  The Democratic Party's upset that all this money, this insanity, this DEI, woke ideology, Green New Deal madness abroad [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=816.4s)]
*  Not even for our country, is no longer going to be able to fund transgender operas in Europe and DEI programs in Asia [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=825.4s)]
*  And they're calling this a constitutional crisis, their word of the day [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=833.4s)]
*  This is madness [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=837.4s)]
*  And thanks to President Trump and Elon Musk, America is being rescued from a malignant, out of control bureaucracy [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=839.4s)]
*  The swamp is being drained [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=847.4s)]
*  Welcome aboard, those in the swamp [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=849.4s)]
*  Well, they're pretty angry about it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=851.4s)]
*  Thank you [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLV0iJhB3Oc&t=855.4s)]
