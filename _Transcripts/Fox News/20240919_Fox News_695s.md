# Sean Hannity: This is a 'major blow' to the Harris campaign
**Fox News:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48)
*  But first, we are at a tipping point for our country with the election less than seven [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=0.0s)]
*  weeks away. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=4.48s)]
*  Early voting already started. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=5.48s)]
*  And unfortunately for the Kamala Harris campaign, it was another day of kind of bad headlines [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=7.48s)]
*  this morning, the uncommitted national movement. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Now, you might recall, during the Democratic primaries, this is the group that organized [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=15.92s)]
*  protest votes against Biden in the primary because of the Harris-Biden support of Israel, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  which hasn't been great anyway, in the war against the radical Islamic terrorist group [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=28.6s)]
*  Hamas, the group that has in their charter the full destruction of Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=33.44s)]
*  And they announced they're not going to endorse Kamala Harris in this election cycle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=38.36s)]
*  Make no mistake, a major blow to the Harris campaign during the Democratic primaries earlier [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=43.04s)]
*  this year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=48.6s)]
*  The group mobilized over 700,000 Democrats to vote against Biden, uncommitted, actually [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=49.6s)]
*  finished in second place in the primaries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=56.76s)]
*  They had 37 delegates. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=59.76s)]
*  But the bigger problem for her campaign comes from, well, where are a lot of these voters? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=62.2s)]
*  They're from Michigan. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=68.56s)]
*  The uncommitted option received over 13 percent of the Democratic primary vote. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=69.72s)]
*  In Minnesota, uncommitted received nearly 19 percent of the vote. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=74.52s)]
*  In Wisconsin, more than 8 percent of the Democratic primary voters chose uninterested and uninstructed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=78.92s)]
*  delegates. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=87.44s)]
*  Alarm bells should be going off inside the Harris campaign. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=88.84s)]
*  Now, this group and their refusal to endorse her could spell major trouble for Kamala. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  In state, she desperately needs to win to have any chance of actually becoming president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=98.0s)]
*  To make matters worse, this non-endorsement comes only one day after the shocking announcement [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=103.0s)]
*  from the Teamsters Union that they would not be endorsing Kamala Harris, marking the first [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  time since 96 that the union did not endorse the Democratic candidate for president. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, yesterday, the union released a poll showing 60, nearly 60 percent of their members [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=119.8s)]
*  rank and file support Donald Trump for president. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=125.4s)]
*  Only 34 percent support Kamala Harris, head of the announcement, proving yet again more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  working class voters are supporting Trump and the Republican Party and the conservative [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=135.56s)]
*  movement and how the Democratic Party, as I've been telling you for a long time, they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=141.32s)]
*  have become the party of coastal elites from Hollywood to D.C. to New York City. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=146.6s)]
*  And by the way, our very own Lawrence Jones on Fox and Friends, he spoke with energy workers [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=153.0s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=157.52s)]
*  Listen to what they had to say. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=158.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who's the vice president, was once against fracking. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=160.52s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=164.04s)]
*  She now says she's for fracking. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=166.44s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=168.08s)]
*  Do you believe her? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=169.48s)]
*  No, I believe she's out there saying whatever she can to make people, you know, try to swing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=170.48s)]
*  her way so that she can try to get the presidency. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=175.0s)]
*  The sentiment around this whole region is nobody believes that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=178.56s)]
*  I don't believe anybody in that administration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=181.84s)]
*  What do you believe happens if she becomes the president? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=184.12s)]
*  You're going to have even more regulation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=187.84s)]
*  You're going to have people that banks aren't going to want to invest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=189.68s)]
*  You're going to see people move out of the areas where the drilling and gas is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=193.44s)]
*  These are high-paying, career union jobs in the energy sector that will be at risk when [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=199.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris pushes her EV mandate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=206.24s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=209.24s)]
*  High-paying, career union jobs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=210.24s)]
*  And when Ford loses $4.5 billion because of their mandate to produce cars that their customers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=213.2s)]
*  don't want, if customers want an electric vehicle, they're going to go to Tesla. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=219.72s)]
*  They're not going to go to Ford. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=224.4s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=226.8s)]
*  Ford can't lose that much money and keep paying union workers the money with the benefits [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=227.8s)]
*  that they need and deserve. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=232.84s)]
*  And that news doesn't end there because breaking today, a new poll of registered voters [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=234.96s)]
*  released by the New York Times of all places showing, look right there, Donald Trump with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=240.6s)]
*  a one-point lead nationwide. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=246.4s)]
*  And all of this comes despite the fact that Kamala has gotten a complete free pass from [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  the corrupt state-run media mob since Biden dropped out of the race. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, she has faced almost zero tough questions from the press about her radical positions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=257.74s)]
*  in her own words. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=263.44s)]
*  We call them on Hannity.com, the Kamala files. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=264.96s)]
*  You can download them for free as a public service. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=267.42s)]
*  And she has a lot to answer for. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=270.18s)]
*  Is she going to get through this entire campaign and not have to answer any of these extreme [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=271.82s)]
*  radical positions? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=276.62s)]
*  You know, why did she suddenly change her position on nearly every important issue? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=278.1s)]
*  For example—and by the way, do you believe it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=282.74s)]
*  Because I don't. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=284.62s)]
*  You know, why did she once say the state had a right to go into a gun owner's home and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=285.62s)]
*  just inspect how they're handling their weapon and the privacy of their own home, on top [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=290.38s)]
*  of, of course, the mandatory gun buyback that she's on tape saying she supports? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=296.1s)]
*  Does she still believe in decriminalizing illegal immigration and giving illegal immigrants [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=301.74s)]
*  free housing, health care, education, driver's licenses in Minnesota, college for free, amnesty? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, and my favorite, if you're an illegal immigrant, please know Kamala believes in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  your right to get a free sex change operation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=319.6s)]
*  Is anybody going to ask her in the next 46 days about any of these questions? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=323.22s)]
*  What about the Americans that have been murdered and raped and victims of violent crime by [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  Harris Biden, unvetted illegal immigrants? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=335.66s)]
*  Does she still support, you know, the radical capital-killing $93 trillion Green New Deal [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  that she co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders with her promise to eliminate the filibuster [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=344.72s)]
*  to pass that? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, why did she sponsor it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  And why, if she sponsored it, does she no longer believe in it? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  Or do you actually believe she doesn't believe in it? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=357.5s)]
*  And of course, she also sponsored with Bernie in the Senate, government health care for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  all and no freedom for you to have any private health insurance. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=365.3s)]
*  And why did she say it was courageous not to say the term illegal immigrant or alien [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=369.7s)]
*  and radical Islamic terrorism? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  Does she still believe in that? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=376.9s)]
*  Now, these are some of the questions. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=378.42s)]
*  You know, 60 plus days in, she has not answered. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  And with only 46 days left, she needs to answer. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=383.94s)]
*  The media needs to demand answers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=387.46s)]
*  The media mob so far refuses to challenge her and ask her, and they just are basically [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=390.18s)]
*  an extension of her press office. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=396.3s)]
*  Finally, after nearly two months, the Harris campaign strategy, however hiding from the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=398.3s)]
*  press, is finally getting a little bit of pushback from the left. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=402.98s)]
*  Look at this New York Times guest essay. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=406.74s)]
*  Now, it was written by the outlet's former L.A. bureau chief, which he titled, quote, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=409.06s)]
*  the political cost of Kamala Harris not answering direct questions. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=415.9s)]
*  She's not even being asked the right questions in the essay. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=420.29999999999995s)]
*  He says it would, quote, go a long way for her to offer some direct and succinct answers [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=423.46s)]
*  to questions about her plans. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  Even Chuckie Todd raising concerns about the lack of details in her plan in terms of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=431.34s)]
*  economy. Take a look. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=436.7s)]
*  I think it's been a bit risky of Harris not to have a lot out there, not to sort of you [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=438.58s)]
*  asked a fascinating question because think about this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=443.42s)]
*  At this point in a campaign, we normally have an idea of what's the big thing they're going [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=445.54s)]
*  to do. Yeah. Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=449.5s)]
*  We knew that with Biden it was going to be covid related, but it was going to be a big [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=450.74s)]
*  thing. You knew it, as you pointed out, Trump with tax cuts. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  What is her first 100 days? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=456.62s)]
*  What is the on day one? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=458.5s)]
*  I'm going to do X. We know what he's going to try to do on day one. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=460.06s)]
*  Whether you agree with it or not, there are plans to do that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=462.74s)]
*  But I wonder if that's you know, that's going to hurt her at some point. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=465.74s)]
*  If voters are going, yeah, I don't like what he's doing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  But what are you going to do? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=472.22s)]
*  And it's been a lot of vagueness. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=473.86s)]
*  Chuck, just listen to her in her own words. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=477.02000000000004s)]
*  Do your research. Tim Russert used to host me. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=480.94000000000005s)]
*  Meet the press. Tim Russert always did his research. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=484.1s)]
*  I knew Tim Russert. Tim Russert was very nice to me. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=486.94000000000005s)]
*  Tim Russert used to call me and ask my opinions on why I thought this way as a conservative. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=490.22s)]
*  I even did debates. He would moderate between me and James Carville. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=495.3s)]
*  And he'd come on my radio show. His book, Big Russ, one of the best books I ever read. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  It's a great book. And the follow up was a great book, too. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  So but Russert would do his homework. Here's your homework, Chuck. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=506.5s)]
*  She supports the 93 trillion dollar Green New Deal. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  Chuck, she co-sponsored it with Bernie Sanders in the U.S. Senate. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=513.5s)]
*  Chuck, she said she would eliminate the filibuster to pass it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=517.06s)]
*  Chuck, she's now proposed the largest tax increase in the history in the country, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=520.62s)]
*  including taxing unrealized capital gains. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=525.98s)]
*  Listen to what she says. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=528.9s)]
*  And unless she changes that, you can assume that's her position. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=530.9s)]
*  You know, this pushback or, you know, alleged pushback or minor pushback from the liberal media mob, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=534.86s)]
*  you know, who are already 100 percent in the tank from Kamala Harris, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=540.86s)]
*  is fairly meaningless unless they get answers. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  According to a new report, look at this. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=546.7s)]
*  Ninety-five percent of coverage of Donald Trump on ABC, CBS, NBC, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=548.82s)]
*  has been negative since the second assassination attempt over the weekend. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=554.5s)]
*  And wait until you see the interview that aired on Fake News CNN yesterday [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=559.46s)]
*  between one of the network's reporters and a Trump supporter. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=563.66s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=567.26s)]
*  What's your most important issue? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=569.46s)]
*  The economy, getting the interest rates down, getting it to where we can afford to live in America. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=571.9s)]
*  Right now, it's too expensive. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=576.9s)]
*  OK, now let me maybe ask like a slightly impolite question. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=579.22s)]
*  But, you know, if you can afford a boat, you're not hurting so bad, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=584.22s)]
*  Because a boat costs a lot of money and it's a lot of upkeep. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=588.58s)]
*  Listen, nobody gave me ****. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=591.58s)]
*  I earned everything that I've got. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=593.58s)]
*  I'm retired military, retired power plant, and I am successful and retired with boats, jet skis, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=595.58s)]
*  because I did it right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=602.38s)]
*  And everybody has that chance. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=603.58s)]
*  Whether they choose or not, that's up to them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=605.58s)]
*  By the way, that boat does not look like a hundred million dollar yacht. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=609.58s)]
*  Let's be honest here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=613.94s)]
*  But don't worry. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=615.94s)]
*  Tonight, Kamala Harris sat down for a hard-hitting campaign interview for the first time. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=616.94s)]
*  It was with Oprah, who not only endorsed her, but spoke at the DNC. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=621.94s)]
*  Take a look at this hard-hitting interview. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=626.94s)]
*  President Biden stepped aside and withdrew his candidacy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=629.94s)]
*  That a veil or something dropped and you just stepped into your power. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  Looking at you at a speech like the week before, which was a great speech, very nice. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  And then the next week, I saw you walking in the thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, we each have those moments in our lives where it's time to step up. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  Time to step up. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=662.3000000000001s)]
*  Time to step up, you know. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=663.66s)]
*  Well, the moment you heard, I mean, I really have been saying to people it felt like a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=665.66s)]
*  veil dropped and you sort of stepped through that veil. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=669.66s)]
*  Did that actually, did you feel like that? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=672.66s)]
*  I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=674.66s)]
*  And with that comes a sense of purpose. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHZnR93y48&t=680.66s)]
