# North Dakota caucuses called for Trump
**Fox News:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0)
*  And this is a Fox News alert. The AP has just called the North Dakota Republican caucuses for former President Donald Trump, who beats Nikki Haley on the eve of Super Tuesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, several new 2024 election polls were just released. And long story short, former President Donald Trump beating Joe Biden in all of them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=13.0s)]
*  But if you really dig deep into the numbers, you will see that Joe Biden has a lot to worry about tonight, just 240 days away from November 5th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=22.0s)]
*  The New York Times-Siena poll, 10 percent of 2020, Biden voters now say they'll be backing Donald Trump in that same poll. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=30.0s)]
*  40 percent say Trump's policies helped them. 43 percent of respondents say Joe Biden's policies have hurt them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=39.0s)]
*  The CBS poll had an interesting question. How is the economy under Donald Trump? 65 percent said good. Right now, under Joe Biden, 60 percent say it's bad. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=46.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal and their poll, well, is just the latest one to find immigration as the top issue for voters this year. And that's obviously not good for Joe Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=57.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, our very own Fox News poll finds that Trump is enjoying huge amounts of support from voters that he hasn't done well with in the past. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=67.0s)]
*  Trump earns 28 percent of the African-American vote, 51 percent of majority, 51 percent majority among voters under the age of 30. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=75.0s)]
*  Young people, they tend to vote more Democratic. 48 percent support with Hispanic Americans. 43 percent support with suburban women, plus even 8 percent from Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=86.0s)]
*  If these numbers hold, if half of them hold, Joe Biden would be in serious trouble in 245 days. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-Xf8ZF7s0&t=97.0s)]
