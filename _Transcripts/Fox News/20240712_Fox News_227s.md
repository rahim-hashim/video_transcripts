# Vivek Ramaswamy: Biden is ‘done’
**Fox News:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo)
*  former GOP presidential candidate Vivek [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=0.0s)]
*  Ramaswamy. Anything I say wrong there? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=2.58s)]
*  Look, I think the most important [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=7.68s)]
*  part is the indictment of the media, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=9.24s)]
*  and many people, Sean, have asked [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=11.24s)]
*  why are we focused on the media? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=12.88s)]
*  Well, here's the answer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=14.72s)]
*  If the media had been fault free [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=15.8s)]
*  in the last few elections, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=17.64s)]
*  maybe this wouldn't be about the media, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=19.0s)]
*  but this is the same media that lied in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=20.84s)]
*  2016 about the Trump-Russia collusion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  hoax lied in 2020 on the eve of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=24.68s)]
*  election about the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=27.12s)]
*  and the same media on the eve of this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=29.0s)]
*  election that lied about Joe Biden's health. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=31.12s)]
*  So the sad part is in this country [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=33.2s)]
*  it has now become a tradition, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=35.28s)]
*  sadly, in every election for there [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=36.88s)]
*  to be at least one major lie. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=38.6s)]
*  The media is told on the eve of a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=40.44s)]
*  major presidential election and that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  needs to stop to rebuild trust in this country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=44.0s)]
*  That's why this goes beyond Joe Biden [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  and goes to the issue of public [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=48.16s)]
*  trust in this country as it relates [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=49.92s)]
*  to Biden. Sean, he's done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=51.68s)]
*  Biden has done. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=52.84s)]
*  This is just a question of price. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=53.64s)]
*  They're negotiating the exit package. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=55.44s)]
*  I mean that metaphorically, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  if not literally, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=57.72s)]
*  that's what that looks like. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=58.44s)]
*  But the media question is going to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=59.8s)]
*  outlive Biden's exit and is going to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=61.48s)]
*  require a lot of healing in this country [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  to get over. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=65.2s)]
*  It's a lie of historic proportions, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=66.52s)]
*  just like the Russia hoax was a lie. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=68.6s)]
*  And it was Hillary Clinton's bought [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=70.84s)]
*  and paid for dirty dossier. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=72.64s)]
*  It was used for four FISA warrants. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=74.12s)]
*  Nobody in the media cared that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=76.08s)]
*  that Mar-a-Lago was valued by a judge [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=78.84s)]
*  at $18 million in a valuations case [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=81.16s)]
*  when a rudimentary perusal of real estate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=84.44s)]
*  in Palm Beach would show it was closer [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=86.96s)]
*  to a billion dollars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=88.64s)]
*  None of them cared. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  They didn't care that the statute [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=91.32s)]
*  of limitations had run out on [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=93.08s)]
*  what was a misdemeanor in New York [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=96.0s)]
*  that they they come up with a novel [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=98.0s)]
*  legal theory and a liberal jury [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  and a D.A. that had pledged to get [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=102.55999999999999s)]
*  Trump to go after him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  They don't care about any of it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  All they care about is their leftist [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=108.52s)]
*  state run agenda. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=111.24s)]
*  This is propped to America here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=112.32s)]
*  And, you know, I said journalism is dead. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=114.8s)]
*  It's deeper than that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=117.68s)]
*  The reality is the coordinated nature [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=121.4s)]
*  of this is what's problematic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=123.28s)]
*  This is an ideological cartel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=124.64s)]
*  It's not a cartel of products. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=126.84s)]
*  It's a cartel of ideas. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=128.48s)]
*  And here's how you know that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=130.28s)]
*  If this had really been about Joe Biden's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=131.44s)]
*  health and their journalistic concern [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=133.36s)]
*  about it, you wouldn't have seen [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=134.84s)]
*  everybody shift at the exact same time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=136.08s)]
*  Apparently, Chuck Todd knew two years ago [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=138.48s)]
*  that cabinet secretaries, probably [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=140.08s)]
*  whose names Biden didn't even know at the time, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=141.68s)]
*  were confiding to him that they had [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=143.6s)]
*  concerns about Joe Biden's health. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=144.76s)]
*  You would have seen a more steady stream [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=146.56s)]
*  of media inquiry about this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=148.4s)]
*  But the fact that they all decided at [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  the exact same time, I think signals, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=151.68s)]
*  Sean, that there is a deeper managerial [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  class in this country spanning the media, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  the public sector and the private sector, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=158.44s)]
*  from the George Clooney's of the world [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=160.64s)]
*  to the Chuck Todd's, all the way to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=161.88s)]
*  people in the deep state in Washington, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=163.64s)]
*  D.C., that together decide that it is time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=165.16s)]
*  The people we elect to run the government, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=168.12s)]
*  even Joe Biden, they're not really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=169.88s)]
*  the people who actually run the government. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=171.72s)]
*  It's the shadow government in that deep state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  And one of the things I am most excited about, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=175.84s)]
*  about the prospect of a second Trump term, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=178.16s)]
*  is finally a president who is willing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=180.24s)]
*  to really take an ax to that deep state [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=182.36s)]
*  and say that for once and for all, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=184.8s)]
*  whether you're Democrat or Republican, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=186.32s)]
*  the people we elect to run the government [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=188.12s)]
*  will once again run the government [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  rather than the puppet of a president [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=191.72s)]
*  who's sitting in the White House right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=193.4s)]
*  You know, they don't give a damn about [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=196.0s)]
*  the American people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=198.08s)]
*  They don't give a damn about the people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=199.44s)]
*  that voted for Biden. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=201.08s)]
*  And I will tell you, if we don't fix this now, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  those powerful forces are only gonna get stronger [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=207.68s)]
*  and be more emboldened. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a strong admonition. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4KBxa0HQo&t=213.0s)]
