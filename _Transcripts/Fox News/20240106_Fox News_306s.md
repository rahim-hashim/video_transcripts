# Judge Jeanine: This is about HIDING from the truth
**Fox News:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ)
*  The one and only, my dear friend, Happy New Year, Judge Jeanine Pirro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Judge, great to have you back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Happy New Year, Sean. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=5.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=6.68s)]
*  All right, it's kind of simple to me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=8.48s)]
*  They did hold Steve Bannon in contempt, didn't they? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=11.48s)]
*  They held Peter Navarro in contempt. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=13.92s)]
*  I thought we had equal justice and equal application of our laws, so I would assume the Democrats [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=16.76s)]
*  that voted to hold Bannon and Navarro in contempt are going to hold Hunter in contempt, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=22.36s)]
*  Well, look, Sean. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=28.6s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=30.0s)]
*  I believe in the criminal justice system. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=31.0s)]
*  I gave my life to it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=32.92s)]
*  But I have to tell you, the more I see this, the more I become so disillusioned. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=34.2s)]
*  Look, they're preparing a resolution for Congress to hold Hunter Biden in contempt. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Not only is he in contempt because he defied a congressional subpoena, but he thumbed his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=43.72s)]
*  nose at Congress and the American people when he actually went out and held a media event [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=48.24s)]
*  and basically said, my father didn't do anything and then took no questions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=55.0s)]
*  He said, look, I want to do this in the open. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=59.32s)]
*  I don't want to do it behind closed doors. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Look, you don't get the opportunity to tell Congress how they should or shouldn't interview you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=64.0s)]
*  So the bottom line is that if there's any justice in this country, he will be held in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=69.2s)]
*  contempt the way Bannon and Navarro have been held in contempt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=73.52s)]
*  But, you know, and now we hear that his sugar brother, Kevin Morris, is giving him money. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=77.36s)]
*  They want to do a documentary on his life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=83.76s)]
*  So we see him as the great father that he is, but for the child of the woman that he [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=85.8s)]
*  doesn't like. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=90.08s)]
*  And what a great painter and what a great worker he is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=91.08s)]
*  So this is all about PR and hiding from the truth. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=93.84s)]
*  So Democrats now, they're trying to claim that, well, Donald Trump owned a hotel in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Washington, D.C. and people from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, whatever, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=102.44s)]
*  that they actually went to the hotel and they say, see, Donald Trump got paid by foreign [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=108.4s)]
*  governments and it's against the Emoluments Clause. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=113.88s)]
*  The only problem is there's a big difference, isn't there, between Joe Biden going against [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=116.88s)]
*  Obama administration policy after taking a call from Hunter and two Burisma executives [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=122.52s)]
*  that desperately needed D.C. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=128.84s)]
*  help because they wanted the investigator in Ukraine, Victor Shokin, fired. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=130.4s)]
*  There's kind of a big difference that he leveraged a billion dollars. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  And as a result of his official actions, Hunter continued to get paid for sitting on that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=139.28s)]
*  board with no experience at a time when he was addicted to pretty hard drugs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=146.44s)]
*  Any comparison in your mind? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  There's absolutely no comparison. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=154.8s)]
*  Donald Trump wasn't involved in the business once he became president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=156.68s)]
*  The bottom line is he had properties. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=160.84s)]
*  He was entitled to have someone else monitor those properties and make money from those [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  properties. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=168.36s)]
*  OK, now let's talk about Hunter Biden. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=169.36s)]
*  Hunter Biden was supposed to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=172.4s)]
*  Anyone who represents a foreign country interest in the United States is supposed to register. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=176.68s)]
*  In fact, this lawyer named I think it's Beretta ends up retroactively registering as a foreign [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=182.72s)]
*  agent because he as a lawyer represented Zolcheski, who was the president of Burisma at exactly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=189.4s)]
*  the same time that Hunter did. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=195.64s)]
*  Now, the fact that Hunter didn't register as a foreign agent and this guy registered [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=198.08s)]
*  retroactively, I can show you another example of the inconsistent justice because Paul Manafort [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=203.28s)]
*  tried to do the same thing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  He said, let me register retroactively and they wouldn't let him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=210.52s)]
*  And he ended up going to jail. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=214.4s)]
*  But the truth is that Hunter Biden not only was representing a foreign interest in the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=216.44s)]
*  United States, he called his father, as soon as Zolcheski, the owner of or the head of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=221.52s)]
*  Burisma called, he said, Dad, we've got to get the prosecutor off this case or I'm not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=227.16s)]
*  going to be able to make any money being on the board. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=231.68s)]
*  Three days later, Joe Biden goes over. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=234.36s)]
*  He leverages our tax dollars, Sean. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  That was a billion dollars of our money. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=239.44s)]
*  They get the prosecutor off and together they end up making sure that the Biden family gets [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  all the money that they need. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=247.62s)]
*  And you want to call that that is corruption. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=249.8s)]
*  It's a violation of Farah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, Hunter Biden is going to be arraigned on, I believe, February 11th on [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  nine counts in Los Angeles related to tax charges, but not for an Agent Registration [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=260.04s)]
*  Act. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=265.6s)]
*  You know why? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=266.6s)]
*  Because that will connect Joe Biden and they don't want to look at Joe Biden. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=267.6s)]
*  They allowed the twenty fourteen and fifteen years to pass the statute of limitations because [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  that's when Hunter Biden says me and my dad are watching here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  We want 10 million dollars. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=280.44s)]
*  This is a sad commentary on justice. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=282.32s)]
*  And today Joe Biden gets out there and talks about democracy on the ballot. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=285.12s)]
*  It is laughable, Sean. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=289.44s)]
*  All right, Judge, happy New Year. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDvG_JSAZPQ&t=291.32s)]
