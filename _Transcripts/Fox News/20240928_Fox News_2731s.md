# Fox News Primetime Recap - Sept. 27, 2024
**Fox News:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk)
*  Kamala's high crimes at the border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2.84s)]
*  So as I said, she's hitting the border, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=7.04s)]
*  hoping to turn the page on her reputation [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  as an open border zealot. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=11.78s)]
*  But instead, the book was open to reveal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=13.74s)]
*  the stomach-churning truth [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=16.32s)]
*  about the criminal element she welcomed in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=18.28s)]
*  In response to a congressional request for information, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=21.68s)]
*  ICE revealed that more than 13,000 illegal aliens [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=24.78s)]
*  convicted of murder are now in the United States. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=28.3s)]
*  Oh, and they're not in custody. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=32.8s)]
*  More than 1,800 have been accused of murder as well. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=35.34s)]
*  Nearly 16,000 have been convicted of sexual assault. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=38.68s)]
*  But the Harris campaign is out with a new ad [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=43.68s)]
*  celebrating her border cred. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=45.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris has never backed down from a challenge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=51.96s)]
*  and she will secure our border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=56.2s)]
*  Yes, someone got paid huge money to produce that ad. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=59.54s)]
*  They really think Americans are that stupid? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=63.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they think. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=65.9s)]
*  Now, her role as California's AG [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=67.58s)]
*  mostly involves state-level crimes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  not big cartel cases. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=72.58s)]
*  And News Nation notes that her claims [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=74.28s)]
*  about jailing gang members for cross-border smuggling [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=76.28s)]
*  also seems inflated, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  because her cases mostly involve local drug offenses, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=82.22s)]
*  not international smuggling operations. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=85.72s)]
*  And in the Tucson sector where she's speaking today, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  under Harris and Biden, Customs Border Protection [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  logged 1.2 million, as they call them, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=94.04s)]
*  encounters since they took office. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=97.34s)]
*  Now, during Trump's four years in office, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  almost 1 million fewer came in, or 246,000. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=102.54s)]
*  Bill Mollusian will give us key details [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=109.18s)]
*  in the total numbers coming up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=111.12s)]
*  They're truly shocking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, this has already devastated cities and towns across America, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  and there's no other conclusion to draw [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  except that Biden and Harris and Mayorkas [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=121.06s)]
*  conspired to intentionally subvert [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  America's sovereignty and the rule of law. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, they believe borders are immoral. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, unless they're Ukraine's. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=132.04s)]
*  They want an unending torrent of cheap labor [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=134.04s)]
*  flooding into the United States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=137.28s)]
*  And this is key, they want to change the electorate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=139.1s)]
*  Yeah, Elon Musk is right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  Now, if this isn't impeachable conduct, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=145.74s)]
*  I don't know what is, and I said this years ago, by the way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=148.78s)]
*  How is this not a high crime, high crimes and misdemeanors? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=151.58s)]
*  Americans are dying because of these policies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=155.08s)]
*  And remember back in 2019, Democrats impeached Donald Trump [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  based on what he said on a phone call with Zelensky. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, Democrats spent countless man hours, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  untold amounts of taxpayer money on a sham proceeding [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=171.06s)]
*  meant to hobble his presidency and affect the campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=175.22s)]
*  And the catalyst, let's not forget, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=179.0s)]
*  were Ukrainian apologists working in the White House. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=180.54s)]
*  Yet Joe and Kamala fling open our borders [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=184.38s)]
*  to millions of foreigners. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  They fast-track them into our communities. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=190.18s)]
*  They destroy local cultures, they already strain budgets. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=192.44s)]
*  And all along, we find out they've tried [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=196.32s)]
*  to hide the truth about the criminals [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  that they allowed to walk right in and brutalize us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=202.94s)]
*  Again, I ask, how is that not a high crime in and of itself? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=206.78s)]
*  The families of the victims who Biden and Harris [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=213.32s)]
*  have left behind probably have another word for this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=216.22s)]
*  I would imagine the word treason is on their minds. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=219.9s)]
*  Now, look at these faces. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=223.74s)]
*  They've been arrested for everything from rape, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=225.84s)]
*  murder, carjacking, robbery, domestic assault, DWI. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=228.66s)]
*  None of them should have been here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=235.14s)]
*  And Harris's empty border rhetoric tonight [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=237.94s)]
*  does nothing to change the suffering [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=240.94s)]
*  endured by these families. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  The horrors that my daughter suffered, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=245.48s)]
*  and it's because of these open borders. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  They are nothing but monsters who are predators, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=251.88s)]
*  and those are the kind of individuals [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=254.61999999999998s)]
*  that we so openly let in this country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=256.14s)]
*  I believe the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=259.82s)]
*  open border policies are responsible [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=261.86s)]
*  for the death of my daughter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=263.9s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and every Democrat [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=265.42s)]
*  who supports these open border policies [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=268.06s)]
*  are complicit in the deaths of 300,000 innocent Americans, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=270.64s)]
*  including my son Weston. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=277.14s)]
*  Now, it took ICE, by the way, about six months [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=279.94s)]
*  to get back to Congressman Gonzalez [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=282.74s)]
*  when he requested this information. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=284.38s)]
*  But Harris has been so intent on keeping this out of the news [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=286.92s)]
*  that she won't even speak to her own administration's border chief, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=288.94s)]
*  and she didn't speak to the last border patrol chief either. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=292.24s)]
*  I've never had one conversation with the president [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=295.86s)]
*  or the vice president for that matter, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=298.68s)]
*  and so I was the chief of the border patrol. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  I commanded 21,000 people. That's a problem. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=303.08s)]
*  But pretending there's not a crisis of your own making [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=309.24s)]
*  is not a strategy, madam vice president. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=313.02s)]
*  It's a tacit admission of failure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=316.2s)]
*  The border patrol, by the way, you know, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=320.0s)]
*  it doesn't really need more resources. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=321.3s)]
*  What it needs is a president [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=323.56s)]
*  who believes that it's the fundamental duty, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=325.06s)]
*  really the first duty of a president, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=327.44s)]
*  to secure our borders. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=329.58s)]
*  And her actions over the past three and a half years, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=332.98s)]
*  that's all we need to know about her belief [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=335.82s)]
*  in our system and our sovereignty. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  If stopping fentanyl at the border was a priority, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=341.6s)]
*  other nations would have been put on notice by Kamala Harris. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=343.5s)]
*  Mexico would have been warned of dire trade consequences, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  as they were under Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=349.38000000000005s)]
*  If it didn't, you know, like stopping human trafficking, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=351.88000000000005s)]
*  is that a priority for her? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=354.92s)]
*  If they really cared about children [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  that they now use as pawns, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  they would have kept Remain in Mexico in place. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  But instead, on day one, Joe and Kamala dismantled [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=364.72s)]
*  every effective Trump border policy that was in place [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  and that kept America safe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=373.2s)]
*  And by the way, I got to say this again. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=375.98s)]
*  The idiotic so-called bipartisan border bill [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=378.06s)]
*  that Jim Langford and company tried to ram through, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  that died in the Senate, and Harris loves to cite this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=385.66s)]
*  It was such a farce that its only sponsors released it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  on, you know, 48 hours notice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=392.1s)]
*  It was 370 pages long, by the way. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=394.54s)]
*  Right before the vote, they finally released the text. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=397.6s)]
*  And all you need to know about that legislation, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=401.18s)]
*  again, that Kamala Harris will cite, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=403.0s)]
*  is it gave CBP a paltry $7 billion in additional funding. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=405.36s)]
*  Ukraine got 60 billion in the so-called border bill. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=411.36s)]
*  So Americans are tired of butt-covering politicians [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=416.48s)]
*  in both parties, we know that, they want solutions. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  And in stark contrast to Harris's last-minute [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=421.88s)]
*  border choreography that we're gonna watch tonight, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=424.1s)]
*  Donald Trump is appealing to the pragmatic core [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=427.34s)]
*  of American voters. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=430.26s)]
*  I will send Congress a bill to ban sanctuary cities [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=432.26s)]
*  in the first day that I become president. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=436.82s)]
*  I will end catch and release, and I will restore, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=440.76s)]
*  remain in Mexico. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=444.7s)]
*  We will seal the border, we will stop the invasion, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=446.34s)]
*  and we will begin the largest deportation of criminals. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=450.08s)]
*  And he will. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  Immigration should be to our national benefit. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=456.3s)]
*  It should not be used as a political strategy [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  to juice the voter rolls or as a source of cheap labor [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  to drive down American wages. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=464.3s)]
*  So we can't expect Americans to keep opening up [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=466.8s)]
*  their wallets to protect the world [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=468.76s)]
*  when leaders refuse to protect us at home. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=470.24s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=472.86s)]
*  Fox News alert, Kamala Harris is about to speak [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=474.14s)]
*  near the border, we'll take you there live when it happens. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=476.94s)]
*  I was Kamala Harris, you know, coming out [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=481.44s)]
*  and basically saying I'm a big border hawk. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  She had her nice jacket on, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=489.48s)]
*  this is her big border security speech she's about to give. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=490.92s)]
*  She just let in 10 million illegals. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=497.2s)]
*  Half of them were convicted criminals. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=499.32s)]
*  That means about 5% of the Biden-Harris migrants are ex-cons. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=502.64s)]
*  And Biden-Harris have no idea where they are. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=507.96s)]
*  They let in 13,000 convicted murderers [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=510.8s)]
*  and lost track of them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=514.26s)]
*  They let in 15,000 convicted rapists and now they're gone. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=515.6s)]
*  I always assumed when an illegal was caught [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=520.28s)]
*  by border patrol and they did a background check [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=521.96s)]
*  and they found out the guy was a convicted murderer, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=524.9s)]
*  they'd immediately detain them and deport them, but no. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=527.68s)]
*  I had no idea Biden-Harris were catching convicted killers [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  and letting them loose into the country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=534.12s)]
*  Oh, you murdered your brother? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=536.84s)]
*  Here's a court date in five years [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=538.52s)]
*  and for your asylum hearing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=540.08s)]
*  Take this free phone, get on that plane. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=542.2800000000001s)]
*  I hope you like New York. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=544.32s)]
*  Oh, you raped a kid? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=546.52s)]
*  Here's a free sandwich, a free sex change [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  and a bus ticket to Houston. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=549.64s)]
*  These people aren't seeking asylum. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  We should be seeking asylum from them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=553.76s)]
*  Trump says, I told you so. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=556.52s)]
*  Some egghead maybe said, oh, it's wonderful [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  to release people and that sounds so nice. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=561.12s)]
*  We're releasing migrants into our country [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  but these are killers. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=566.32s)]
*  These are people at the highest level of killing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=567.88s)]
*  They'd cut your throat and they won't even think about it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=570.7600000000001s)]
*  the next morning. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  These are convicted people for life are now in our country [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=575.36s)]
*  and I can finally look at them and see, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=580.2s)]
*  I say, I told you so to the fake news. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=584.2600000000001s)]
*  What Kamala Harris has done is unforgivable. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=587.6s)]
*  It's a crime what she did. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=591.08s)]
*  It's gotta be criminal. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=592.44s)]
*  There's no greater act of disloyalty [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=594.92s)]
*  than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=597.4s)]
*  and that's what she's done. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=600.68s)]
*  She's ruined our nation. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=602.0999999999999s)]
*  She's ruined our nation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=603.6999999999999s)]
*  And the media called Trump a liar [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=605.8s)]
*  for saying countries were emptying their prisons. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=607.56s)]
*  Well, where do you think a half a million ex-cons [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  came from, the gym? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=612.88s)]
*  The fact that they impeached him over a phone call [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=614.76s)]
*  while Biden Harris are processing rapists and murderers [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=617.52s)]
*  into the country. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  How is that not high crimes and misdemeanors? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  So along with the 300,000 migrant kids they lost, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=624.92s)]
*  Biden Harris lost tens of thousands of migrant killers [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  and rapists and the whole time they said [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  the border was secure. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=635.64s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=637.64s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=638.88s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=648.64s)]
*  Democrats say Trump's dangerous. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=652.08s)]
*  How? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=655.24s)]
*  Because Kamala Harris is importing convicted murderers [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=656.62s)]
*  and rapists into America and then lying about it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  She's the most dangerous presidential nominee [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=664.24s)]
*  in the history of American politics. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  She's created a geyser of sex trafficking, crime, addiction [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=668.88s)]
*  that'll impact America for decades. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  And she never went to the border once. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=676.36s)]
*  But decided to go today of all days, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=679.48s)]
*  a month before the election. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=681.24s)]
*  I'm sure it has nothing to do with the election. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=682.32s)]
*  Kamala is in the Tucson sector of Arizona tonight, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=684.92s)]
*  the epicenter of her crisis. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=687.92s)]
*  Look at how Biden Harris blew open the border in Tucson [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=690.28s)]
*  after it was under control. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=693.12s)]
*  And now she's there for a photo op on the eve of the election [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  and look how staged this border visit is. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=699.24s)]
*  This wasn't about her seeing anything with her own eyes [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=702.38s)]
*  or learning the truth about illegal immigration. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=705.8s)]
*  This was about getting the right shot of her walking [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=708.48s)]
*  along the border wall with border patrol agents, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=712.04s)]
*  if we can show that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  A wall she said she doesn't even believe in. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=716.32s)]
*  Border patrol agents who she falsely accused of whipping. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=720.14s)]
*  Remember? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=723.48s)]
*  She said they were whipping Haitians. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=723.98s)]
*  Now no one else will show you these scenes we're showing you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=726.12s)]
*  But what you're looking at is a frenzy of Harris staffers [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=728.84s)]
*  wrangling photographers to get the perfect picture, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=732.84s)]
*  as fast as possible, so they can all [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=735.96s)]
*  get the hell out of there and just say they visited the border. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=737.82s)]
*  Kamala was only actually at the border from 6 11 PM to 6 30 PM, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=741.0600000000001s)]
*  less than 20 minutes. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=746.9000000000001s)]
*  That's not visiting the border. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=748.94s)]
*  That's just a photo op. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=750.1400000000001s)]
*  The cameras weren't even allowed to get the audio of her walk [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=751.82s)]
*  and talk with the agents, so we have no idea what was discussed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=754.62s)]
*  She never even addressed the press. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=758.9000000000001s)]
*  It was like she walked the runway and went backstage. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=761.98s)]
*  She was just there to show off her border outfit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=765.5s)]
*  And before her big border security speech, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=768.5s)]
*  which we've been waiting for for four years, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=770.7s)]
*  they had a wacky woman warming up the crowd. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=773.22s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=775.74s)]
*  I came all the way from California, heard a, woo hoo! [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=776.58s)]
*  That's right! [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=780.26s)]
*  That's right! [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=781.26s)]
*  Let me hear it! [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=782.26s)]
*  Let me hear it! [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=783.26s)]
*  She's driving in any minute now, and I [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=786.46s)]
*  want her to hear you in the car. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=789.26s)]
*  So what do we say? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=790.78s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=791.9s)]
*  Kamala! [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=793.78s)]
*  Kamala! [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=795.26s)]
*  Kamala! [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=796.74s)]
*  Kamala! [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=798.22s)]
*  Hit your feet! [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=799.6999999999999s)]

*  but never did when she had the chance. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=824.3s)]
*  She says it's time for a strong border. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=826.66s)]
*  Well, why hasn't she done it? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=828.9s)]
*  She stopped Trump's border wall and then sold [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=830.5s)]

*  She ended Remain in Mexico. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=835.02s)]
*  She brought back Catch and Release [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=837.02s)]

*  Less than 1%. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=843.78s)]
*  If she wants to stop illegal immigration, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=845.58s)]
*  she should stop flying them into the country. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=847.62s)]
*  She claims the border crossing numbers are down. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=850.46s)]
*  She's just not counting the migrants. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=853.4200000000001s)]
*  She's flying here and sending to the ports of entry [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  so they can break into the country with their border app. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=858.9000000000001s)]

*  if they're just going to keep catching and releasing people? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=870.86s)]

*  The cartels quadrupled their cash flow under Harris. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=895.22s)]

*  I've never had one conversation with the president [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=909.22s)]

*  She's actually promising mass amnesty [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  instead of mass deportations. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=936.38s)]

*  Kamala went to Europe before she went to the border. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=973.74s)]

*  in danger for political power. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=989.98s)]
*  Mass migration would lead to mass amnesty, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=992.54s)]
*  which would lead to a massive amount of new Democrat voters [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=995.86s)]
*  and congressional power. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=999.38s)]

*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1018.02s)]
*  This Friday night we start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1018.94s)]
*  Three US warships were attacked tonight [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1021.34s)]
*  while entering the Red Sea. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1024.22s)]
*  The American vessels were forced to intercept nearly two dozen [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1025.8200000000002s)]
*  missiles and drones launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1029.14s)]
*  rebel militants. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1033.54s)]
*  We have a full report on this coming up with Trey [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1035.0600000000002s)]
*  Yanks straight ahead. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1037.02s)]
*  Also tonight, three individuals with ties to Iran [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1037.9s)]
*  have been indicted in a plot against Donald Trump. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1041.5s)]
*  Also, Israel just delivered a massive major blow [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1045.26s)]
*  against the Ebola terrorists deep inside Beirut. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1048.78s)]
*  And coming up, Trey Yanks reports on all of it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1052.46s)]
*  He's on the ground in Israel tonight. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1054.82s)]
*  But first, our top story. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1057.02s)]
*  With only 39 days until this inflection point of our country, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1058.54s)]
*  and that means the election, and nearly four years [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1062.26s)]
*  into her role as border czar, Kamala Harris [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1064.94s)]
*  has now figured out and pretending she knows [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1068.3s)]
*  that she cares and has solutions for the crisis [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1070.74s)]
*  of her own doing that she created [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1073.7s)]
*  at the border with Joe Biden. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1075.5s)]
*  Now, of course, this is all an act. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1077.42s)]
*  Her statements were obscene, absurd, dishonest, fake, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1079.82s)]
*  phony, fraudulent, and we're watching and witnessing [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1082.98s)]
*  one of the most dishonest presidential campaigns [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1086.42s)]
*  in American history, all aided and abetted [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1089.18s)]
*  by a complicit and abusively biased media. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1091.7s)]
*  Tonight's trip to the border reeks of nothing [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1095.1399999999999s)]
*  but political desperation. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1097.26s)]
*  But according to Kamala, she has finally [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1099.06s)]
*  found after three and a half plus long years of looking [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1101.02s)]
*  the root cause of illegal immigration, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1105.06s)]
*  and she knows how to fix it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1107.98s)]
*  Although she wants more bureaucrats to process [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1110.5400000000002s)]
*  more fake asylum claims to allow more illegal immigrants [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1112.5400000000002s)]
*  into the country. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1116.02s)]
*  Oh, that's a genius idea. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1117.18s)]
*  And one more agent for every five miles. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1119.1000000000001s)]
*  What a genius. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1121.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1122.5400000000002s)]
*  So I've just come from visiting the border [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1123.9s)]
*  in the Port of Entry in Douglas. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1126.1000000000001s)]
*  I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1128.0600000000002s)]
*  and customs officers who every day see the overflow [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1131.3000000000002s)]
*  of commercial traffic through the port. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1137.06s)]
*  These men and women who work there [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1139.58s)]
*  and at other places along our southern border [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1141.3s)]
*  help keep our nation secure. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1144.54s)]
*  And they need more resources to do their jobs. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1147.3s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1151.6599999999999s)]
*  But she'd been telling us for three and a half years, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1152.6599999999999s)]
*  no, the border's secure, the border's secure. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1154.5s)]
*  In other words, she wants the federal government [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1157.18s)]
*  to facilitate an even greater volume [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1158.8999999999999s)]
*  of illegal immigrants quickly dumping them [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1162.02s)]
*  into your town, your city, all across the country [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1164.7s)]
*  without all the burdensome chaotic scenes of the border. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1167.74s)]
*  That is her plan pretty much in a nutshell. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1171.82s)]
*  Not only will it not work, it is completely insane. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1173.98s)]
*  Which brings us to a quick Hannity history lesson, shall we? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1177.02s)]
*  Four years ago, Kamala Harris inherited [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1180.46s)]
*  the most secure border on record. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1182.74s)]
*  And as President Donald Trump made it a top priority [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1185.06s)]
*  to implement enhanced security measures. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1188.14s)]
*  He's called racist and all sorts of names for doing so. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1190.74s)]
*  But that included miles and miles of new border wall, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1194.06s)]
*  new funding for border patrol, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1197.42s)]
*  critical diplomatic agreements with multiple countries, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1199.5s)]
*  especially Mexico, the state of Mexico policy [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1203.1s)]

*  Joe Biden and Kamala, they repealed [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1212.94s)]

*  and got rid of the materials for pennies on the dollar. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1227.34s)]
*  Leaving millions of dollars worth of materials [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1230.74s)]

*  Almost overnight, the border went from completely safe [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1236.1s)]
*  and secure to a full blown crisis, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1239.1s)]
*  the likes of which this country has never seen. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1242.1399999999999s)]

*  no documentation, no identification. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1272.82s)]

*  another 222,000 pending criminal charges. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1440.14s)]

*  She's the borders are, she left these people in [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1446.66s)]
*  and make no mistake. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1450.42s)]
*  This is beyond the dereliction of duty. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1452.46s)]

*  domestic security failure in the history of this country. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1459.46s)]

*  be victims of violent crime? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1472.6200000000001s)]
*  The answer, unfortunately, is pretty simple, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1474.98s)]
*  is that Kamala represents a dangerous mix of radicalism, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1477.66s)]
*  extremism and utter complete stupidity and incompetence. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1481.82s)]

*  she never even really believed in the concept [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1488.54s)]

*  That's correct. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1504.06s)]

*  For the commander in chief to suggest [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1595.18s)]
*  that we have to build a wall across our southern border [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1599.0600000000002s)]
*  because there are terrorists [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1602.42s)]
*  who are trying to invade the country, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1604.26s)]
*  it couldn't be farther from the truth. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1608.3s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1610.5s)]
*  let's be perfectly clear. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1612.54s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1615.1s)]
*  is not going to stop them. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1618.58s)]
*  I believe if someone crosses over the border, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1620.1s)]
*  it's illegally, it is illegal, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1621.6999999999998s)]
*  and you would decriminalize it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1623.26s)]
*  I would not make it a crime punishable by jail. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1624.98s)]
*  It should be a civil enforcement issue. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1631.06s)]
*  that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1632.5s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1636.1399999999999s)]
*  and the work it is doing, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1637.98s)]
*  and we need to probably think about starting from scratch. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1638.9399999999998s)]
*  We have murderers, we have rapists, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1642.42s)]
*  we have people with known terror ties, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1644.1000000000001s)]
*  we have gangs, we have drug traffickers, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1646.8200000000002s)]
*  all that she has let in. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1649.46s)]
*  Oh, and we have Iranian assassins [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1650.66s)]
*  looking to kill Donald Trump. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1652.2600000000002s)]
*  As borders are, when Kamala's radical policies [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1653.8600000000001s)]
*  led to a full-blown crisis, she lied straight to your face. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1656.5800000000002s)]
*  She acted like it's not happening. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1660.9s)]
*  The border's secure. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1662.38s)]
*  She looked at scenes like the ones [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1663.8200000000002s)]
*  you're looking at right there and flat out told you, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1665.7s)]
*  no, this isn't happening, the border is secure. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1668.5400000000002s)]
*  She told you over and over again. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1672.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1674.06s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1675.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1677.98s)]
*  what the president and I asked Congress to do [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1682.1399999999999s)]
*  is the first request we made, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1684.74s)]
*  pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1687.6999999999998s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1693.4599999999998s)]
*  You're confident this border's secure? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1694.58s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1697.54s)]
*  for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1704.3s)]
*  For three and a half years, she flat out refused [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1708.6599999999999s)]
*  to even visit the southern border as borders are [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  to see the crisis up close and personal and firsthand. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1714.22s)]
*  After all, why go to the border? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1717.94s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1719.8999999999999s)]
*  If you haven't been to Europe, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1721.42s)]
*  why would you go to the border? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1722.82s)]
*  You decide. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1725.4599999999998s)]
*  The notion that the border is closed, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1727.54s)]
*  why should they believe you when they know [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1730.1s)]
*  that people are getting in? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1732.1s)]
*  Well Lester, here's the thing. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1733.9399999999998s)]
*  I've been working on this issue for a very long time. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1736.06s)]
*  Do you have any plans to visit the border? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1739.58s)]
*  I'm here in Guatemala today at some point. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1743.7399999999998s)]
*  We are going to the border. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1749.02s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1750.1s)]
*  So this whole thing about the border, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1751.5s)]
*  we've been to the border. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1754.82s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  You haven't been to the border. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1757.46s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1759.62s)]
*  And I don't understand the point that you're making. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1761.58s)]
*  I haven't been to Europe either. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1768.6599999999999s)]
*  Europe, get ready, she's probably on her way. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1770.46s)]
*  After lying about the border crisis for years, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1772.82s)]
*  pretending it wasn't a real crisis, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1775.06s)]
*  terrible poll numbers now finally force [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1777.8999999999999s)]
*  Kamala to switch tactics with 39 days to go to election day. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1780.5s)]
*  Of course, she wasn't actually willing to put in the work [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1784.3400000000001s)]
*  to fix the wide open southern border. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1787.02s)]
*  Instead, she tried to blame or pass the blame. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1789.14s)]
*  Actually blame Donald Trump, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1792.3400000000001s)]
*  who gave her the most secure border in history. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1794.3400000000001s)]
*  But when all else fails and the dog bites [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1796.78s)]
*  and the bee stings and you're feeling sad [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1800.1000000000001s)]
*  and you left the border wide open, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1802.3400000000001s)]
*  just blame Trump, easy. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1804.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1806.58s)]
*  We do have a broken immigration system [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1807.9s)]
*  and it needs to be fixed. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1810.7800000000002s)]
*  And if we take a step back, months ago, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1812.0600000000002s)]
*  some of the most conservative members [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1814.7s)]
*  of the United States Congress came together with others, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1816.3400000000001s)]
*  proposed a border security bill. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1819.1000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump got word of the bill, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1821.26s)]
*  realized it was gonna fix a problem he wanted to run on [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1823.7s)]
*  and told them to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1826.46s)]
*  He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1829.26s)]
*  because he wants to run on a problem [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1831.38s)]
*  instead of fixing a problem. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1833.18s)]
*  Okay, let me, this lie needs to be debunked. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1835.78s)]
*  This was never a border security bill, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1839.34s)]
*  one of the dumbest bills in history. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1842.26s)]
*  It was blocked by Senate Republicans [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1844.26s)]
*  because it did nothing to secure the border. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1846.18s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it wouldn't even kick in [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1848.8999999999999s)]
*  until four or 5,000 illegals actually crossed [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1850.78s)]
*  into the country illegally. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1853.54s)]
*  And then they had the discretion, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1855.02s)]
*  whether to enforce it or not, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1856.54s)]
*  which would codify what they've been doing into law. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1858.26s)]
*  It enabled, it encouraged the illegal immigration [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1861.26s)]
*  by reducing wait times at the border for illegals. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1864.22s)]
*  So again, codified open borders into law. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1867.74s)]
*  That was not a border security bill. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1871.3s)]
*  Now the photo op in Douglas, Arizona today [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1873.46s)]
*  is nothing but a slap in the face to every American. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1876.02s)]
*  It's like a criminal returning to the scene of a crime [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1879.26s)]
*  and the residents of this border town, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1882.3400000000001s)]
*  not exactly happy with Kamala's visit. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1884.8600000000001s)]
*  Sarah Carter recently spoke with some of the locals [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1887.3400000000001s)]
*  right there on the ground that have been dealing [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1890.5800000000002s)]
*  with the truth for three and a half years. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1892.94s)]
*  Let's listen to what they have to say. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1895.5s)]
*  We have the vice president coming in today. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1898.06s)]
*  Why do you think she's here? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1901.3400000000001s)]
*  Because she's the flip-flopper [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1903.66s)]
*  and she's trying to get some votes at the last minute. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1905.38s)]
*  Where was she three and a half, four years ago? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1908.54s)]
*  How do you feel about vice president [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1910.66s)]
*  Kamala Harris's visit here today? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1912.22s)]
*  I'd like to be over in her face. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1915.3400000000001s)]
*  What would you tell her? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1917.5800000000002s)]
*  I'd say, it's about time you visited the border. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1918.78s)]
*  Let me show you what it's really like. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1921.8600000000001s)]
*  It's all publicity. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1924.06s)]
*  It's kind of like she's here. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1927.1000000000001s)]
*  She doesn't care. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1930.7s)]
*  She just cares about winning. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1932.42s)]
*  Why do you think she's here? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1934.5800000000002s)]
*  Politics, of course. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1936.78s)]
*  So you're not being fooled? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1938.94s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1940.5s)]
*  I mean, she's had what, three and a half, four years [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1942.26s)]
*  to do something of some consequences [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1944.7s)]
*  and hasn't done anything [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1949.06s)]
*  and I don't think she's gonna do anything [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1950.5s)]
*  but carry on another word, solid, I guess. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1952.7s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement just released a report [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=1955.94s)]

*  what we've known for a while, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2423.54s)]
*  that the more you hear from her, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2424.8199999999997s)]
*  the more you understand why the left [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2426.38s)]
*  doesn't want you to hear from her. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2427.94s)]
*  Check out her greatest hits from Wednesday night. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2430.22s)]
*  Well, but we're gonna have to raise corporate taxes, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2433.5s)]
*  and we're gonna have to raise, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2437.06s)]
*  we're gonna have to make sure that the biggest corporations [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2440.1s)]
*  and billionaires pay their fair share. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2443.94s)]
*  That's just it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2446.3399999999997s)]
*  Looking holistically at the connection [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  between that and housing, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2449.96s)]
*  and looking holistically at the incentives [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2452.22s)]
*  we in the federal government can create [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2454.5s)]
*  for local and state governments [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2456.1s)]
*  to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  Just wanna ask you yes or no. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2460.7s)]
*  At any point in your life, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2462.1s)]
*  have you served two all beef patties, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2463.98s)]
*  special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2466.74s)]
*  on a sesame seed bun, working at a McDonald's? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2469.42s)]
*  Yes or no, that's it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2471.94s)]
*  I have. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2472.98s)]
*  Sure you have, Kamala. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2474.54s)]
*  And Brian Stelter just opened a 24-hour health club. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2476.42s)]
*  You know, I love how she never says [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2481.3399999999997s)]
*  where this McDonald's was. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2483.06s)]
*  You want lies with that, Jake? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2485.52s)]
*  At least working with Biden [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2487.9s)]
*  has taught her what a number two is. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2489.06s)]
*  And it's not a cheeseburger combo. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2493.1s)]
*  But the interview was such a disaster, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2496.0s)]
*  even the New York Times couldn't spin it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2497.54s)]
*  They tore Kamala's interview apart [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2500.06s)]
*  like their view gnawing through a platter [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2501.7s)]
*  of pulled pork sandwiches. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2503.62s)]
*  Here's this quote. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2506.54s)]
*  "'Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2507.58s)]
*  "'and predictable questions with roundabout responses [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2509.8399999999997s)]
*  "'that did not provide a substantive answer.'" [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2512.8199999999997s)]
*  Or this. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2515.7799999999997s)]
*  "'A hard-hitting Harris interview is still yet to come.' [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2516.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2519.02s)]
*  Or this. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2520.06s)]
*  "'It's not quite clear what Ms. Harris gained [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2520.9s)]
*  "'aside from giving her campaign aides the ability [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2522.84s)]
*  "'to say she held a one-on-one cable television interview.'" [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2525.1s)]
*  Now that may sound mild to you, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2529.06s)]
*  but for the Times, that's them losing [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2530.6600000000003s)]
*  their collective. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2532.98s)]
*  Even they knew that when she talked, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2535.02s)]
*  she made a ball of yarn sound like Socrates. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2537.38s)]
*  Hell, Kamala's so bad these days, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2541.7400000000002s)]
*  it's driving some at the UN to drink. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2543.38s)]
*  ["The Man Who Killed the World"] [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2547.08s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2550.08s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2552.92s)]
*  That was the transitional leader of Haiti, Edgar LeBlanc. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2557.6s)]
*  No relation to Matt. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2561.92s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2563.4s)]
*  I want to see it again. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2566.0s)]
*  ["The Man Who Killed the World"] [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2568.08s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2571.3199999999997s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2572.16s)]
*  I'd say someone get that man a plastic straw. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2574.6s)]
*  Too bad they're banned. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  So while they push Harris on us [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2578.64s)]
*  like a reverse mortgage on a timeshare, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2580.2s)]
*  they also tried to hide who she really is. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2582.48s)]
*  It's a catch-22. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2584.72s)]
*  We're witnessing an election version [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2586.16s)]
*  of hiding the kids' presents until Christmas morning, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  except the gifts are a pile of rap manure [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2590.96s)]
*  and the parents of the Democratic Party in the media. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2593.48s)]
*  It's the total opposite with Donald Trump. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2596.2s)]
*  Sure, he says a lot of stuff, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2598.68s)]
*  but within that he breezily offers pointed specifics. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2600.68s)]
*  And I'll take that over this game of hide and seek. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2604.24s)]
*  Go ahead, ask him if he will settle the war in Ukraine [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2607.7999999999997s)]
*  and he will end the chaos in the Middle East. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  I will settle the war in Ukraine [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2614.48s)]
*  and I will end the chaos in the Middle East [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2616.68s)]
*  and I will prevent something [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2618.68s)]
*  that nobody else will be able to do. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2620.12s)]
*  I will prevent World War III. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2622.52s)]
*  Do you think Biden lies awake at night [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2624.3999999999996s)]
*  thinking how are we gonna get Europe to pay? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  No, he goes to sleep. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2629.56s)]
*  Here's a guy can sleep on the beach. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2631.52s)]
*  How do you sleep on the beach when you have cameras on? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2633.36s)]
*  I will never sleep on the beach [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2637.64s)]
*  in front of live television, I promise. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2640.12s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2642.7599999999998s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2643.6s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2644.44s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2645.2799999999997s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2646.1s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2646.94s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2647.7799999999997s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2648.6s)]
*  I promise. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2649.44s)]
*  Has anyone ever promised that before? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2650.2799999999997s)]
*  Has anyone ever had to? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2653.96s)]
*  He's pointing out that not only [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2656.44s)]
*  does the emperor have no clothes, he has no empire. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2657.96s)]
*  All he has is a beach umbrella [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2661.64s)]
*  and memories of corn pop and cannibalism. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2663.2s)]
*  So you got a candidate in Harris who says nothing [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2666.7200000000003s)]
*  and means even less and you got Trump [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2669.4s)]
*  who will say whatever he wants [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2671.8s)]
*  but tells you exactly what he thinks, take it or leave it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2673.2400000000002s)]
*  For a meeting that depends, demands transparency, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2676.12s)]
*  it's the biggest hypocrisy of all. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2680.36s)]
*  They pick the candidate who won't reveal her plans [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2682.4s)]
*  perhaps because they know how bad they could be. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2685.56s)]
*  Right, Joe? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2689.2s)]
*  As vice president, there wasn't a single thing [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2690.4s)]
*  that I did that she couldn't do. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2692.92s)]
*  And so I was able to delegate her responsibility [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2695.6s)]
*  on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2698.24s)]
*  That's what you call a sick burn. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2701.36s)]
*  As the Harris campaign tries to find daylight [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2704.64s)]
*  between their crummy candidate [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2706.68s)]
*  and the past four years of hell, Joe says, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2708.16s)]
*  hold on kids, she was with me every step of the way [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2710.28s)]
*  from Afghanistan to the border. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2713.44s)]
*  Maybe he's not so demented after all. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVhNaJtrLk&t=2716.0s)]
