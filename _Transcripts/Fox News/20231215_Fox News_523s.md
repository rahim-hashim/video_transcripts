# Americans have ‘wised up’ to Biden’s lies: Gregg Jarrett
**Fox News:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA)
*  Here to explain all that evolution, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=0.0s)]
*  Jason Chaffetz and the host of Tommy Lahren is Fearless on Outkick. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=5.4s)]
*  Tommy Lahren is with us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=10.36s)]
*  How did we start with, you know, all the times Joe Biden said, I never once discussed the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=11.84s)]
*  foreign business deals with my son, my brother or anybody else for that matter, how did we [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=18.2s)]
*  start there? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  How did it then become the president was never in business with his son? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=24.88s)]
*  How did it evolve even further? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=29.02s)]
*  My father was not financially involved in the business. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=30.5s)]
*  You know, can you explain the evolution? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=33.54s)]
*  Because I think I have a pretty good handle on it, Greg Jarrett, and that is that with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=37.88s)]
*  each new piece of information that the House Oversight Committee or Judiciary Committee [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=41.7s)]
*  or Ways and Means Committee came up with, they had to come out with an excuse to explain [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=46.7s)]
*  away the previous lie. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=51.94s)]
*  Is that a good theory on my part? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=53.56s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=55.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=57.22s)]
*  And, you know, Joe Biden continues to double down on his lies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=58.22s)]
*  And nearly 70 percent of Americans don't believe it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=62.14s)]
*  They think he either committed actions that are illegal or unethical. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, Americans have wised up to Joe Biden's lies and the allegations against [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=70.5s)]
*  him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=76.22s)]
*  You know, Sean, they're serious and credible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=77.22s)]
*  There's compelling evidence of impeachable conduct. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  He actively aided and abetted corrupt schemes operated by his son, netting tens of millions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=81.72s)]
*  of dollars from foreign interests while selling access and promises of influence. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=88.4s)]
*  There's documents and testimonies that implicate the father as complicit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=93.72s)]
*  And so, you know, exploiting a public office to enrich your family, even if you don't profit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  yourself. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=105.8s)]
*  That's both a criminal offense, Sean, and it's an impeachable one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=107.08s)]
*  Well, Tommy, let's get your take on this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=111.76s)]
*  I mean, to me, it's a slam-dunk case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=113.68s)]
*  But if you listen to the media mob, if you listen to the Democratic Party, they just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=116.4s)]
*  don't seem to care very much, do they? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=121.08s)]
*  They don't seem to care, but I believe that they actually do care. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=124.88s)]
*  They're just hoping that the American people won't catch on, because up until now, the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=128.16s)]
*  American voter hasn't seemingly really cared about this corruption, the bribery scheme. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=132.0s)]
*  But it's up to House Republicans, it's up to Republicans in general, to hammer this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=136.76s)]
*  point home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=140.16s)]
*  Republicans cannot sit on the fence on this issue, on the impeachment inquiry, on questioning [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=141.32s)]
*  Hunter Biden, holding him in contempt. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=145.92s)]
*  Republicans have to go hard, harder than ever, because they have to set a precedent. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=148.8s)]
*  For too long, Republicans have slow-walked this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=152.76s)]
*  They didn't want to be the ones that held firm on their word, didn't want to go after [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=155.64s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, have kind of soft-pedaled their pursuit of Joe and Hunter Biden. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=159.44s)]
*  They have to go hard. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  This is their opportunity. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=166.22s)]
*  Set a precedent, show the American people that you have a backbone and a spine, and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=167.48s)]
*  end this once and for all. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  You've got the evidence. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  Now's time to hit this one home. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=174.44s)]
*  I believe they can do it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=176.0s)]
*  But to all the spineless Republicans that don't want to enter this fight, now is the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  time to fight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  Grow some fangs and get ready to go to war here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=182.2s)]
*  You know, Jason, you've been involved in investigations like this in the past, in your years in Congress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=184.72s)]
*  What is your take as you stand back and you look at all the evidence and everything all [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  three of the committees have been able to find? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  What is your take? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=199.36s)]
*  And how far do you think this goes? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=200.36s)]
*  Because I really believe, with the Republicans yesterday going forward with the impeachment [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=202.56s)]
*  inquiry, that this now is a very serious and clear and present danger to Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=207.52s)]
*  I totally agree with you, Sean. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=214.84s)]
*  I think it's also an indictment on the Department of Justice. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  I think part of the reason that the media covered it up and didn't cover it is that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  they knew Attorney General Garland and his henchmen there were not going to charge him, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=225.0s)]
*  if not for that judge who stepped up and kind of broke apart this plea deal. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=230.6s)]
*  All of this was going to be pushed aside. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=235.28s)]
*  And as Chairman Jim Jordan has highlighted, you know, why did they let the statutes of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=237.32s)]
*  limitations expire? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=243.28s)]
*  This is all the Department of Justice is doing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=244.88s)]
*  They knew that they were going to go ahead and let this guy off and Joe Biden could just [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=247.64s)]
*  wash his hands of it and move on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=252.28s)]
*  So, yeah, the charges are serious because you have a president of the United States [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=254.4s)]
*  who is potentially compromised by our very adversaries such as China. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  And we got to get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Department of Justice isn't going to do it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=266.56s)]
*  Republicans in the House have to do it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=269.12s)]
*  Jason, what does it mean? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=270.56s)]
*  Why is this inquiry so important, this vote yesterday so important, especially in terms [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=271.72s)]
*  of all the stonewalling that has been going on? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, Congress should be able to go ahead and issue a subpoena and have that enforced. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=281.48s)]
*  But if you're going to go to the courts to force the extraction of documents, compel [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=287.04s)]
*  the attendance of the witnesses, it is stronger to have a full vote of the House to have that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  impeachment inquiry. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  It is totally a legal strategy because it will probably end up in the courts and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=297.86s)]
*  courts have got to back you up in order to do it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  That vote made it that much stronger. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=305.24s)]
*  Greg, do you agree with that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=306.68s)]
*  Yeah, I absolutely do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=309.52s)]
*  And I can't overstate how utterly idiotic it was for Hunter Biden to hold a press conference [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=310.88s)]
*  to brazenly defy a valid subpoena to appear for his deposition, which is routine, and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=316.48s)]
*  instead demand his own conditions, that it be a public hearing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=323.2s)]
*  He has no right under law to do that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Witnesses don't get to dictate terms. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=329.88s)]
*  Failure to comply is a crime. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=331.92s)]
*  So legally, Hunter made the case against himself and politically, I think it backfired, fueling [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=334.76s)]
*  the need for the House vote. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=341.84s)]
*  But even worse, if Joe Biden conferred with his son as the White House suggests and encouraged [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  him to commit a crime by defying the subpoena, well, that's another basis for impeachment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=348.68s)]
*  It's called, Sean, obstruction. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=355.24s)]
*  You know, Tommy, I look at this and I know you've worked very hard in your career, as [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=357.76s)]
*  Greg has, as Jason has, as we all have. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=361.92s)]
*  What do you like a gig where if your dad was president and you had no experience at all, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=364.68s)]
*  that you'd make millions and millions of dollars? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=372.04s)]
*  Why, I'm trying to understand the lack of curiosity on the part of the media mob and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=375.48s)]
*  the left in this country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=382.36s)]
*  How is it possible that somebody with no experience can make all of that money, dad can take specific [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=384.0s)]
*  actions that ensures that you continue to get paid again with no experience and it doesn't [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  seem to raise an eyebrow in the minds of liberals. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  To them, it's like an everyday affair. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Is that the ordinary way that people do business that maybe I've not learned yet? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=404.64s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this, Sean. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=408.96s)]
*  I have never had my father sit on any of my business calls or my personal calls or any [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm not sure that my dad has the power of a vice president or a sitting president, so [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=418.36s)]
*  maybe that's where it's different. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=423.72s)]
*  But you just saw earlier today the ladies, and I use the word ladies very loosely, of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=425.04s)]
*  the view coming to Joe and Hunter's cover once again, passing this off as a father's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=429.64s)]
*  love saying that other people, pointing the finger at Meghan McCain, by the way, pointing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=434.24s)]
*  the finger at her as if she has done the same thing, which is obviously false, a lie and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=438.6s)]
*  erroneous, but they will continue to do this in the media, make it seem like this is just [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=443.04s)]
*  how Washington works. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  That's why it's up to Republicans to show that this is not how Washington works. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=448.44s)]
*  This will not be acceptable. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=451.8s)]
*  And they have to go hard and take this thing through to the end to show the American people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=453.48s)]
*  that Republicans are serious about this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  And these people will be brought to justice. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=459.92s)]
*  DOJ be damned, Biden White House be damned. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  This has got to go forward and it has to go all the way to the end. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Greg, legal question on what Tommy just brought up, and that has to do with Meghan McCain. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=468.32000000000005s)]
*  She said she will consult with her lawyers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=472.44000000000005s)]
*  We know about Times v. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=474.72s)]
*  Sullivan. She is a public figure. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=476.32s)]
*  Do you think she may have a case against the view? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=478.4s)]
*  Well, from what I saw of the right up to the clips, they didn't mention her by name. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=482.32s)]
*  I suppose the implication was there or Meghan McCain certainly construed it that way, but [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=490.04s)]
*  she is a public figure. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=495.24s)]
*  Opinion is sometimes but not always protected speech. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=497.6s)]
*  So it would be a tough case for her to bring. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=502.64s)]
*  I predict she won't bring such a case. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=504.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, we'll see over time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zejRFjTwA&t=509.79999999999995s)]
