# James Comer: It appears the Bidens have been laundering through the term 'loan'
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc)
*  Now, as we await the release of this report, the House, they are continuing their existing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=0.0s)]
*  impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden. And according to the transcript of one witness and their [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=4.96s)]
*  interview obtained by JustTheNews.com, that's John Solomon's group, an employee of a hospital [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=10.48s)]
*  company that Joe's brother, Jim, worked with, said he had no idea at all what Jim did for the company [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=16.16s)]
*  or why he was paid. Now, another former Biden associate testified that he loaned Jim Biden [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=23.04s)]
*  $800,000, but only got half the money back, according to The Daily Caller. And the next week, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=28.48s)]
*  another one of Hunter's old business associates, Tony Bobolinski, guess what? He's going to share [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=34.96s)]
*  his story with lawmakers about the big guy here with the very latest House Oversight Committee [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=40.24s)]
*  Chairman James Comer is with us. Sir, welcome back. Let me ask you about this case. You have released [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=45.2s)]
*  the transcript of this woman. Her name is Carol Fox, the trustee who represented AmeriCorps, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=51.6s)]
*  now a bankrupt healthcare company. And she said she couldn't determine what role James Biden played [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  nor identify any paperwork backing up any loans made to him from a company struggling in 2018. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=65.44s)]
*  She's the trustee of the bankruptcy estate, and she has now sued Joe's brother, James, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=72.4s)]
*  and sued him in 2022 because he didn't repay the $600,000 in loans. And she couldn't identify the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=78.72s)]
*  services that were allegedly provided. And she found no documentary evidence for consulting or [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=85.36s)]
*  marketing at all. What's going on here? That sounds like being paid for doing nothing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=92.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there's a pattern of that, and we've been calling it influence peddling. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=98.32s)]
*  This is a perfect example. Jim Biden found out about AmeriCorps Health, a company that was a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=101.92s)]
*  distressed healthcare company that were, that was on the verge of bankruptcy. He approached them [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=107.36s)]
*  and said that because he's Joe Biden's brother, that he can go to the Middle East and use all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=113.2s)]
*  of Joe Biden's contacts and get AmeriCorps Health all the money they needed. But they needed to pay [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=119.04s)]
*  him first. And the way he wanted to be paid was through a loan. Now the company went bankrupt. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=124.56s)]
*  Jim Biden, like he normally does, never delivered on anything other than committed securities fraud [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=130.88s)]
*  with this AmeriCorps Health. And the now bankrupt company with the trustee testified, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=137.76s)]
*  they looked over everything. They saw the $600,000 that went to Jim Biden, but they can't find any [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=144.0s)]
*  loan documents and they can't find one single thing that he did to get the money. And Sean, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=149.28s)]
*  the most important thing about this for our investigation is they paid Jim Biden in increments. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  The last increment was a $200,000 payment. The exact same day, Jim Biden received that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=160.56s)]
*  $200,000 payment, he had about $4,000 in his account. So that made it $204,000. That same [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=167.04s)]
*  day he wrote a check to Joe Biden for $200,000. That proved Joe Biden benefited financially [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=173.12s)]
*  from his family's shady influence peddling scheme. Well, that's what's going to make Tony [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=180.56s)]
*  Bobulinski's deposition, I think that much more critical. Have you had any evidence in recent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=185.92s)]
*  interviews that warrant your committee to subpoena Joe's financial accounts and records, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=192.4s)]
*  his pseudonym email accounts? Have you gotten all of that information? And what about any [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  phones that he used that might've been his or maybe Rosemont Seneca's? What do you know? What [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  do we know about Joe's further involvement? And when do you get to actually get the information [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=211.68s)]
*  you've been seeking now for a long time about Joe Biden, the big guy himself? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=218.08s)]
*  Well, as you know, we've been putting this taste together. We've been taking it step by step. We've [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=224.08s)]
*  made sure every I's dotted and T's crossed. And that's why when Hunter Biden, you know, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=227.84s)]
*  had other plans for coming in, I think that's why he's now decided he's going to come in for a sit [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=234.4s)]
*  down deposition. With respect to the phone records, we've requested specific phone records. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  We've requested, as you know, the pseudonym emails and the White House continues to obstruct. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=247.76s)]
*  Sean, it looks like we're going to be headed to court very soon for a lot of things pertaining [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=253.76s)]
*  to Joe Biden. It's like they've the Biden legal team is retreated on things with Hunter that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=258.32s)]
*  we've requested. They've retreated on things with Jim Biden and other Biden family members and some [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=264.08s)]
*  of their associates. But when it comes to Joe Biden, the fort is up. They're armed. They're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=269.12s)]
*  going to do everything they can to continue this obstruction because they're obviously hiding [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=276.0s)]
*  something. Yeah. Well, I'd like to know when we're going to get that information. Let's talk about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=280.88s)]
*  upcoming video, interviews you have with James Biden, Joe's brother and with Hunter Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=286.32s)]
*  Okay. What do you expect out of those interviews and what are you looking for? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=294.08s)]
*  Well, we have a lot of questions. As you know, we have the bank records for both Hunter Biden and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=300.0s)]
*  Jim Biden, and we have a lot of questions. There are a lot of loans in there. We've already discussed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=305.12s)]
*  with Kevin Morris a few weeks ago when we interviewed him about all the loans he gave to Hunter Biden, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=311.52s)]
*  over $6 million in loans to Hunter Biden. You mentioned two loans to Jim Biden. When you were [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  introducing me, that's a million dollars to Jim Biden. We haven't found any loan documentation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=324.96s)]
*  It appears that the Bidens may have been laundering through the term loan. When you get a loan, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=331.12s)]
*  you don't have to report that on your taxes, but a loan is something you're supposed to pay back. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=338.88s)]
*  If you get a loan and you do not pay it back, then that's income. That's income in the form of either [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=342.88s)]
*  a gift of the person that loaned the money or income from the person that received the money. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=349.28s)]
*  By the way, if it's an extended period of time that you're paying back the loan, don't you buy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  as a matter of law have to charge interest? Otherwise, it's considered a gift? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=360.32s)]
*  You do. That's just another tool in the toolbox. Look, they have not produced any loan [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=367.12s)]
*  documentation. Who would loan people millions of dollars and not have a document? I mean, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=375.44s)]
*  this is classic influence peddling. This is a way they tried to deceive the IRS and subvert the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=381.76s)]
*  disclosure laws that are required for immediate family members of high ranking politicians. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=389.2s)]
*  This stinks to high heaven. We're going to continue to bring these people in. We've got [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=393.84s)]
*  Jim Biden, Hunter Biden, and Tony Bobulinski all coming in in the next three weeks. It'll be a big [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=396.88s)]
*  three weeks for the investigation. I'd like to know what the grandkids did to get the money they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=402.0s)]
*  got and where that money went. Anyway, James Comer, thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOYt_1Krc&t=407.03999999999996s)]
