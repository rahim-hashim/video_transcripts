# Sean Hannity: Trump has demonstrated we can secure our borders
**Fox News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU)
*  And welcome to Hannity this Monday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=0.0s)]
*  We start with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=4.0s)]
*  We are awaiting Donald Trump's, President Trump's arrival at Joint Base Andrews. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=5.44s)]
*  We'll take you there live as it happens. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It is now week two of the Trump administration. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=12.64s)]
*  But it would kind of take me the entire monologue and maybe the whole show to list everything [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=16.8s)]
*  that the 47th president has accomplished over the past seven days. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=21.36s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to show you how Trump is cracking down on woke insanity in our Department [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=26.4s)]
*  of Defense, plus full highlights from Vice President J.D. Vance's schooling, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  the smug legacy, state-run media mob, in this case, left-wing CBS host Margaret Brennan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=37.36s)]
*  But first, we turn to an issue that most Americans actually agree on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=43.64s)]
*  That is immigration. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=47.44s)]
*  That is law and order at our border and border security. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=48.76s)]
*  According to a new Axios poll, a whopping two-thirds of you, the American people, want [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=52.4s)]
*  illegal immigrants deported. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump made this a central part of his campaign. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=60.4s)]
*  And now, as president, he is keeping his promise to you, the American people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=68.72s)]
*  So many people came across the border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Nobody has any idea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=71.68s)]
*  I used to say, like, 325, but we really don't know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=73.68s)]
*  But we're going to know soon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=77.2s)]
*  We're going to know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=78.2s)]
*  I tell you, our people are doing a — Tom Holman and his staff are doing an incredible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=79.44s)]
*  job getting the bad ones out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=83.88s)]
*  And today, in Tijuana, you probably saw the — I got a call from Tom Holman and some [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=86.64s)]
*  of the people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=91.0s)]
*  They said, sir, it's unbelievable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=92.0s)]
*  There is nobody — you have this huge area. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a gathering area. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  It's always been packed with these people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  What they did to our country is so unbelievable. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=99.64s)]
*  That they could do this to our country is so horrible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=101.48s)]
*  But he said, there's nobody there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  You saw yesterday, we've made it clear to every country that they will be taking back [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=106.24s)]
*  our people that we're sending out, the criminals, the illegal aliens coming from their countries. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=111.56s)]
*  We're taking them back, and they're going to take them back fast. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=117.44s)]
*  And if they don't, they'll pay a very high economic price. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=120.44s)]
*  And we're going to immediately install massive tariffs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=123.28s)]
*  It will be placed on them and other sanctions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=127.16s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=133.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=134.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=135.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=136.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=137.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=138.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=139.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=140.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=141.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=142.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=143.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=144.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=145.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=146.84s)]
*  We're going to be putting them back in the country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=147.84s)]
*  We can secure our borders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=149.84s)]
*  We can hunt down these criminals. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=150.84s)]
*  We can send them packing back to their home countries, even if those countries don't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=152.52s)]
*  want them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=157.68s)]
*  As you know, over the weekend, Colombia turned away two repatriation flights full of their [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=158.68s)]
*  own citizens after initially agreeing to take them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=163.24s)]
*  President Trump, he responded immediately. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=166.84s)]
*  He halted visa services at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, threatening a massive 25 percent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=169.12s)]
*  tariff on Colombian imports that would double within a week to 50 percent. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=175.74s)]
*  And then magically, within minutes, Colombia's far-left president backed down, agreeing to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=180.86s)]
*  every one of Donald Trump's repatriation terms, even offering his own jet to assist [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=185.74s)]
*  with Donald Trump's operation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=191.46s)]
*  This is not just a huge diplomatic win for the president, but a message to the rest of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=193.74s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=198.58s)]
*  New sheriff in town. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=199.58s)]
*  The U.S. has a tremendous amount of leverage. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=200.9s)]
*  This president is not afraid to use it or its power, especially in this case, for the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=204.24s)]
*  right reason. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=209.58s)]
*  Of course, many on the left, they are not happy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=210.58s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others so deeply concerned about the price [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=213.36s)]
*  of coffee and flowers going up over sanctions that are actually needed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=219.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, singer and actress Selena Gomez filmed herself weeping today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=224.28s)]
*  She was in a, let's call it a performative fit of hysteria, because Donald Trump is deporting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=229.7s)]
*  violent criminal, illegal immigrants, people that didn't obey our laws, our borders and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=235.88s)]
*  our sovereignty. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=240.88s)]
*  Watch this, and then I have a question on the other side. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  I just want to say that I'm so sorry. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=244.6s)]
*  All my people are getting attacked. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  The children. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=259.3s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=262.3s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=265.3s)]
*  I wish I could do something that I can't. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=268.3s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=273.3s)]
*  I'll try everything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=276.3s)]
*  I promise. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=277.3s)]
*  Now, maybe Selena Gomez can answer some simple questions. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  Where were the tears and the posting for the little girl, 12-year-old girl Jocelyn Nungary, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, raped, murdered by, allegedly by two illegal immigrants from Venezuela? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Where were the tears and where were the—why weren't you crying for Laken Riley, a 22-year-old [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  nursing student, murdered on a jogging trail by another unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrant [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=302.7s)]
*  from Venezuela? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=309.9s)]
*  Where were the tears for Rachel Moore and the young mother of five raped, murdered on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  a hiking trail in Maryland, allegedly, again, by an unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrant [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=316.5s)]
*  from El Salvador, now charged with her death? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  And where were you, Selena? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=326.02s)]
*  You know, where were your tears for the thousands of Americans killed, raped, including children, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=327.76s)]
*  or assaulted by people that entered our country illegally, unvetted, under Harris and Biden? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=333.76s)]
*  Where were those tears? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=340.48s)]
*  Why didn't you make social media postings then? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=341.48s)]
*  We have been scrolling the names of victims for years on this program, but apparently [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=344.54s)]
*  in her ivory tower, you know, behind her mansion walls and private security, Selena Gomez, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=350.52s)]
*  I guess, never noticed. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=356.34s)]
*  But just so we are clear, here are just a few of the many criminals Donald Trump is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  deporting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=363.7s)]
*  For example, this is a fugitive from El Salvador with connections to terrorist organizations, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=364.98s)]
*  and this is a Haitian gang member, as you can see there on your screen, who has been [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=371.26s)]
*  charged and convicted 17 times in the past two years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=375.42s)]
*  Another recent ICE arrest was a Dominican man who beat his pregnant wife to death in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=379.38s)]
*  Colorado. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  Fifty Trent de Aragua gang members were rounded up at a makeshift nightclub. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  Other ICE raids, busting child rapists, suspected ISIS terrorists. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=391.76s)]
*  Only someone truly unhinged would have a problem with these deportations. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=396.6s)]
*  And if you've got to be angry at anybody or shed tears, shed it for the families and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=401.24s)]
*  shed it for our country, because there will be more victims—I hope I'm wrong, but I'm [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=405.24s)]
*  probably right—as a result of unvetted Harris-Biden illegals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  But anyway, right on cue, if you turn over to MSDNC, here's Nicole Wallace this time. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=414.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0OVW_yBeU&t=420.09999999999997s)]
