# We need to restore a culture of law and order: Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18)
*  True's, the future of America first, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=0.0s)]
*  What's so frustrating to me—and I always find interviews, like I did the other night [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  with Rachel Moran's mom, the hardest interviews to do, because you're interviewing people [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=10.86s)]
*  that you know are in pain, deep pain, and there's no words that you can give them [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=16.26s)]
*  that will comfort them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=20.96s)]
*  And what's so frustrating is all of this is preventable, Vivek. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=22.72s)]
*  This is not complicated. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=27.26s)]
*  We had that border secure, not perfectly, but pretty darn close, the lowest levels [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=29.44s)]
*  we'd seen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=34.84s)]
*  And Joe Biden brags about undoing all those policies that worked, and then now he wants [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=36.14s)]
*  to blame Republicans and lie again and offer amnesty. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=40.86s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, look, here is the hard truth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=45.96s)]
*  It's common sense, Sean, that if your first act of entering this country breaks the law, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=48.72s)]
*  you are more likely to continue breaking the law while you're already here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=53.88s)]
*  Take Rachel Moran, for example. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=58.12s)]
*  She was killed by an illegal migrant from El Salvador. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=59.32s)]
*  El Salvador is a country that's now cracking down on crime in their own country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=62.4s)]
*  Their president, President Bukele, is coming down hard on crime, while we're not doing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=66.36s)]
*  that in the United States of America. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=71.04s)]
*  So these are the kinds of hard truths that deserve to be exposed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=72.72s)]
*  That's why I wrote the book that's coming out this fall. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=76.2s)]
*  And even further than that, it's why we need to actually win the election this fall to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=78.12s)]
*  restore that culture of law and order in our country, move the military to the southern [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=81.72s)]
*  border, put the Coast Guard in the Rio Grande, stop funding the federal sanctuary, funding [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  for sanctuary cities, and send back the criminals who have committed crimes in this country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=90.56s)]
*  to their country of origin. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=95.36s)]
*  That's how you get the job done. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=97.2s)]
*  President Trump talks about securing our border and finishing the job and building the wall [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=99.68s)]
*  and staying in Mexico, and I think that'll work. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=104.36s)]
*  He also brought up two policies recently. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=107.4s)]
*  I was watching his speech in Wisconsin, and he talked about this when he was in Nevada. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=109.48s)]
*  One is, let's not tax tips of hardworking men and women in this country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=115.42s)]
*  I spent 10 years in the restaurant business. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=120.3s)]
*  I totally support that idea. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=122.42s)]
*  I think it's fair, because those people earn those tips, and the government—do you really [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  have to take, you know, every penny from every worker? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Number one, then he talked about an iron dome, the likes of which no country has ever seen [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=131.74s)]
*  before, understanding the nature of the threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=136.9s)]
*  Why don't you ever hear a creative idea like that ever from any Democrat? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=144.26s)]
*  Well, the reality is you have a leader of the Democratic Party right now that forget [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=149.78s)]
*  creative ideas is unable to articulate even the uncreative ones. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  But put that to one side, Sean. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=157.7s)]
*  The reality is our own homeland is more vulnerable than we have ever been, in part because of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=159.26s)]
*  that crisis at the southern border. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=163.82s)]
*  Do the math on the 20-plus million illegals in this country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=165.7s)]
*  Even if only 1% of them came here with awful intentions, that's still now several hundred [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  thousand people in the United States of America that could be capable of committing really [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=174.28s)]
*  heinous acts on this country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Compare that to the vulnerability of our electric grid to not only super EMP attacks, but also [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=180.52s)]
*  a country that's more vulnerable to hypersonic missile attacks than we've ever been at any [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=185.96s)]
*  time in either of our lifetimes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  So it is the responsibility of the United States of America to protect our own citizens. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=192.28s)]
*  And you see people like Joy Reid or the congressman she had on. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=196.4s)]
*  The reality is they care less about the citizens of this country today than they do about the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=199.52s)]
*  illegal migrants who are invading it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And the threats to this country, unfortunately, hopefully do not come to a head before we [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=206.0s)]
*  wake ourselves up and get our heads out of the sand. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=209.96s)]
*  And that's what I do think is one of the most important nonpartisan issues for this November, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=213.08s)]
*  is to keep this country safe and to rid ourselves of the crime and infestation that's a consequence [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=216.88s)]
*  of that border crisis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=222.36s)]
*  When you debated in the primaries, I thought you showed yourself to be very able in terms [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=225.28s)]
*  of being able to debate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  You're very sharp. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  You're very quick. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  You're very knowledgeable. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=233.64s)]
*  And Donald Trump is going into what I believe and you can disagree with me if you want a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=235.16s)]
*  three on one situation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  The rules are certainly in Biden's favor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=241.0s)]
*  They're going to mute his mic. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=243.16s)]
*  They'll probably interrupt him every time he speaks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  What advice would you give the president? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=248.66s)]
*  And do you think that out of my mind when I say that we should probably expect the return [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=251.0s)]
*  of Jack Dub Joe, the guy that we saw at the State of the Union? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=257.44s)]
*  I don't think that's crazy to think at all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  I do think a drug test is fair game. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=264.56s)]
*  The American people deserve transparency. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=266.24s)]
*  There was cocaine found in the White House earlier this year after all. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=268.48s)]
*  And I'm only saying that half jokingly, Sean. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=271.12s)]
*  The reality is, is this going to be a fair fight? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  Of course it's not. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  The reality is, is this going to be three on one? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=276.38s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=278.16s)]
*  I think the American people can see through that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=279.16s)]
*  So up there, is it going to be a little bit uncomfortable when you have the two moderators [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=281.24s)]
*  as though they're just debating with you from CNN after all, along with Joe Biden on the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=284.8s)]
*  stage? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=289.0s)]
*  Yes, it will. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=290.0s)]
*  My advice to President Trump, and I'm fully confident that he's prepared to execute on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=291.0s)]
*  it, is to just be himself. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=294.32s)]
*  Be honest with the American people who now see through those mainstream media tricks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=296.12s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=300.84s)]
*  Fool me twice, shame on me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=303.04s)]
*  Americans understand that, and they're not about to be fooled again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=304.84s)]
*  And so the reality is if he's calm, collected, stays true to his message of why he's in this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=308.68s)]
*  for the second term, why he's making the sacrifices that he is to come back and even make that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=313.12s)]
*  second term more successful than that successful first term, then I think things are going [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=317.88s)]
*  to go just fine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  What I worry about, Sean, is that Joe Biden might go the other direction and tank completely, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  which means that the Democrats might get what many in their party are rooting for, which [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=327.96s)]
*  is a replacement of Biden altogether. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  But either way, I think Donald Trump is going to show the American people who he is and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  that he cares about uniting this country in a way that many people haven't seen in him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=337.55999999999995s)]
*  He is somebody who cares deeply about national unity, and I hope and expect that will come [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=342.88s)]
*  across next week in the debate. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=347.2s)]
*  He did say something in his last interview with me, and that is success will unite us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=349.84s)]
*  America's economy coming back, border being secure, America reestablishing itself as the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=355.52s)]
*  leader of the free world, I think would all be very, very powerful in terms of moving [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=362.28s)]
*  in that direction. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnJT91Sz18&t=366.24s)]
