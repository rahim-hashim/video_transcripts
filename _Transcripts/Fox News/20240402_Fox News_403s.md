# Vivek Ramaswamy: This is what George Orwell warned about
**Fox News:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI)
*  Anyway, here with reaction to all of this, former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=0.0s)]
*  I was thought—look, he lied about having conversations with his son and brother and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  others about foreign business deals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=9.76s)]
*  For three years, he said the border was closed and the border is secure. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=11.64s)]
*  Now he's saying that the economy is doing great. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=15.64s)]
*  And now they're blaming Donald Trump for crime. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=18.0s)]
*  Is there any—does the buck stop there at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ever? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=19.92s)]
*  Well, look, the Affordable Care Act has made health care unaffordable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=26.64s)]
*  The list continues to go on, Sean. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  But I think the most insulting thing President Biden did was on Easter to name that transgender [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=32.92s)]
*  day of disability. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=37.6s)]
*  That is a slap in the face to every American, regardless of their faith. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=39.2s)]
*  And it's a good example of what's going on in the country, Sean. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=43.8s)]
*  It's not a tyranny of the majority that rules in the country today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=46.96s)]
*  It is a tyranny of the minority, of a fringe minority that's actually in the name of minority [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=50.44s)]
*  rights exercising a new form of cultural and political tyranny on the rest of the country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=55.24s)]
*  That's what the Biden presidency represents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  That's what the modern left has accomplished, using Biden as their puppet, their vehicle [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=62.6s)]
*  to accomplish it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  And we've got to see what's actually going on before we solve that problem. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think hundreds of millions of Americans today are beginning to see through that veneer [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=70.76s)]
*  for what it is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=74.62s)]
*  That's how we're going to win this November. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=75.92s)]
*  By the way, this is just breaking. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=78.04s)]
*  According to The Wall Street Journal, Donald Trump secured a $175 million bond to guarantee [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=79.44s)]
*  the civil fraud judgment during his appeal, saving him from having his assets and real [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=85.3s)]
*  estate seized. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=90.58s)]
*  Any reaction to what I believe is a weaponized Department of Justice under Joe Biden? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=91.58s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, that's obviously narrowly good news, but that is a breaking report you're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  bringing right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=102.74s)]
*  But it's an example of this weaponized system of justice. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=103.74s)]
*  Imagine the same shoe fit the other foot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=106.42s)]
*  What would the media's treatment be? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=108.14s)]
*  We're not a country where a political party in power and a president weaponizes the justice [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=110.02s)]
*  system to go after his political opponents in the middle of an election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=114.96s)]
*  At least that's not what the United States of America is supposed to be. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=118.64s)]
*  That is the stuff of banana republics. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=121.8s)]
*  And I am worried, Sean, we are skating on thin ice as a country right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=124.1s)]
*  Donald Trump is the one they're going after today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=128.12s)]
*  Well, it can be any American tomorrow. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=130.04s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  We have, for 250 years in, protected the dream of our founding fathers, setting this country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  into motion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=137.76s)]
*  That's what's at stake right now in this election is this is a 1776 moment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=138.76s)]
*  This isn't one of those elections where it's about increasing or decreasing the tax rate [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=142.96s)]
*  by 1% or 2% here or there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  This is about the basic rules of the road. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  Do we or don't we believe in free speech? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Do we or don't we believe in free and fair elections without interference from a justice [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  system prosecuting opponents in the middle of an election? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what's at stake this year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think that just as our founding fathers did 250 years ago, this is a moment for us [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=162.5s)]
*  to remember the basic ideals that this country was founded on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think if we do, we can win this election in a decisive landslide that, dare I say it, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=171.06s)]
*  unites this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  And that's what I'm rooting for Donald Trump to do and Republicans all the way down the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=177.5s)]
*  ballot to do as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=180.66000000000003s)]
*  That's what it's going to take to get this country back. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  You know, I said on this program in 2007, Vivek, I said that journalism in America is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  dead. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=189.38s)]
*  I had no idea how right I really would be. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=190.38s)]
*  We watched the incident last week with Ronald McDaniel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=192.74s)]
*  They don't even want a, you know, have you ever been a Republican or a Trump supporter? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=195.5s)]
*  That seems to be their new litmus test. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=201.66s)]
*  Biden lies about the transgender day of visibility. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=204.62s)]
*  He lies about the economy, told that lie, oh, the economy is great to Al Roker. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=208.66s)]
*  He lies about crime being Donald Trump's fault. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=213.7s)]
*  He lied about the border saying it's closed and secure, lied about never talking to his [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=216.7s)]
*  son, brother or anybody about their foreign business deals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=221.98s)]
*  There's an awful lot of lying and that lying never seems to get called out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=225.14s)]
*  And that to me is the greatest contribution. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=229.38s)]
*  He will have this campaign cycle that he had the last campaign cycle. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=232.1s)]
*  They let this guy hide in his basement and he was able to pull it off because of COVID. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  Now is anybody in the mainstream media, will they ever hold them accountable or is it always [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=241.74s)]
*  about Donald Trump, democracy in peril, demagoguing and lying about abortion, Republicans of race [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=247.24s)]
*  is sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, every phobic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=254.7s)]
*  I mean, dirty, they want dirty air and water. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=258.14s)]
*  When, when does the truth ever come out of their lips? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's possible anymore. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=264.06s)]
*  Of course they've abandoned all basis for trust of the American people, but this is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=268.62s)]
*  what George Orwell warned of when he wrote his books. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=272.46s)]
*  George Orwell intended it as a warning. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=275.42s)]
*  These people have taken it as a how to guide. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=277.9s)]
*  Just as George Orwell said, war is peace. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=280.46s)]
*  Now diversity is conformity. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=282.5s)]
*  Now inclusion and the name of inclusion, they've created a new culture of exclusion where certain [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=284.62s)]
*  points of view just aren't welcome. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=288.86s)]
*  But it's time for us as conservatives, Sean, to also level up, to rise up and say, we're [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  not just going to say this is who we're against, the Biden administration or the radical left. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  We have to see the problem for what it is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  But we also have to say this is what we stand for. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  This is what an alternative looks like. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=305.1s)]
*  And so if the left is preaching their message of race and gender and sexuality and climate, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=307.18s)]
*  I think it's time for the conservative movement to say we stand for the individual, family, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  nation, God. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  That beats race, gender, sexuality and climate if we have the courage to actually stand for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=319.16s)]
*  something. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  So that'd be my advice to Republicans this year is yes, we are up against a machine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes, we're up against a dishonest opposition, but we can't fall into the trap of just playing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=328.16s)]
*  whack-a-mole, just criticizing the other side or dare I say it, we'll have the same results [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=332.8s)]
*  we've had in 2022 and before. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=337.22s)]
*  If we want to win decisively, and I see Donald Trump taking steps in this direction and I'm [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=339.4s)]
*  going to do everything in my power to make sure that we go in this direction too, we [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=343.12s)]
*  have to articulate what we stand for as conservatives, as Americans stand for our sovereignty, stand [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  for an alternative vision. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=353.08s)]
*  And if we give the American people that, young or old, black or white, they're going to flock [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=354.64s)]
*  beyond behind our alternative vision. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=359.0s)]
*  That's what we conservatives need to step up and do this year. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=362.0s)]
*  And we have our work cut out for us. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=364.4s)]
*  How's the economy under Joe doing? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=366.76s)]
*  It's not very well. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=368.48s)]
*  How do you feel about the border? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=369.48s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=371.08s)]
*  How do you feel about energy prices in this country under Joe Biden? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=372.08s)]
*  Law and order and safety and security. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=377.08s)]
*  How's it working out in your town, in your city? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=379.32s)]
*  All top of mind. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=382.36s)]
*  How does America look on the world stage getting lectures now from Mexico and elsewhere? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=383.5s)]
*  We'll get into that later tonight. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=387.64s)]
*  All right, Vivek, thank you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=388.84s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrzptKiHbI&t=390.32s)]
