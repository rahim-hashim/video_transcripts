# Josh Hawley: Senate Dems voted to 'shred' the Constitution
**Fox News:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4)
*  And breaking tonight before even allowing it to proceed to trial, every Senate Democrat, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=0.0s)]
*  they voted to dismiss the impeachment of the Department of Homeland Security Secretary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=7.84s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas, whose dereliction of duty at the border has created what is a major [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=12.48s)]
*  national security crisis that is a clear and present danger to our country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=18.8s)]
*  Let us be very clear. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=22.72s)]
*  Every Senate Democrat today has aided and abetted in the lawbreaking at our border, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=24.64s)]
*  and all of them are guilty, as Joe Biden and Mayorkas, for any and all crimes and attacks [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=30.52s)]
*  that happen to this country and people in this country as a result of their lawless [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=37.72s)]
*  policies and them facilitating it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=43.3s)]
*  That's why the election in 201 days is so critically important. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, earlier today, amid growing concerns over their mounting safety issues, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=50.44s)]
*  a Boeing whistleblower who works as a quality engineer for the company testified before [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  the Senate about safety concerns and the threats he has received. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=61.36s)]
*  Now, during an exchange with Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, I'll take a look at what happened. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=65.28s)]
*  Are these planes safe? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Right now I would not—you know, it's like an earthquake. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=73.28s)]
*  The big earthquake is coming, but when that hits, the building that, you know, let's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=77.0s)]
*  say if you're talking of a building, have to be prepared to accommodate that type of, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=83.0s)]
*  let's say, shakeup. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=88.8s)]
*  You know, it has to be built properly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=89.8s)]
*  Right now, from what I've seen, the airplanes are not being built per spec and per requirement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=92.16s)]
*  The company's response to you was to threaten you? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=98.38s)]
*  To threaten you? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=103.76s)]
*  Sideline you? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=104.76s)]
*  You know, transfer you? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=105.76s)]
*  You raised concerns about the 787, and so they transferred you to the 777, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=108.04s)]
*  Well, in—yes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=113.08s)]
*  Now, Boeing has released a statement refuting his claims about flaws in their 787 planes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=114.08s)]
*  and a statement provided to our show tonight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=119.92s)]
*  The company said, in part, they continue to prioritize safety and quality while adding [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=122.36s)]
*  that any retaliation against employees is strictly prohibited. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=127.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, during a Senate energy and natural resources hearing yesterday, well, Hawley [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=132.08s)]
*  and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm had a very tense exchange. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=136.62s)]
*  This over her past stock trades, which she said she didn't do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=145.74s)]
*  They do not own stocks in areas that they have any influence over, nor do I. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=146.74s)]
*  Madam Secretary, all I have to say is this record is just deplorable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=151.02s)]
*  It is despicable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=154.56s)]
*  It is outrageous that hundreds of officers in the Energy Department are trading shares. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=155.9s)]
*  It is outrageous that you misled us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=160.5s)]
*  It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=162.46s)]
*  And it is outrageous you're going to conferences and events funded by foreign billionaires [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=166.22s)]
*  using dark money to try to influence our politics. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  This has got to change. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=173.06s)]
*  And frankly, you should go. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=176.22s)]
*  Senator Hawley joins us now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=177.74s)]
*  Let's stay with that exchange with the Energy Secretary. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  You believe she violated the Stock Act and for continuing to own shares in individual [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=184.38s)]
*  companies last year despite testifying, she did not own any individual stock. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=190.18s)]
*  Did she lie to Congress? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=195.84s)]
*  And isn't it a crime if in fact you do lie to Congress, Senator? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=196.84s)]
*  She did lie to Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=202.14s)]
*  What she said, Sean, is that she'd sold all of her shares, that she didn't own any stock [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=203.32s)]
*  in companies that she regulates. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=207.36s)]
*  Not true. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=209.02s)]
*  She later then came back, months later, and came back and said, oops, oops, I made a mistake. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  In fact, I owned a bunch of stock in a bunch of companies, including Ford, who the Energy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  Department obviously regulates and oversees. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  And she now expects us to buy that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=221.62s)]
*  Listen, it is a fact, Sean, an independent watchdog has found that she violated the law [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=223.06s)]
*  nine separate times. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  And yet here she is, still running the Energy Department, still trading stocks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=229.9s)]
*  I don't believe a word that she says. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=234.22s)]
*  She ought to resign. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=236.18s)]
*  It is a disgrace that she is sitting there making money on the stock market off companies [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=237.34s)]
*  that she regulates, when she's supposed to be making energy safe and cheap for the American [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=241.94s)]
*  people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=246.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=247.38s)]
*  So we've had all of these illegal immigrants, 10 million plus, unvetted, Joe Biden, illegal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=248.38s)]
*  immigrants, many coming tens of thousands from China, Russia, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=255.02s)]
*  And we've had murder. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=262.94s)]
*  We have had rape. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=264.14s)]
*  We have had other criminal activity, human trafficking, drug trafficking. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=265.34s)]
*  So—and I would argue that there are probably terror cells in our country right now, Senator, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=269.34s)]
*  because of the lack of the vetting that's supposed to take place, and they're supposed [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=275.98s)]
*  to come in the country illegally. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=280.62s)]
*  Now, some people say, well, this was a loss. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=282.34s)]
*  The House impeached Mayorkas. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=285.5s)]
*  The Senate wasn't able to follow through with the trial. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=287.7s)]
*  I would argue this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=290.06s)]
*  Every Democrat now is guilty of whatever crimes are committed by any of Joe Biden's illegal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=291.62s)]
*  immigrants because they have now aided and abetted in the process. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=301.94s)]
*  Well, what they're all guilty of is the crime of the open border, Sean, and they know it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=302.94s)]
*  That's why all 51 of them voted to protect Mayorkas today. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=309.18s)]
*  That's why all 51 of them voted to ignore, to shred the Constitution of the United States. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  It's because of the crime of the open border. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=317.42s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=318.94s)]
*  We've got violence on our streets, like we've hardly ever seen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=319.98s)]
*  We've got drugs pouring into our communities, the leading cause of death in this country, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=323.06s)]
*  fentanyl. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  Where's it coming? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  Across the southern border. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  Who's to blame? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden is, and Alejandro Mayorkas, they have done this deliberately, Sean, deliberately, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  for political gain. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=336.62s)]
*  And I just don't think the American people are going to let him get by with it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=338.18s)]
*  You know, I know somebody that actually works for Boeing and works in quality control. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=341.98s)]
*  I know a little something about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=348.62s)]
*  Now, Boeing has had the issue with the 737s. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=350.18s)]
*  The hearing today was more about the 787s. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=353.46s)]
*  But we've had all these incidents. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=355.82s)]
*  And I know a lot of people are afraid, you know, after reading example after example. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=357.62s)]
*  What I got back from people that I know that are involved in quality control is that, yeah, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=363.38s)]
*  Airbus has well surpassed Boeing in terms of quality. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=369.86s)]
*  That bothers me because I always want American companies to do well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=374.18s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  I hope it's not true. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  But Sean, I have to tell you, I'm worried. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  What I heard today from these Boeing whistleblowers, and let's just be clear, the clips you played, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=384.6s)]
*  those are Boeing employees. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=388.58s)]
*  Those aren't outside folks. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=389.94s)]
*  Those are people within the company, lifelong employees, engineers who have come forward [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=391.5s)]
*  and said, we are so concerned that the safety concerns are being ignored, the safety issues [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=396.26s)]
*  are being ignored. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=400.9s)]
*  My big issue with Boeing is I don't think they're being honest with us. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=402.62s)]
*  I don't think that they're checking their airplanes like they should. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't like the fact that more and more of their labor and parts is made overseas. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=406.9s)]
*  They're using overseas labor. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=411.26s)]
*  They're not making the stuff in the United States anymore. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAm2acxLY4&t=412.7s)]
