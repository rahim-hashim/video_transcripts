# Sen. Josh Hawley: The continuing resolution is a 'total joke'
**Fox News:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco)
*  Senator Josh Hawley, Senator, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I'm looking at this monstrosity. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=3.68s)]
*  I went through allâ€”a lot of these provisions, you know, 1,550 pages. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  Nobody had time to read it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=11.64s)]
*  It's all because they don't want to do their job and pass budgets by October 1st, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  which is the deadline. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=18.64s)]
*  And it's no surprise we find ourselves in this position. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And if I'm Donald Trump, I don't want that debt ceiling during my term. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=22.92s)]
*  This is Joe Biden's debt ceiling race. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=27.54s)]
*  It shouldn't be Donald Trump's. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=30.04s)]
*  If Hakeem Jeffries doesn't want to come to a consensus, then shut it down. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=36.24s)]
*  I think it's a misnomer that a government shutdown is the worst thing in the world. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=37.24s)]
*  We survived a 30-plus-day shutdown in 2019. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=40.0s)]
*  You know, Sean, this continuing resolution, whatever, it's a total joke. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=43.16s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=49.4s)]
*  It is 1,500 pages of pork barrel spending. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=50.4s)]
*  And worse than that, it's all the woke garbage. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=53.16s)]
*  It's the censorship boards. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  They're getting funded in this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=57.2s)]
*  There's hundreds of millions of dollars for a recycling access center in this bill. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=58.56s)]
*  I mean, it is a total offense. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=63.96s)]
*  And you pointed out there's also the pay raise for members of Congress. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=66.12s)]
*  Is the Obamacare carve out for members of Congress? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=69.0s)]
*  Here's the thing that really gets me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  Republicans negotiated this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=73.88s)]
*  The Speaker of the House negotiated this bill. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=75.2s)]
*  It is a total travesty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=78.64s)]
*  This has got to change, Sean. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we cannot go on like this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  And I hope that Republican leadership gets the message here, the message of this election, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  which is that people want change. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=88.4s)]
*  They don't want this garbage. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=89.76s)]
*  I'm a hard no on this thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=90.76s)]
*  It is a joke. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=92.72s)]
*  It is a travesty. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=93.72s)]
*  And they need to go back to square one. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=95.16s)]
*  Well, it's the old swampy way of doing things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=96.84s)]
*  There's going to be a new sheriff in town. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=99.48s)]
*  And when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy want to cut $2 trillion in spending, I think they're [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=101.84s)]
*  serious about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=107.4s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump is serious about that as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=108.48s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of cuts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=110.92s)]
*  And the old way of doing things has to go away. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=112.88s)]
*  If you want to return and be transformational to constitutional order, limited government, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=115.68s)]
*  greater freedom, do we achieve that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=120.92s)]
*  Or is this evidence that that's not going to be achievable, especially with the tight [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=122.84s)]
*  margins we have both in the House and Senate? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=127.12s)]
*  Well, you can't do it by doing business this way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the same old, same old. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=133.4s)]
*  You talk about needing to cut all of that spending. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  Sean, this bill right here would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=138.08s)]
*  And the worst part is, it's all for dim priorities. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=141.28s)]
*  Why would you saddle Donald Trump with this terrible spending bill before he even gets [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=144.34s)]
*  into office? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  And Sean, the worst part is, it dumps it right back at his lap in March. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  In March, under this bill, they'd shut the government down again, have to do this all [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=153.26s)]
*  over again, have to raise the debt ceiling again later the same year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=158.02s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=162.62s)]
*  It's a horrible plan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=163.62s)]
*  I can't believe that Republican leadership ever cooked it up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=164.94s)]
*  Clearly, they didn't talk to Trump about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=167.94s)]
*  And I tell you what, we need to have a serious look at who's leading this Congress, because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=170.0s)]
*  if this is the best they can do, I mean, it's just, it's total incompetence. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=174.46s)]
*  This is a disaster. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  The best worst-case scenario, considering they didn't do their job, would be a clean [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  CR. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=185.06s)]
*  Democrats say they won't support that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=186.06s)]
*  So we're at a standoff, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=188.22s)]
*  I don't see any way out of that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=193.9s)]
*  I mean, unless, listen, the government's going to shut down on Friday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=194.9s)]
*  And by the way, that was also the choice of Republican leadership. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=198.06s)]
*  They could very well have done this and extended it longer, which is what Donald Trump wanted. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=201.92s)]
*  They said, oh, no, no, no, we'll come back and do it in December. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Why did they want to do it in December, Sean? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=208.92s)]
*  So that they could force us up against the wall and try to get through all of their special [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  projects and their pet projects and spending. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=215.0s)]
*  And now they've been caught red-handed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=217.7s)]
*  And now they don't have a plan. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=219.32s)]
*  Well, that's their fault. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=220.32s)]
*  Mike Johnson and his crew need to figure this out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=221.44s)]
*  They need to do the right thing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=224.66s)]
*  And I tell you, this is not right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=225.66s)]
*  What they're trying to do is a disaster. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  If they own this, then they need to fix it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=229.88s)]
*  Well, it's already dead on arrival. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Senator Hawley, thank you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=234.28s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KT8FFHIqco&t=235.48s)]
