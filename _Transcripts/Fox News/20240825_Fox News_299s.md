# Kellyanne Conway, Dem strategist spar over Kamala's economic plan
**Fox News:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M)
*  All right, welcome back to Hannity. We're still live. We are in Chicago at the DNC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=0.0s)]
*  It is the final night. Kamala Harris had to take to the stage later tonight to accept [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=6.44s)]
*  the party's presidential nomination, where she has the chance to share her radical policies [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=10.8s)]
*  and beliefs with an audience of millions. Obviously, she's been doing a good job for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=15.96s)]
*  30 some odd days, hiding it. No interviews, no press conferences, no gaggles, just 15, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=21.2s)]
*  20 minute speeches, usually the same speech from a teleprompter. Anyway, here with reaction, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=27.6s)]
*  Fox Business, Fox News contributors, Marie Harp and Kellyanne Conway. It's only taken [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=33.04s)]
*  Marie seven years to come on my show. She would never come on. Why wouldn't you come [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=38.24s)]
*  on my show? I was waiting to be with Kellyanne tonight when Kamala Harris was accepting the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=42.28s)]
*  nomination. I was waiting for this historic night, Sean. All right. So are you going to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=46.92s)]
*  defend Kamala? Look at the tax policy tonight. Look at the largest tax increase, not only [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=51.32s)]
*  in American history, but the history of the world. Why would you support that? Why would [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=59.64s)]
*  you think that's good for the economy? If you're an American making less than $400,000, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=65.92s)]
*  your taxes will not go up. Check. Hold on. Fact check, which the media likes to do. If [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=71.12s)]
*  you have a 401k, if you have a retirement plan of any kind and you have unrealized capital [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  gains, they will tax those and they're not going to ask if you're making $400,000 a year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=83.58s)]
*  Now reality check, most Americans that work for a living that don't make anywhere near [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=89.14s)]
*  $400,000 a year, that means they're going to get taxed. So that line that they're using [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=93.42s)]
*  like Joe Biden used is not true. It is true, Sean. And more importantly, Kamala Harris's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=99.78s)]
*  plan is designed... Will you pay a tax on unrealized capital gains if you have a retirement [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=105.04s)]
*  plan? It will be taxed at the same rate as everything else. It's not a tax increase, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=110.4s)]
*  Sean. So if you make less than $400,000 a year, have a retirement plan and you have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  unrealized capital gains, you will pay taxes. What she is trying to do with this tax plan, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=120.0s)]
*  let's take a step up. You want an answer? I did. I already answered you. Let's take [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  a step up. She is trying to make sure that corporations and the wealthiest Americans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=126.72s)]
*  pay their fair shares. I got the talking point. And that's not a talking point, it's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=131.72s)]
*  the truth. Any American even that makes less than $400,000 a year that has a retirement [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=135.48s)]
*  account, they will pay taxes on unrealized gains. True or false? True or false? It's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=140.2s)]
*  true. Thank you. So they're lying when they say... They're not lying. Do you know what's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=145.6s)]
*  so interesting though? We are sitting here debating the intricacies of tax policy. Intricacies? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=149.56s)]
*  That's real money. Which are really important. When Kamala Harris has been out there for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=153.36s)]
*  30 days as this nominee of this party. Why won't she do an interview? Because she's talking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=157.12s)]
*  to real voters. She's out there every day. Maybe in seven years. She can beat me. But [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=161.12s)]
*  she's talking to real voters, real Americans, about what they... No, she's not. She's kicking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=166.56s)]
*  people out of diners and replacing them with actors. About what they care about. And tonight [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=170.56s)]
*  you're going to hear an aspirational message about what the future could look like and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  that we're not going back to the chaos and the anger and the division of Donald Trump's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=179.52s)]
*  presidency. Well, that is your hope. Kellyanne, help me out here. So I like this tax conversation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=184.52s)]
*  in this game of ping pong. And I'll tell you why. The Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will expire in 2025, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=190.08s)]
*  next year, unless it is extended. Kamala Harris is going to extend it. Democratic Congress is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=195.68s)]
*  going to extend it. What would that mean for the real Americans that Marie says Kamala's speaking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=200.32s)]
*  to? It means that the doubling of the personal exemption, the doubling of the child tax credit, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=204.48s)]
*  the fact that the corporate tax went down to 21%, Sean, and then they started investing in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=209.12s)]
*  inventory and employees and benefits and research and development. The fact that we did away with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=214.48s)]
*  these corporate inversions and 2.5 trillion overseas came back to us. I think people need [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  to understand. They need to see the world in which if things change, that the money that they are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=226.72s)]
*  already relying upon simply won't be there. I appreciate Marie giving it the old college [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  try here, but the fact is Kamala Harris is afraid to do what Marie Hark just did and afraid to do [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=238.48s)]
*  it on your show because you'll start asking basic questions about real portfolios. I just want to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=244.08s)]
*  play her in her own words about defund, no bail. I want to ask about all of the unvetted illegals, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=248.24s)]
*  the 11 million that are raping and killing and committing other violent crimes coming from top [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  geopolitical foes. I want to ask her about the people with terror ties they've allowed into our [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  country. I have a lot of questions. Yeah, a lot of granularity. And no tracking or drilling. I want [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=263.92s)]
*  to ask about that too. I think it'd be Kamala through a combination of just showing her in her [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=268.32s)]
*  own words, own video of her. It wasn't like she was at Woodstock burning a bra or burning [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=272.88s)]
*  an American flag when she was 19. This was last year and five years ago. That and a combination [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=277.12s)]
*  of what Brian Kemp said. Great interview about ground game. I agree. Governor Kemp is dead on. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvEE1vRUS2M&t=281.44s)]
