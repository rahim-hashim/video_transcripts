# Ted Cruz: 'Unburdened' is Kamala Harris' catch phrase for lying to Americans
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM)
*  Here's Big Tech putting their cement blocks on the scales of an election. Listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexa, why should I vote for Donald Trump? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=5.84s)]
*  I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=10.96s)]
*  Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=17.6s)]
*  While there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=24.32s)]
*  a woman of color who has overcome numerous obstacles to become a leader in her field. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=29.04s)]
*  Additionally, her experience as a prosecutor and her record of accomplishment in the areas [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=33.76s)]
*  of criminal justice and immigration reform make her a compelling candidate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=38.4s)]
*  Joining us now, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, look at this. You have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=44.08s)]
*  the deep state. We saw it happen in 2020. Fifty-one former intel officials, the FBI [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=48.08s)]
*  pre-bunking the very real laptop that they knew would be leaked. You've got Big Tech. We know [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=54.88s)]
*  their embalmment. Mark Zuckerberg revealed a lot of it. You have a corrupt media mob that is nothing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=60.32s)]
*  but an extension of their press office. You've got a Democratic party that will lie and say anything [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=65.76s)]
*  about any conservative, any Republican to win an election. And this is what Donald Trump and every [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=71.76s)]
*  Republican candidate, including you, are up against this cycle. How do you combat that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=77.6s)]
*  Well, listen, Sean, I think you just went through a very compelling indictment of the disaster, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  the train wreck that is Kamala Harris's record. The one thing is I thought you were a little bit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  unfair when you criticized her phrase, her catchphrase, unburdened by what has been. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that phrase is the central motto of her entire campaign. It ought to be the bumper [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=100.0s)]
*  sticker, Kamala Harris unburdened by what has been because Kamala's presidential campaign [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=106.32s)]
*  is unburdened by her record, is unburdened by truth. It is unburdened by reality. It is unburdened by [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=111.52s)]
*  the victims of her policies. Her campaign is unburdened by the 13 servicemen and women that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=118.08s)]
*  her failures killed in Afghanistan. It is unburdened by the millions of Americans hurting from inflation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=123.6s)]
*  It is unburdened by the families that can't afford to pay their bills anymore. It is unburdened by the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=129.92s)]
*  deaths that her open borders have caused. It is unburdened by the tragic murder of Lakin Reilly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=135.44s)]
*  It is unburdened by the tragic murder of Rachel Moran. It is unburdened by the tragic murder of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=140.8s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungery. It is unburdened from any acknowledgement that she is the sitting vice president [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=145.84s)]
*  and Joe Biden is at least ostensibly still the president when he's not comatose on a Delaware [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  beach. Unburdened is her catchphrase for lying to the American people because she cannot defend [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=158.08s)]
*  the catastrophic failures of her agenda. And that's the entire Democrat strategy is lie [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  and pretend that they don't support the policies that are hurting millions of Americans. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=170.8s)]
*  And unburdened from having to answer any questions of her own words, stated positions [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=177.12s)]
*  on every issue involving the economy, on illegal immigration, on law and order, on energy, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=184.88s)]
*  on foreign policy. She's unburdened. She doesn't have to answer questions. 16 minutes and 29 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=192.64s)]
*  seconds. That's it. And I would assume next week that Georgie Stephanopoulos is going to, you know, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=199.92s)]
*  hand his questions over to David Muir and he will dutifully read them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, and what Dana Bash did and CNN did, it's not even fair to call that an interview. It was not [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=213.92s)]
*  an interview. It was a campaign commercial. And it's a worthwhile question. This is something [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=219.12s)]
*  that I raised in my podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz. How would those interview questions have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=224.72s)]
*  been different if the quote interview was conducted by Corrine Jean-Pierre, the White House press [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=230.0s)]
*  secretary. Everything Dana Bash said is exactly what Kamala Harris's campaign wanted her to say. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  It was, madam vice president, tell us how you're going to help jobs. Madam vice president, tell us [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=241.36s)]
*  all the wonderful things you're going to do to secure the border. Madam vice president, tell us, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=247.36s)]
*  do you like kittens more or do you like puppies more? And madam vice president, let me close [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=251.52s)]
*  with showing an image of your grand niece gazing adoringly on you. You are an historic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=256.8s)]
*  transformation, transformational figure. Oh, let me clutch, clutch my heart. That's theoretically [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=262.72s)]
*  a journalist. CNN, the entire endeavor is, is literally a wholly owned subsidiary of the DNC. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=269.04s)]
*  And it was a complete laughing stock what they did. All right, Senator Ted Cruz, we appreciate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=277.2s)]
*  you being with us. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSr5SyMRkeM&t=282.71999999999997s)]
