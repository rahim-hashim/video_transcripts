# All three presidents FAILED this questioning: Rep. Elise Stefanik
**Fox News:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI)
*  And Congresswoman Stefanik joins us now with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=0.0s)]
*  You really do, you exposed something, it was a moment that you don't see often in Congress. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=3.2s)]
*  Three college presidents, three of the most prestigious universities, that gave the most [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=10.48s)]
*  appalling answer when you were asking a simple question about, you know, anti-Semitism. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=16.36s)]
*  I'm surprised it took the charge of plagiarism to make this happen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=23.32s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=27.12s)]
*  My take, Sean, is there is a reason that the testimony of the presidents of Harvard, Penn [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  and MIT made history as the most viewed testimony ever, with over one billion views. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=34.68s)]
*  And that's because their testimony was morally bankrupt and pathetic. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=40.0s)]
*  My question was very simple. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=44.0s)]
*  It was a moral question. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=45.8s)]
*  Does calling for the genocide of Jews ruin your school's code of conduct? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=47.6s)]
*  Does it go against your school's code of conduct? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  And every single one said it depended upon the context. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=55.0s)]
*  We know it does not depend on the context. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  It should be condemned. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=60.28s)]
*  It is not that difficult to say that, yet all three failed abysmally, and the world saw [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=61.28s)]
*  it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=66.48s)]
*  It is unacceptable that it took Harvard a month to demand the resignation of Claudine [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=67.48s)]
*  Gay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=71.92s)]
*  Penn made the right decision immediately, but this is after it was forced in front of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=72.92s)]
*  the world to see. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=76.48s)]
*  And I believe these university presidents sit atop these institutions that have rotted [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=78.14s)]
*  out and have institutionalized anti-Semitism, particularly after Hamas' terrorist attack [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=83.32s)]
*  against Israel in early October. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=88.24s)]
*  We've seen Jewish students assaulted, physically harassed and facing just vile, vile attacks [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=90.64s)]
*  every single day. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  If it didn't violate the code of conduct, and it depends on context, would they apply [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=100.6s)]
*  that standard? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=106.62s)]
*  Would they have answered the question the same way if it was clearly something said [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=107.62s)]
*  that was racist, misogynist, xenophobic, transphobic? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Would they have given you the same answer? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  I suspect the answer is no. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=121.52s)]
*  They wouldn't say, well, it depends on the context. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=123.96s)]
*  They would not have, they would not have, Sean, and that's why it was so pathetic. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  And it was so clear for everyone who saw that how wrong that testimony was. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=132.04s)]
*  And I will tell you, what you can't see in the video that has now been viewed over [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  1 billion times is there were Jewish students from each of those universities who were at [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=142.36s)]
*  that congressional hearing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  And as I was listening to their responses to my question, the university presidents, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  Jewish students, you could see them shaking just of the abysmal lack of moral leadership. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=152.56s)]
*  And then on top of this, you've seen just the shredding of academic integrity in Harvard's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  where it was very clear with this intense scrutiny that Claudine Gay was a plagiarist [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=163.52s)]
*  president, that she had plagiarized nearly 50 excerpts in her work, which is a very limited [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=168.56s)]
*  body of academic work when compared to other Harvard University presidents. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=173.96s)]
*  And I say this as a Harvard graduate, I graduated from there from undergrad with honors. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  And I will tell you, students, if you plagiarized, you're expelled. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=183.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=187.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, take a bow. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=189.04s)]
*  I think that was one of the best moments that I've ever witnessed in terms of a congressman [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=190.12s)]
*  or woman out there, you know, being able to literally stump college university presidents [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  on what was a layup question. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=203.56s)]
*  And they deserve to get fired, two down, one to go, in my opinion. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=209.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=210.32s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iRIOt3wJqI&t=220.04s)]
