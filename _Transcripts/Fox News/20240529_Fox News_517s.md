# Sean Hannity: There is no doubt Judge Merchan wants Trump convicted
**Fox News:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo)
*  Democrats, they are in a state of panic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=0.0s)]
*  They are desperate. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=2.4s)]
*  So, in lieu of any traditional campaign or running on the novel idea of answering the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=3.4s)]
*  question, are you better off than you were four years ago, well, the Democratic Party, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=10.26s)]
*  they are now relying on another political tactic. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  You can call it the weaponization of our Justice Department or simply just call it lawfare. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=19.6s)]
*  In New York City, Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Mershon's bogus case against Trump has all [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=24.68s)]
*  the elements of a left-wing lawfare campaign, including a politically driven DA, prosecutors [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=30.6s)]
*  who are active in the Democratic Party, a jury pool from one of the most anti-Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=37.64s)]
*  Republican conservative districts in the entire country, and of course, a partisan [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  hack judge who heavily and obviously and clearly favors the prosecution. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=47.44s)]
*  What we have seen from New York Judge Juan Mershon is a disgrace to our Constitution [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=53.4s)]
*  and our system of justice. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=60.28s)]
*  He hasn't just tipped the scales against Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=62.12s)]
*  Time and time again, he has acted as the prosecution's friend and ally. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=65.28s)]
*  And as I've been saying, basically, here's the scale of justice. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=70.6s)]
*  He's throwing cinder blocks on the scales of justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=74.32s)]
*  There's no doubt that Juan Mershon wants Trump convicted, and he's doing everything damn [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=77.36s)]
*  well possible to make that happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=83.0s)]
*  And tonight, more damning evidence of Mershon's judicial misconduct, to put it politely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=85.2s)]
*  His jury instructions were, well, not only unconstitutional, but rather insane. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=91.08s)]
*  Here's former U.S. Attorney Andy McCarthy explaining Mershon's latest gift to the prosecution. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=97.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  What's supposed to happen in a criminal trial is a prosecutor has to prove every element [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=103.68s)]
*  of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=109.16s)]
*  What this judge is telling this jury in this kind of make-it-up-as-you-go-along New York [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=112.0s)]
*  state prosecution of federal law is that when they get to the end of the rainbow and we [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=118.92s)]
*  get to the elements of the offense, the jury doesn't have to be in agreement on what it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=123.52s)]
*  is exactly that Trump did or what he was trying to commit or conceal when he allegedly falsified [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=128.28s)]
*  his business record. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=134.5s)]
*  So, they're going to give the jury a menu of choices and tell the jury that some of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=135.5s)]
*  them may believe that this was a criminal objective, some of them may believe something [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=141.36s)]
*  else was, but that they don't have to be unanimous on that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=145.8s)]
*  I actually think that's pretty outrageous. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=148.84s)]
*  A novel criminal charge and a novel approach to jury instruction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=152.24s)]
*  So according to Judge Juan Mershon, the jury, they don't need to reach unanimous decision [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=156.52s)]
*  on that phantom election allegation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=162.4s)]
*  The prosecution was never even able to really describe an unspecified federal election crime [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=165.56s)]
*  that was never charged or tried anywhere ever in America. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=172.04s)]
*  Apparently Judge Mershon believes he's above the law and was perfectly willing to trample [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  on our constitution at will. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=182.1s)]
*  Now we know from the 2020 Supreme Court ruling, Judge Mershon, you may want to pay close attention. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=184.6s)]
*  Somebody will tell you about this show. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=190.6s)]
*  It's called Ramos versus Louisiana. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=192.42s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=194.84s)]
*  You're ignoring it, but you've heard of it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Let me quote it for you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  There can be no question either that the Sixth Amendment's unanimity requirement applies [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=199.88s)]
*  to state and federal criminal trials equally. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=206.4s)]
*  And the law doesn't stop there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=210.96s)]
*  Here is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling from Andres V. United States. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=212.9s)]
*  It says, quote, unanimity in jury verdicts is required where the Sixth and Seventh Amendments [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=217.92s)]
*  apply. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=223.76s)]
*  That would be our constitution, Judge. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=224.76s)]
*  In criminal cases, this requirement of unanimity extends to all issues, character or degree [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=226.96s)]
*  of the crime, guilt and punishment which are left to the jury. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=233.68s)]
*  Again, quote, in criminal cases, this requirement of unanimity extends to all issues. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=238.32s)]
*  I'll repeat, all issues. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=245.84s)]
*  There's no carve out for Biden donating judges like Judge Mershon who hate Donald Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=248.52s)]
*  Here's another violation of Trump's civil liberties carried out by Judge Juan Mershon [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=254.8s)]
*  in the prosecution. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  According to Cornell Law, while the Sixth Amendment of our constitution, it grants all [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=261.0s)]
*  Americans, quote, the right to know who your accusers are, the nature of the charges and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=265.76s)]
*  evidence against you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=271.44s)]
*  So what is the election crime that Trump is being accused of? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=273.04s)]
*  Who's making the allegation? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  The prosecution? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=278.88s)]
*  They never answered these questions. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=280.28s)]
*  And now the judge is allowing the jury to choose, well, pretty much their own adventure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=282.28s)]
*  Pick whatever crime works for you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=288.0s)]
*  As long as there's 12 of you, it doesn't matter the reason. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to agree on that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=292.0s)]
*  Just agree that you hate the guy and want him to be guilty. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=293.0s)]
*  It doesn't even need to be unanimous. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=296.02s)]
*  This is totally unconstitutional, beyond unethical. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=298.34s)]
*  Judge Mershon is clearly trying to help the prosecution get this across the finish line, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=302.44s)]
*  despite no evidence of any crime. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=307.44s)]
*  Now, this, after constantly favoring the constitution, the prosecution, sustaining objections, allowing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=309.88s)]
*  irrelevant, immaterial, dishonest testimony, including misleading speculation that Cohen's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=317.88s)]
*  prior campaign finance violations are somehow tied to this trial. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=323.76s)]
*  Oh, and you really can't blame him for stealing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=328.48s)]
*  You know, he felt like he was treated badly and not really a big deal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=331.8s)]
*  And Trump's skilled, by the way. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=337.36s)]
*  And when it came to the defense, Judge Mershon lashed out at Trump's attorneys, berated [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=339.32s)]
*  Trump witness Bob Costello, blocked testimony from an expert witness on election law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=344.32s)]
*  Bradley Smith, former FEC chair, overruled most objections. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=350.64s)]
*  He placed a restrictive gag order, but only on Donald Trump. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=354.28s)]
*  And then he threatened to throw him in jail if he dared to violate it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=358.24s)]
*  This judge is out of control. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=361.44s)]
*  And now the cards have stacked against Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=363.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=365.92s)]
*  Mother Teresa could not beat these charges. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=366.92s)]
*  These charges are rigged. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=370.4s)]
*  The whole thing is rigged. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=371.4s)]
*  You have a trial like this where the judge is so conflicted he can't breathe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=372.4s)]
*  He's got to do his job. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=379.04s)]
*  And it's not for me that I can tell you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=380.04s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=383.04s)]
*  And I mean that Mother Teresa could not beat those charges. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=384.04s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=387.04s)]
*  We'll see how we do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=388.04s)]
*  It's a very disgraceful situation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  Now based on the four questions, the request from jury deliberations today, it appears [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=394.04s)]
*  the jury is closely studying the testimony and smear campaign presented by the prosecution. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=399.12s)]
*  Some believe that is a conviction that might be forthcoming. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  Make no mistake, a conviction won't be a surprise. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=410.16s)]
*  As a matter of fact, no outcome here will surprise me. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=413.88s)]
*  This is a jury selected from New York City and their voter rolls, where Biden won just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=417.0s)]
*  shy of 90 percent of the vote. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=422.84s)]
*  This is a jury tainted by a judge, Juan Mershon, who has been anything but fair. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=424.98s)]
*  Democrats have weaponized your system of justice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=431.72s)]
*  They have shred your constitution in the process. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=434.48s)]
*  And just imagine for a second, if a deep blue, deep red state like, let's say, Wyoming, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=437.76s)]
*  I don't know, Alabama, cooked up a felony charge against Barack Obama. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=444.64s)]
*  They used a novel legal theory, then tried the case before a judge who donated to Donald [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=449.8s)]
*  Trump and on top of that, dump cinder blocks on the scales of justice and pretty much let [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  the prosecution say anything they want, even accuse the defendant of a crime he's not [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=460.68s)]
*  accused of or constantly say he broke the law when in fact that should not have been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  immiscible. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  You think that would sit well with the Democratic Party and the mob and the media? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=476.0s)]
*  But tonight, some good news. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=477.48s)]
*  If Trump is convicted, this case will go to appeal and Trump will in the end win. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=479.1s)]
*  And if he is elected, he will have an important opportunity to restore America's system of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=484.6s)]
*  justice. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=489.64s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiiECtNGHjo&t=490.76s)]
