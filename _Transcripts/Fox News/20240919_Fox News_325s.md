# Speaker Mike Johnson: These questions need to be asked
**Fox News:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc)
*  Earlier tonight, the House voted on a continuing resolution to fund the government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker of the House Mike Johnson attached to the bill a SAVE Act, and that is aimed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=5.96s)]
*  at preventing illegal immigrants from voting in federal elections and, of course, had widespread [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=11.64s)]
*  opposition, especially from House Democrats. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=16.96s)]
*  The bill failed to pass in a 220-202 vote, giving Congress only 12 days to work together [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=19.72s)]
*  to avoid a government shutdown weeks before the election. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=26.72s)]
*  Joining us now, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=30.08s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, why would anybody be against proof of citizenship, voter ID, signature [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=32.92s)]
*  verification, chain of custody controls for mail-in ballots, updated voter rolls? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=38.44s)]
*  Why would they be against partisan observers in every precinct in the country watching [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=44.44s)]
*  the vote all day, the voting all day and the vote counting all night and into the next [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=48.76s)]
*  day if needed? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Why are they against those integrity measures? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=54.92s)]
*  These are great questions, Sean, and they need to be asked. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  The play that we ran tonight was the right play. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=60.84s)]
*  It was the right fight for the American people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=63.24s)]
*  It's the one they demand and deserve. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=65.16s)]
*  I've been saying for a couple of weeks now, Congress has two important responsibilities, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=67.08s)]
*  obviously, upon us right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  Fund the government and ensure the security of our elections. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=72.84s)]
*  I've been traveling the country nonstop, done campaign events in 206 cities across 39 states [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=75.68s)]
*  so far, without exception, Sean, in every venue, everywhere. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=81.16s)]
*  When we go to audience questions, the first or second question is about election security. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=84.66s)]
*  So the bill tonight would have accomplished both of those objectives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  We would have funded the government and secured the election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  And I'm very disappointed it didn't pass. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=96.2s)]
*  We ran the right play. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=97.84s)]
*  We came a little bit short of the goal line. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  So now we'll go back to the playbook. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=101.1s)]
*  We'll draw it up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=102.58s)]
*  We're already hearing good ideas from our members. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=103.58s)]
*  And we got time to fix this, and we'll get it done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=105.94s)]
*  Let me ask you, you keep saying it's the right play, and you can't get every Republican [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=108.98s)]
*  to vote for it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=115.5s)]
*  That's your own party. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=116.5s)]
*  What are their objections, and how do you get them on board? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  Look, there's a range of objections. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  Some people look for the perfect piece of legislation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Some people are philosophically opposed to continuing resolutions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=128.32s)]
*  Look, I'm one of those. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=131.38s)]
*  I don't like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=132.5s)]
*  But everybody needs to understand the reason that 12 separate appropriations bills were [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=133.7s)]
*  not ready for passage is because Chuck Schumer and the Senate have not done their job. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=138.06s)]
*  They have not put one appropriation bill on the floor for passage. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=143.06s)]
*  So we're far apart between the two chambers. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=147.18s)]
*  There's nothing that we can negotiate because they didn't put anything on the table. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=149.74s)]
*  And we have the end of the fiscal year, September 30th. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=153.52s)]
*  So we're pushed into this scenario, into this dilemma, because of the Senate's inability [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  or unwillingness to do their job. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=161.02s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is to blame for this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=163.18s)]
*  OK, and you did make the comment that you're not going to be rolled by the Senate, which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=165.42s)]
*  I like to hear. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=169.46s)]
*  And then it just brings up the question of, OK, well, even if you increase your majority, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=172.46s)]
*  what does this mean for you running for speaker inâ€”if Republicans hold the House and hopefully [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=177.46s)]
*  even add to their majority? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=184.22s)]
*  Does this hurt you in any way? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=186.26s)]
*  Now, look, this is part of the process. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=190.14s)]
*  I mean, we have a small margin, and that's why we're laser focused on growing that majority. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=192.18s)]
*  It's critically important. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=197.46s)]
*  I want everybody to remember this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=198.46s)]
*  When Donald Trump is elected president, if the Democrats have the majority in the House, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  they will impeach him on the first day of office. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  Everybody knows what will happen here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=207.8s)]
*  We have got to grow the majority, and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to, Sean. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=209.24s)]
*  I'm very bullish about the election cycle. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=212.42s)]
*  In fact, if you go to growthemajority.com, you'll see all of our reasons for hope. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=214.1s)]
*  We have an extraordinary stable of candidates that are going to flip these blue seats to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=218.18s)]
*  red, and our incumbents are going to be re-elected. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=222.1s)]
*  We're going to be in the driver's seat in January for the beginning of the new Congress. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=224.62s)]
*  And we're going to have Republican control of the Senate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=227.98s)]
*  We're going to grow the House majority, and Donald Trump will be back in the White House. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=230.22s)]
*  Why are Republicans so reluctant to ever shut down the government? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=234.18s)]
*  Why don't they just shut it down? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=238.5s)]
*  Because, let's be honest, when they do shut down the government, it's not really a shut [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=240.9s)]
*  Nonessential workers get a furlough. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=246.18s)]
*  They usually get back pay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  And essential workers keep working. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=250.74s)]
*  Our armed forces keep working. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=253.9s)]
*  Social security checks, et cetera, that keeps going out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=256.26s)]
*  Essential services continue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=261.58s)]
*  And then people in the end end up getting a paid vacation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=263.98s)]
*  Why are people so reluctant against that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=267.06s)]
*  Well, if you're a military family and a spouse is deployed and you're at home with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  children, you rely on that paycheck to come in. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=274.06s)]
*  You rely on getting paid on time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=276.78s)]
*  If you're a TSA agent or a Border Patrol agent, you know, we need them to be doing their job [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=278.46s)]
*  and not going on furlough and not having people not showing up for work because they're not [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  getting checks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=287.38s)]
*  But look, I don't think it's going to come to a shutdown. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=288.38s)]
*  I believe we can get this job done. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  Like I said, we go back to the playbook. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=292.46s)]
*  We have time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=293.94s)]
*  We have time to get it done. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=294.94s)]
*  And we will. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=295.94s)]
*  We're going to deliver for the American people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=296.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=297.94s)]
*  Well, we appreciate it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=298.94s)]
*  We'll watch it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  Twelve days, not a lot of time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Nobody ever hits their deadline when it comes to budgets in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=304.54s)]
*  We do appreciate your time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=310.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5hytYDTBc&t=312.94s)]
