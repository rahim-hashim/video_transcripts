# Democrats are ‘panicking’: Gov. Kristi Noem
**Fox News:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM)
*  Joining us now, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm dying to get your take on Mark Cuban. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  And smart, intelligent women are never around Donald Trump, when I just see the exact opposite [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=6.96s)]
*  around Donald Trump all of the time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=13.44s)]
*  His campaign was run in 2016 by Kellyanne Conway. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=15.84s)]
*  It's run this year by Suzy Wiles. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=19.04s)]
*  I think Ivanka and Tiffany Trump are brilliant. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=22.04s)]
*  Melania is obviously brilliant. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=25.0s)]
*  I think she speaks five or six languages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=26.72s)]
*  I'm not sure the exact count. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=28.84s)]
*  And, you know, everyone from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, you, Kayleigh McEnany have all worked [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=37.2s)]
*  But Mark Cuban, surrogate of Kamala, says what she says, Joe calls us garbage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=38.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was shocked when he said that, that women around President Trump are not strong [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  or intelligent. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Over 50 percent of the voters in this country are women, and we tend to stick together. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  So the fact that he said that was unbelievable to me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=55.4s)]
*  And Sean, what surprised me the most about him was how emotional Mark Cuban was, how [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=58.6s)]
*  it clearly he is panicking. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=64.08s)]
*  And so are the people who support Vice President Harris and want her back in the White House. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=66.44s)]
*  They're panicking because they see Donald Trump out relating with the American people, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=70.6s)]
*  spending time with them, having fun, talking about what a bright future we would have with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=74.6s)]
*  his leadership and that we could have four more years of prosperity like we enjoyed the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=79.4s)]
*  last time he was in the White House. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=83.92s)]
*  So, you know, it's I think about the Donald Trump that I've known, but even before I knew [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=85.52s)]
*  him back in the 80s and 90s, how he elevated women. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=91.52s)]
*  He put them in charge of his companies on the leadership and executive teams. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=94.66s)]
*  I have so many women who've come up to me over the years that said I worked with him [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=98.56s)]
*  back in New York City and he gave me my first supervisor position and gave me the first [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=102.36s)]
*  opportunity to provide for my family and go after my career when I'd been passed over [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=106.8s)]
*  so many times before. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=111.56s)]
*  That's the Donald Trump that I know and that I've heard about and heard so many testimonies [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=113.72s)]
*  about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  And Mark Cuban and Joe Biden and President Obama and Kamala Harris, they've all insulted [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  women throughout this campaign because every day they get up and they get on TV and they [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=125.28s)]
*  lie. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=129.04s)]
*  And if there's one thing a woman can discern, it's somebody who's lying to us and not being [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=130.04s)]
*  forthright. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=134.84s)]
*  And all we want is the truth so we can protect our children, feed them and go after the career [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=136.2s)]
*  of our dreams. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=140.2s)]
*  Is the border more safe and secure? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  The answer is obviously no. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  Has defund, dismantle, reimagine, no bail laws, does that work? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=146.7s)]
*  Obviously no. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=150.98s)]
*  Our towns, our cities are less safe, less secure. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=151.98s)]
*  Is the economy still—we still pay in 30-plus percent more for every item we buy and every [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  store we go to? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  Are we still paying about a buck-fifty more a gallon of gasoline? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=166.1s)]
*  On every issue, is the world a better, safer place? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=168.54s)]
*  No, we've got war in Europe, we've got war in the Middle East, and we have two people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=171.7s)]
*  that are leading this country that are—have no respect of these dangerous figures in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=176.82s)]
*  world like Putin, the mullahs in Iran, President Xi. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=183.42s)]
*  They have no respect for them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=187.4s)]
*  So the world is less safe and secure with them in place. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=189.1s)]
*  They can't run on, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=193.18s)]
*  So I guess this is what we're left now for the next, what, three days? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=196.74s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=202.62s)]
*  We're going to get out and talk to as many people as possible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=203.62s)]
*  I'm in North Carolina today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=205.26s)]
*  I spent the day with Samaritan's Purse handing out winter clothing to folks up in the mountains [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=206.7s)]
*  who don't have a lot of access or anything that they own and have lost their homes and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=212.26s)]
*  loved ones as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  Going to Michigan and to Georgia and Pennsylvania before this election is over on Tuesday. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=218.1s)]
*  But listen, what women want and what people in this country want is they want a leader [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=223.78s)]
*  that is strong enough to tell the truth and even on the national security stage like you [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=228.26s)]
*  talked about, that foreign leaders and world leaders respect us. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  Because when it matters, we're definitive, we're forthright, and we stand by our allies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has undermined our allies in our security position for about the four [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=242.42s)]
*  years that she's been in the White House. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=247.62s)]
*  And Sean, that border, she has let 13,000 murderers into this country, 16,000 rapists [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  and turned them loose in our cities and our small towns. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=258.08s)]
*  In fact, it's enough murderers that we would have four new murderers in every single county [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=261.2s)]
*  in this country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=266.76s)]
*  Now, I'm a mom and a grandma and I don't want any murderers in my county. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=267.76s)]
*  I don't want them anywhere near me, but everybody can relate to how small a county is. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=271.34s)]
*  And we've got four more murderers in every single county in this country because of Kamala Harris. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Try raising your kids in a city, in a state that is safer and feeling safer with that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  kind of a situation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=287.18s)]
*  This world and this country has gotten much more dangerous because of Kamala Harris. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=288.62s)]
*  She does not deserve to be the leader of the free world, much less be somebody that we [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=293.0s)]
*  can point to as having the dignity of being the president of the United States. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=297.38s)]
*  Governor Welles said, appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqGXqtOJKM&t=303.34000000000003s)]
