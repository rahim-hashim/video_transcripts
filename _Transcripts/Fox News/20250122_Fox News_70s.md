# President Trump: The radical left's philosophies and policies are horrible
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk)
*  Let's talk about the moment you walked back in this office, this desk, this room, your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=0.0s)]
*  carpet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  How'd you feel? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=8.6s)]
*  Well, it was a lot of work. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=9.6s)]
*  And as you know, I felt that we shouldn't have had to necessarily be here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=13.24s)]
*  It could have been done. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=17.76s)]
*  A lot of work could have been â€” it would have been over. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We wouldn't have inflation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=22.8s)]
*  We wouldn't have had the Afghanistan disaster. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=23.8s)]
*  We wouldn't have October 7th with Israel, where so many people were killed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=26.64s)]
*  And you wouldn't have a Ukraine war going on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  But with all that being said, I think it's bigger. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=33.32s)]
*  It's bigger than if it were more traditional. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Only the second time in history somebody didn't have consecutive terms. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=45.56s)]
*  Well, they say it's historically bigger. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=46.56s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=48.16s)]
*  But I can say it showed us a couple of things. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=50.44s)]
*  That the radical left, their philosophies and policies are horrible. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVCPqyJJtbk&t=52.96s)]
