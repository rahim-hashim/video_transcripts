# ‘DEVASTATING’: Mother reacts to arrest of suspect in daughter’s murder case
**Fox News:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE)
*  We now turn to a senseless act of violence out of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=0.0s)]
*  A young mother of five named Rachel Morin was murdered along a popular hiking trail [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  by an alleged perpetrator from El Salvador, who is also suspected of another murder in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=11.3s)]
*  his home country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=17.04s)]
*  I mean, our deepest sympathies, our prayers go out to Rachel's entire family. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=18.36s)]
*  Anyway, we're joined now by their mother. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=23.16s)]
*  Patty Morin is with us, and family attorney Randolph Rice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=25.46s)]
*  Patty, I know there are no words that I can offer you to comfort you and comfort your [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=30.22s)]
*  family. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=35.3s)]
*  How are you holding up? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=37.78s)]
*  How are the kids holding up? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=38.9s)]
*  I can't imagine very well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=40.34s)]
*  No, it's been a very difficult time, well, obviously a very difficult time for all of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=43.06s)]
*  And then feeling hopeless at some points along the way these last 10 months, not knowing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=51.9s)]
*  if we would find the suspect, and then having it announced that a suspect was found, it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=58.46s)]
*  just brought back all those emotions, you know, really deep emotions of pain and grief. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=66.98s)]
*  And so it's like processing her death all over again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=76.74s)]
*  It's been really hard. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=80.06s)]
*  You know, I know you speak as a loving mother, and I did see your comments earlier. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=82.34s)]
*  And you said something that is truthful, and I don't really believe it's political either. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=88.7s)]
*  And I believe that all of this is preventable if we just enforce the laws at our border. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=93.38s)]
*  And you pointed out, because of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services not doing their [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=100.68s)]
*  jobs and agencies not doing anything to prevent this, otherwise it could. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=105.46s)]
*  You know, these crimes can be prevented. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=113.02s)]
*  Does that make it harder? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=116.78s)]
*  Because that would make it harder for me, I think, and I speak as a parent myself. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=117.78s)]
*  Yes, it's a senseless death. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=122.3s)]
*  I mean, who would expect almost 2,000 miles from the southern border somebody coming from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=126.78s)]
*  another country coming into our small town and just randomly attacking someone and brutally [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=134.78s)]
*  murdering them? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  It's like we've opened our doors and you let a stranger into your house. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=146.74s)]
*  Who does that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  We're not protecting ourselves. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  We're not protecting our families. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=155.58s)]
*  And I think that if they had left things in place, and here I am going, I promise I wouldn't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=157.28s)]
*  be political, but if we had left things in place, my daughter might still be here today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=163.82s)]
*  I don't know if you really go on political or if you really go on common sense, because [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=171.26s)]
*  those policies were working. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  You did say earlier that Biden sure isn't trying to prevent these crimes from happening, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=176.94s)]
*  and he's the one welcoming illegal immigrants here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=181.86s)]
*  And look at the announcement today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=186.02s)]
*  I mean, he could have mentioned your daughter's name. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=187.86s)]
*  He could have mentioned this 13-year-old girl. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=190.86s)]
*  He could have corrected the name Laken Reilly when he wrongly said Lincoln Reilly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  He could be looking at what families like yours are now suffering through, and he's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=200.42s)]
*  not doing it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=207.42s)]
*  He talked about amnesty, and he told the American people that which he's been telling them [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=208.42s)]
*  for three years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=212.42s)]
*  The border's secure and the border's closed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=213.42s)]
*  Eleven million illegal immigrants later. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=215.54s)]
*  It is not true. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=217.62s)]
*  And you know it's not true, and you're suffering because it's not true. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=219.82s)]
*  Worse, I'm suffering as a mother, but her children and now her grandchild won't even [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=223.62s)]
*  know it's— [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=231.74s)]
*  They're suffering, too. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=232.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=233.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=234.74s)]
*  It's just devastating. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=235.74s)]
*  It's an unnecessary death. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=236.74s)]
*  Like innocent lives being taken every day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=240.62s)]
*  It's just—it's unnecessary. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=243.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=246.86s)]
*  You know, Randolph Rice, let me ask you a question. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=248.22s)]
*  And you're an attorney, and I hear you have a really great reputation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for being on the show, sir. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=255.86s)]
*  And you know, please know my heart breaks for this family. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=258.22s)]
*  And I talk to Laken Reilly's family, and I don't know if you ever recover from something [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=261.98s)]
*  like this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=266.82s)]
*  If I were to go down to the border and I were to pick up people at the border and I were [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=269.26s)]
*  to transport them to other states, why do I think that I'd be guilty of human trafficking? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=274.5s)]
*  How is it that our government is doing that very thing and they're taking in people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=281.17999999999995s)]
*  from countries with terror ties and our top geopolitical foes? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  How come that's not a legal issue that has been won in court? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, because the rules don't apply to the politicians, unfortunately. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know, this is again not a Republican or Democrat issue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=299.9s)]
*  This is an American issue that they need to stop. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=303.46s)]
*  They need to reset this border because Rachel Moran's death was preventable. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=305.82s)]
*  They could have stopped this by stopping this individual who just a month before this had [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  murdered a woman in El Salvador and comes across the border and attacks women in Los [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=316.62s)]
*  Angeles and comes 1,800 miles and kills Rachel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  So this can be prevented. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=325.02s)]
*  They need to stop everything there, reset, reevaluate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=326.82s)]
*  They can have policies in place. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=330.76s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=332.82s)]
*  But we need to be able to see who's coming across this border and stop people like this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=333.82s)]
*  suspect who killed Rachel. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=337.14s)]
*  How about we put politics aside and we just say that if you want to enter our country, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=339.9s)]
*  you enter legally. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  We do a background check to make sure you don't have radical ties. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=344.9s)]
*  We do a health check in a post-pandemic world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=348.78s)]
*  And we have to show that you're not going to be a financial burden on the American people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=352.17999999999995s)]
*  Then I don't really care where you come from. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=356.7s)]
*  Welcome to our country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=359.17999999999995s)]
*  You're part of our family. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=360.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Ma'am, I just can only say to you, our deepest sympathies, our love and our prayers to you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  and your family, the best to your grandchildren. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=368.26s)]
*  I know they're going to need you now more than ever. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=370.94s)]
*  And counselor, thank you for being with us as well. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=373.54s)]
*  Appreciate your time tonight. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=376.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpxaI1_eE&t=377.7s)]
