# Joe Concha: What is CBS News hiding?
**Fox News:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw)
*  Now, 60 Minutes, you know that show on CBS, they finally addressed the friendly editing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=0.0s)]
*  made to their interview with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=5.68s)]
*  Apparently, CBS decided to replace a Kamala word salad with a more succinct answer in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=8.24s)]
*  order to, quote, allow time for other subjects for his part. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=14.4s)]
*  Donald Trump pointed out that the show's statement is not exactly a denial, that they [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=18.16s)]
*  cleaned up the vice president's remarks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=22.6s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, 60 Minutes and that appearance was part of that media blitz by Harris to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=25.12s)]
*  get her message out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  It didn't go well with Bret Baer, did it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  And now her running mate, Tim Walz, is on his own tour, which included a chat with the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=33.56s)]
*  hard-hitting host of that hit show, The View. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=39.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  So you're out hunting pheasants. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  Is that enough to convince people there's a middle ground on this issue? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  Because right now, right wingers are coming after you for how you handle your shotgun. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=50.08s)]
*  Well, I can shoot better than all of them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=57.48s)]
*  I got the trophies to prove it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=60.8s)]
*  Look, that's what they do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=63.92s)]
*  We wanted to help you out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=65.52s)]
*  We know your flannel had been through some stuff. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  So we've got The View and a dad in cloud. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=70.96s)]
*  That's the single greatest thing I've ever gotten. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  So that's for you to freshen up that wardrobe a little. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=80.16s)]
*  And if you win, will you wear it back and come back and visit us? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  When you win, will you wear it back and come back and visit us? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=88.8s)]
*  Yes, I'm wearing it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=90.8s)]
*  But that's what I was going to say. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=91.8s)]
*  You know I'm wearing it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=92.8s)]
*  It's so sweet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=93.8s)]
*  Is he actually going to wear that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=96.8s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributors, Joe Concho, Charlie Heard with us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Joe, I just got to hand it to you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=104.12s)]
*  You're the media analyst. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=106.08s)]
*  Yeah, not exactly the best moment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=108.08s)]
*  I don't think these fluffy interviews are helping either one of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=110.76s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=114.2s)]
*  Tim Walz is like the least cultured person at a bus station. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=116.72s)]
*  I don't know how you go on a show like that and say, oh boy, this is going to move the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=120.56s)]
*  needle. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=124.84s)]
*  I'm a dad. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=125.84s)]
*  In a billion years, I'm not wearing a Dads for Plads shirt handed to me by a TV show [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=126.84s)]
*  like The View. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=131.8s)]
*  Look, Walz, the bottom line is that Kamala Harris had a one-inch putt. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=133.8s)]
*  She could have taken Josh Shapiro, popular governor, Pennsylvania, a state that she needs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=137.6s)]
*  Instead, she takes the goofy 80s sitcom dad who is Tim Walz. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=142.32s)]
*  And when we look back at this campaign of Trump wins, that's going to be the big, big, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=147.08s)]
*  big deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=150.8s)]
*  I'll hand it over to Charlie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=151.8s)]
*  Well, I got to say, I like the 80s sitcom dad because I don't even think he's that sophisticated. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=153.4s)]
*  Charlie, get your take. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, if the guy is struggling with men voters, I don't know why giving him a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=164.0s)]
*  pair of plaid pajamas is going to help him much with that particular voting group. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=170.08s)]
*  You know, the problem is, and then of course, you know, he's walking around, they show footage [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=176.96s)]
*  of him walking around a pheasant field with a shotgun and then they claim that Donald [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=179.96s)]
*  Trump staged his visit to McDonald's, all of which is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=186.0s)]
*  These people are total complete fakers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=193.36s)]
*  And the only reason that they are where they are right now is because they have a dutiful [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=196.08s)]
*  pliant media that is desperate to prop them up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=201.52s)]
*  And I think that that 60 minutes admission, and by the way, the Trump campaign is exactly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=205.52s)]
*  right about this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  This was not a denial that 60 minutes issued. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a complete admission that they altered her response in order to make her look less [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=214.34s)]
*  idiotic in answering Charlie's question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=222.76s)]
*  Well, they couldn't lie about it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=223.76s)]
*  Charlie, we've got the tape. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  They couldn't lie about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=228.64s)]
*  Yes, they could, but it wouldn't work. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=229.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  And so they come out and admit it, but then refuse to acknowledge that they're still propping [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  her up and they're desperate to prop her up and that without them, you know, this campaign [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  would be long over. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=243.72s)]
*  I tend to agree. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=246.32s)]
*  I will tell you, I just don't think what they're doing is working. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=248.2s)]
*  I did offer Joe Conch, I think I should say this publicly, a full hour to Kamala Harris [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=251.84s)]
*  on this program. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=257.2s)]
*  As of coming on the air today, we've not heard back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=258.94s)]
*  Do you think I will get a call back? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=261.96s)]
*  I think that'll happen when, you know, the Jets win the Super Bowl again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=266.0s)]
*  I don't see it happening now at this point, Sean. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=269.84s)]
*  But the question is, what is 60 minutes hiding? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=272.86s)]
*  Seriously, I know, he gets Aaron Rodgers, all these great players, and they still can't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  win. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=280.08s)]
*  That's the thing, though. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=281.08s)]
*  What are they hiding exactly? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=282.08s)]
*  You would give Kamala Harris 60 minutes and you would put on that interview the way Brett [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=283.84s)]
*  Baer did, unedited, not manipulated, because if they're not hiding anything, they would [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=287.0s)]
*  release the entire transcript, full video and audio of that interview. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=292.26s)]
*  Instead, we only saw 21 minutes of an edited video on 60 minutes that night, but the entire [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  interview, I don't know if you know this, went on for 45 minutes, meaning more than [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=300.96s)]
*  half of it is being kept from the public like it's the Holy Grail. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  And I'm willing to bet, Sean, that this controversy goes far beyond 60 minutes manipulating one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=308.98s)]
*  of Kamala Harris' answers to make her look better. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=313.66s)]
*  I'm willing to bet they left several parts of that interview on the edit room floor that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=315.74s)]
*  did not put her in a good light at all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=319.62s)]
*  I was asked to be on 60 minutes and I said, live to tape, Charlie, or no thanks, because [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  they edit, they slice, they dice, they build a narrative around it, and you could turn [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  anything into a pretzel. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=333.1s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=334.44s)]
*  It was a horrible answer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=335.44s)]
*  They turned it into a succinct answer. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=336.44s)]
*  So I think the editing is going to hurt them in the end. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=338.44s)]
*  In today's media environment, I wouldn't dream of going on any of these shows that wasn't [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=341.44s)]
*  live, quite frankly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=349.96s)]
*  I would even do live to tape. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=350.96s)]
*  I would do straight up live, no funny business, all out there exactly. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=352.48s)]
*  It's the only way you have any hope of controlling any sort of message with these people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=359.52s)]
*  The real problem, what is Kamala Harris hiding? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=363.64s)]
*  She cannot answer the central question of her campaign, which is, 79% of Americans think [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=367.22s)]
*  we're going in the wrong direction. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=374.72s)]
*  What are you going to do differently than your predecessor, than your current administration? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=376.6s)]
*  We know the answer. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=380.92s)]
*  And she can't answer that question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=381.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  All right, good to see you both. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4fikFCXxEw&t=384.40000000000003s)]
