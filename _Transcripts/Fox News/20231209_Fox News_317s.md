# Jason Chaffetz: There is no justification for this
**Fox News:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY)
*  All right, tonight, sadly, anti-Semitism, it is on the rise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats, they seem not quite as sure how to respond. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=3.7s)]
*  On Thursday, the very first day of Hanukkah, a man shouting, Free Palestine, literally [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=7.92s)]
*  fired a shotgun outside of a temple. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=13.9s)]
*  Now, this, as many on the left are voicing public support for a global Islamic war, or [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=16.56s)]
*  what they call Antifahter, and other left-wing demonstrators now openly condoning what? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=22.92s)]
*  The rape, the murder, the torture of October the 7th, praising Hamas for confronting their [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=28.5s)]
*  quote oppressors by any means necessary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=34.06s)]
*  Earlier in the week, we had the presidents of Harvard and MIT and UPenn. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=37.46s)]
*  They refused to condemn calls for genocide without more context. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=42.38s)]
*  And get this, the executive director of the group CARE, that's the Council on American-Islamic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=47.34s)]
*  Relations recently praising the October 7th massacre, proclaiming that Israel has no right [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=52.42s)]
*  to self-defense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege, the walls of the concentration camp, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=72.86s)]
*  And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=75.02s)]
*  their own land and walk free into their lands that they were not allowed to walk in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=82.78s)]
*  And yes, the people of Gaza have the right to self-defense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=92.86s)]
*  All right, and get this, it gets way worse. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=96.42s)]
*  They were coordinating with CARE in an official capacity to quote combat anti-Semitism. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=100.98s)]
*  Now, since those despicable and repulsive comments, the White House has been frantically [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=107.34s)]
*  trying to distance itself from CARE and scrubbing any mention of the group from the White House [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=113.18s)]
*  website. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=119.98s)]
*  And both the vice president and the second gentleman have also recently condemned anti-Semitism, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=120.98s)]
*  frankly, after weeks of silence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=126.78s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and bestselling author and former [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=129.66s)]
*  special envoy for combating anti-terrorism, Noah Tishby is with us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=134.3s)]
*  Noah, your reaction to this? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=138.9s)]
*  My reaction is that we're very pleased that CARE was removed from the White House website [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=143.1s)]
*  when anything that has to do with anti-Semitism. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=147.14s)]
*  The fact of the matter is this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=150.62s)]
*  CARE has had a history of, let's say, questionable remarks when it comes to the Jewish people, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=152.18s)]
*  and they should not have been a part of the anti-Semitism strategy of the White House. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=157.1s)]
*  One of their San Francisco chairs said a couple of years ago that we have to be careful of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=161.02s)]
*  the Zionist organizations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  What we're seeing here is the truth coming out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=168.78s)]
*  The fact of the matter is this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  All these organizations do not want Israel to exist. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=172.78s)]
*  They're trying to wipe Israel off the map, and they're trying to do this in a very convoluted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  and kind of like hidden way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=180.9s)]
*  We've been saying for a very long time that anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are one and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  the same, and this is exactly what we're seeing right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=186.74s)]
*  The truth is coming out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  They don't want Israel to exist, and we need to fight this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  I want to say one more thing about that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=192.9s)]
*  Nihad Awad, okay, he was talking about Gazan people walking on their land. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=194.9s)]
*  They're denying Jewish nativity and ingenuity in the land of Israel, which is absolutely [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=200.74s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to celebrate the birthday of a Jewish man who lived in Nazareth over [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=207.38s)]
*  two thousand years ago, and they're trying to tell us that Jews have not been in Israel [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=211.46s)]
*  since before 1948. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=215.38s)]
*  This is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm very happy that that organization was removed from anything that has to do with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=219.18s)]
*  the White House strategy on anti-Semitism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=223.14s)]
*  What do you make, Jason, of the Biden administration embracing the group care? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=225.54s)]
*  We know their history. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=229.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=231.14s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=232.14s)]
*  There's no justification, and they're not the only ones. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=235.86s)]
*  The interns and the other people and the staff in the White House have also been problematic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=238.18s)]
*  You know, Adolf Hitler killed millions of Jews, and he slaughtered millions of ethnic [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  minorities, and he did it with the justification that he needed this genocide to help cleanse [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=249.18s)]
*  the earth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=253.74s)]
*  And yet, Hamas takes this same position, and these university professors, the care and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  others say that, well, you just have to put it in context. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=260.7s)]
*  And so they went out and slaughtered another 1,300 people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=265.1s)]
*  And then they say that proudly, and they think that the people of Harvard and the students [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=268.94s)]
*  of Harvard, that that's not a hate crime or that's not threatening or intimidating to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=273.14000000000004s)]
*  go out and say, you know, we really should carry on, because what they are advocating [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=278.1s)]
*  for is exactly what was advocated for by Adolf Hitler. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=282.04s)]
*  They claim the same types of things, and they should be just absolutely, they've got to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=286.42s)]
*  deport the people that are here that are guests of the United States, and they've [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=292.5s)]
*  got to get serious about cleaning this up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=296.82s)]
*  But the White House, it's an embarrassment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=298.66s)]
*  Can't allow it to happen for sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=300.74s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=302.06s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=303.06s)]
