# Stephen Miller: Joe Biden is a ‘criminal’
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o)
*  Joe Biden inherited the most secure border in American history, but since his very first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=0.0s)]
*  day in office, Biden has done everything to dismantle Trump-era policies, the ones that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  worked that kept the border safe and secure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=12.6s)]
*  But only now, with reelection looming, all of a sudden the same Joe Biden has been lying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=15.56s)]
*  to us, as everybody in the administration has been lying to us, telling us the border's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=20.94s)]
*  closed, the border's secure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=24.92s)]
*  Now he's claiming he wants to do something about the problem he himself created. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=26.68s)]
*  And a bipartisan group of senators has been working on a so-called deal to trade enhanced [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=31.96s)]
*  border security for more aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=37.58s)]
*  And while we don't know all the details, because they haven't put it in writing yet, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=40.36s)]
*  we do know that Biden falsely claims that the bill would enable him to shut down the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  border. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=47.88s)]
*  One problem. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=48.88s)]
*  Sources telling Fox News that provision would only kick in once several thousand people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=49.88s)]
*  cross each and every day, which, as Speaker Mike Johnson rightly points out, is ridiculous, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=54.56s)]
*  outrageous, a non-starter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  This bill is DOA in the House. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=62.56s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump has also weighed in, and he is telling Republican senators [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=65.6s)]
*  not to give in and support a weak bill that will allow the surge of illegals to continue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=69.92s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=75.76s)]
*  Here are all the Trump policies that Joe Biden reversed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=77.0s)]
*  He can fix all of this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=80.76s)]
*  He did this all with the stroke of a pen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=82.2s)]
*  He can undo them with the stroke of a pen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=84.44s)]
*  Congressional action is not required. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=86.96s)]
*  Just bring back the Trump policies that worked. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=89.78s)]
*  And things at the border are only getting worse and worse. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=92.38s)]
*  Our very own Sarah Carter, she was in Eagle Pass today speaking with the Texas Department [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=95.2s)]
*  of Public Safety. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=100.44s)]
*  Let's get an update. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  Because of what we've been able to do as a state, National Guard, DPS, we have secured [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  this area here in Shelby Park, Eagle Pass, which has been known for years that this is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=108.76s)]
*  the place to cross. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=113.64s)]
*  If you look at all the physical barriers that National Guard put up, this is a deterrent. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=114.64s)]
*  This is what we need. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  This goes back to show you that walls do actually work. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Physical barriers actually work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=122.28s)]
*  We've never been in a situation like this, not only where we're having to defend our [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=123.68s)]
*  state and our border, but now also, you know, this conflict, this alleged conflict between [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  us and federal agents, which is not even there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=134.6s)]
*  But again, it all goes back to show you what the priorities are for this federal government. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=137.34s)]
*  Their priorities are to allow as many people into the country as possible and also to create [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=141.1s)]
*  this narrative or this conflict between us and law enforcement, federal law enforcement, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=145.02s)]
*  which is not the case. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=150.22s)]
*  And I think right there really shows you where their priorities are and really what they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=151.22s)]
*  should be focusing on is securing the border. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=154.78s)]
*  They have the authority to do that, but they refuse to do that right now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=160.54s)]
*  Sarah Carter is live from the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, along with former senior advisor [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=161.9s)]
*  to President Trump Stephen Miller is with us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=166.7s)]
*  Sarah, let's be very clear here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=169.1s)]
*  The media mob is lying as usual and the Democrats are lying as usual and Joe Biden is lying [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=171.46s)]
*  as per usual. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  First of all, the very people that have been telling us the border is secure and closed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  now at least recognize a problem. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=182.3s)]
*  However, they are lying and saying that they need legislation to fix the problem. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=185.06s)]
*  As I've been scrolling, Joe Biden's rescinding of Trump era policies that worked contributed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  to all of it and his aiding and abetting illegal immigrants. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=198.42s)]
*  That just added to the problem. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=202.66s)]
*  Him telling them to come, which he also did, also contributed to the problem. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=204.18s)]
*  So all of this is on him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=210.94s)]
*  Why is the media buying this lie? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=211.94s)]
*  Why are they perpetrating this lie? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, the media can perpetrate and buy this lie all they want, Sean, but the American [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=217.54s)]
*  people aren't buying it because they see it every single day. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Not only here at the border where you can see the concertina wire right behind me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=225.78s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott has reinforced it today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=229.78s)]
*  In fact, even the National Guard was out continuing to put up reinforcements. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=233.26s)]
*  The Texas National Guard. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=238.5s)]
*  But the American people can see what's happening because they see the illegal migrants being [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=240.06s)]
*  shipped off into housing facilities in Chicago, in airports like in Boston, in New York, where [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=244.36s)]
*  we've been, Sean, where we showed you right over at Floyd Bennett Field, where over 2000 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=252.28s)]
*  migrants are being housed. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=258.36s)]
*  And they can see the extreme nature of this situation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=260.12s)]
*  We're right here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=262.92s)]
*  Even in Eagle Pass, they've had people coming from these are called special interest aliens, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=264.12s)]
*  people from Iraq, people from Syria, people from Pakistan that haven't been properly vetted. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=269.02000000000004s)]
*  And from all over the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=274.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolutely insane. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=275.61999999999995s)]
*  And I got to tell you, what is so incredible is our. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=277.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=281.73999999999995s)]
*  Finish your thought. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  What's so incredible? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=283.84s)]
*  What I want to make clear is that what's so incredible is that our Border Patrol, our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=284.84s)]
*  National Guard, our Texas DPS, even on the very local level here in the county, the police [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=289.38s)]
*  officers that are working here in Texas, they are working together and they know that this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=295.7s)]
*  is working. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=301.14s)]
*  That is the reason why you're not seeing anybody coming over here and trying to cut this concertina [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=302.2s)]
*  wire. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=307.52s)]
*  I mean, it's not going to happen unless, like what you said to Governor Greg Abbott, unless [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=308.52s)]
*  for some reason, President Biden decides to federalize, you know, the National Guard and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=313.64s)]
*  tries to force them to do that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=319.34s)]
*  And really, that will corner President Biden and it will. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=321.36s)]
*  Well, first, I got to give a lot of props out to the to the Border Patrol agents that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=325.24s)]
*  are saying, no, we support the Texas National Guard. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=331.36s)]
*  We're grateful for their help and assistance and their hard work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=333.92s)]
*  Got to give them credit. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=337.04s)]
*  I don't think I don't think Joe's going to be successful federalizing the Texas National [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=338.04s)]
*  Guard. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=342.44s)]
*  Just my gut feeling. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=343.44s)]
*  And he's he's he's literally pitting law enforcement against law enforcement. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=344.52s)]
*  Very dangerous. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=349.36s)]
*  However, they're not they're not allowing themselves to be put in the middle here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=350.36s)]
*  Good for them on both sides. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=353.7s)]
*  Steve Miller, what's your take on all of this? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=356.44s)]
*  Well, Sean, I think you've done a tremendous public service tonight by listing all of the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=358.76s)]
*  actions that Joe Biden terminated that President Trump used to achieve the most secure border [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  in American history. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=371.62s)]
*  President Trump ultimately implemented over one thousand executive actions to secure the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=374.24s)]
*  border and to secure this nation's immigration system. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=379.94s)]
*  Many people know the most famous ones remain in Mexico. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  Safe Thirds, Border Wall, Title 42, Border Prosecutions, immediate expulsion from the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=387.44s)]
*  country, rapid deportations, ending catch and release, detained through removal. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden came into office and willfully terminated every single one of these policies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=399.8s)]
*  And he and Mayorkas violated the command in federal law and the very act that created [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=404.56s)]
*  homeland security to guard this nation's borders and to deter and prevent unlawful [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=409.96s)]
*  entries into this country. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=415.2s)]
*  They are criminals. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=417.28s)]
*  Joe Biden is a criminal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=418.28s)]
*  Mayorkas is a criminal breaking federal law every single day. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=419.68s)]
*  And they can secure this border with a one sentence EO that says restore all Trump policies [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=422.76s)]
*  effective immediately. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=428.56s)]
*  The job that Speaker Johnson has is how can you force Joe Biden to do involuntarily that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=430.28s)]
*  that which he refuses to do but has the authority to do voluntarily? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=436.92s)]
*  That's why the House passed a real border security bill called H.R.2. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=442.04s)]
*  The U.S. Senate Republicans, all they need to do is agree with that part. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=447.88s)]
*  They don't need to be negotiating with Biden and Chuck Schumer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=452.48s)]
*  First of all, the House isn't going to go along with it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=456.16s)]
*  So I think they're wasting people's time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=458.04s)]
*  Sarah, we'll give you the last thought here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=460.64s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right, Sean. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=463.92s)]
*  I mean, look, that bill is going to allow at least 5000 people to come into this country [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=466.08s)]
*  illegally. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=471.24s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=472.24s)]
*  We know it's going to be a lot more than that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=473.24s)]
*  And that's day by day. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  And you know, it was Jay Johnson under Barack Obama that said when 1000 a day were coming [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=476.52s)]
*  over, it was a crisis. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=481.56s)]
*  So imagine that this is Biden's problem. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=483.28s)]
*  He's cornered himself and now he's going to pay the price for it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=485.96s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=489.96s)]
*  Beyond dangerous this country. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=490.96s)]
*  And I am telling you, Tara Selsi here, of the nearly 10 million unvetted, when you look [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=493.36s)]
*  at the countries they're coming from, one day he will have blood on his hands. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=498.92s)]
*  And I pray to God that I am wrong. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=502.92s)]
*  No doubt, Sean. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=504.72s)]
*  But I don't think I am. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=505.72s)]
*  Sadly. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=507.92s)]
*  That's a clear and present danger. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=509.16s)]
*  These FBI guys were right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcykDAck_o&t=510.44s)]
