# Newt Gingrich: Hunter Biden indictment shows first family akin to TV mob clan
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA)
*  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is now crediting the brave IRS whistleblowers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=0.0s)]
*  for holding the Justice Department accountable and forcing them to take action. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=6.92s)]
*  He's 100 percent right. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=11.96s)]
*  Anyway, here with more reaction is former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=13.36s)]
*  They said, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=17.32s)]
*  Two brave whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, placed their careers on the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=18.32s)]
*  line to blow the whistle on misconduct and how things have been politicized in the Hunter [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=22.8s)]
*  Biden criminal investigation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=28.44s)]
*  The DOJ got caught in its attempt to give Hunter Biden an unprecedented sweetheart deal, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=30.36s)]
*  and today's charges filed against Hunter are the result of Mr. Shapley and Mr. Ziegler's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=36.08s)]
*  efforts to ensure that all Americans are treated equally under the law. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=41.36s)]
*  Every American should applaud these men for their courage to expose the truth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  IRS whistleblowers also revealed that investigators were prevented from following evidence that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=50.44s)]
*  could have led to Joe Biden. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=55.88s)]
*  The House Oversight Committee's investigation of the Biden's influence-peddling schemes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=57.64s)]
*  reveals how Joe Biden knew about, participated in, benefited from family cashing in on Biden's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=62.36s)]
*  name. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=69.56s)]
*  In fact, Hunter Biden's corporate entities implicated by today's indictments funneled [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=70.56s)]
*  foreign cash that landed in Joe Biden's bank account, and unless U.S. Attorney Weiss [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=74.84s)]
*  investigates everyone involved in the Biden's fraud schemes and influence-peddling, it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=80.08s)]
*  will be clear that President Biden's DOJ is protecting Hunter Biden and the big guy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=85.28s)]
*  Your reaction to that, Newt Gingrich? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=90.8s)]
*  Well, look, I think at a practical level, when you look at all the information, what [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=92.8s)]
*  you have is essentially what I called in a recent newsletter the Delaware Sopranos. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=101.4s)]
*  This is a crime family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=108.38s)]
*  out the interests of the United States. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=111.36s)]
*  As somebody said the other day, you now have in effect a Chinese-Russian paid agent sitting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=114.0s)]
*  in the Oval Office. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  It's very hard for me to think that any normal person looking at the amount of evidence [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=125.08s)]
*  that every single day gets bigger—and Chairman Comer has been a part of that and has done [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=132.0s)]
*  a good job of digging into this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=137.48s)]
*  You also have people at the Ways and Means Committee. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=140.32s)]
*  You have people with Jim Jordan at the Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=142.88s)]
*  Every day something new comes out, and presently you're going to have such an enormous mound [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=146.88s)]
*  of evidence that it's going to be very hard for reasonable people to not at least say [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=152.92s)]
*  we need to know what's going on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  I'll be very curious as all of this develops whether there won't be some Democrats who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=161.56s)]
*  vote for the impeachment process when it comes to the floor of the House. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=167.6s)]
*  And I can't imagine, given everything which has been surfaced, why any Republican would [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=173.04s)]
*  vote against—remember, we're not—this is not a vote on impeachment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=178.92s)]
*  It's a vote on investigating and using the system in order to bring to the surface things [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=181.84s)]
*  that at least today look like they're amazingly criminal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=189.0s)]
*  I won't repeat all the details that I gave Professor Dershowitz, but in the case of Burisma, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=193.16s)]
*  in the case of CEFC, the Chinese oil and gas conglomerate, and the sheer amount of millions [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=198.72s)]
*  we're talking about and no experience at all, and Joe's direct involvement in both [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  of those cases with China, the WhatsApp message, in Ukraine he leveraged the billion dollars [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=211.24s)]
*  to fire the prosecutor, I think that's pretty big evidence that he was involved, and of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=216.84s)]
*  course the big lie that he told that he never once talked about these issues with his son, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  brother, or anybody for that matter, that's been blown out of the water, and he made that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=226.44s)]
*  same lie again yesterday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=230.64s)]
*  Look, there are a couple clear things here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=232.12s)]
*  First, Joe Biden is a liar and a crook. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=236.04s)]
*  Second, there was an amazing amount of foreign influence pouring into this country from Kazakhstan, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  Romania, Ukraine, Russia, China. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=246.28s)]
*  This is clearly the biggest presidential scandal in American history in terms of sheer influence [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  peddling. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=256.88s)]
*  In addition, it's very clear, to me at least, that they built an entire structure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=258.12s)]
*  You have to say to yourself, why would they have all of these shell companies? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Why would they have this elaborate system of trying to hide what was going on? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=267.56s)]
*  We know more and more that there were all sorts of emails. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=272.04s)]
*  I saw one report today that Joe Biden, as vice president, may have sent several hundred [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  emails to various people who worked for one of the companies that Hunter had set up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=281.4s)]
*  But here's the bigger picture. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=289.0s)]
*  You can go around and you can go out this leaf or that leaf. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=290.84s)]
*  You can argue about this tree or that tree. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  But when you see the whole forest, it's pretty hard to reach any conclusion, except [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=296.4s)]
*  these people methodically set out to make money doing things that they knew were wrong, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=302.48s)]
*  to take money from foreigners, including our major competitors in the world, and then [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  to methodically lie about it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=314.96s)]
*  I mean, it's very hard to look at the bigger picture and not reach that conclusion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=316.68s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=321.48s)]
*  Without two brave whistleblowers and one brave judge in Delaware, they would have gotten [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=323.32s)]
*  away with all of it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=328.4s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=329.8s)]
*  Speaker, Newt Gingrich, thank you so much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei7BxLa8_rA&t=330.8s)]
