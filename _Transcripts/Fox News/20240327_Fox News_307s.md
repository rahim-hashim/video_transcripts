# Kristi Noem: People are rallying around a man who fights for America
**Fox News:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM)
*  Biden campaign is now so desperate. Some are floating a walk down memory lane to the dog days [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=0.0s)]
*  of COVID. Now, Biden himself has even recently invoked the pandemic. And the president wants you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  to forget the mask mandates, the vaccine mandates, the lockdowns, the school closures, the mass [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  hysteria. He certainly doesn't want you to remember that more people died in 2021 under his watch than [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  died in the year that it started in January of 2020 as he lives in the past. After all, it was a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=25.6s)]
*  better time for Joe Biden. It was the beginning of his presidency and the last time his poll numbers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=33.28s)]
*  were significantly underwater. Well, anyways, far left policies had yet to wreak havoc on you, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=38.64s)]
*  every American, and here with more, a governor who has kept South Dakota free, Kristi Noem is with us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=45.44s)]
*  By the way, congratulations. Although you are number one, North Dakota beat you by one-tenth [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=52.8s)]
*  of a point when it comes to having the lowest unemployment in the country. I'm sure that kind [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=58.8s)]
*  of irritated you. That would irritate me. Just a little bit, just a little bit. Yes, of course, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=64.0s)]
*  we're always competitive with other states, but you were talking about COVID and I was just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=70.08s)]
*  remembering back to those first days of COVID. And I thank God that President Trump was the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=74.64s)]
*  president and was in the White House during that time because he actually let me as governor do my [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=78.4s)]
*  job. He let me be governor, make decisions for our people that were the best for our state. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=83.36s)]
*  And our state is thriving today because of that. Everybody's working. They're earning a lot more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  income. Women-owned businesses are doing better. We've got historic revenues and visitation, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  people moving in. We're growing and it's all because President Trump was in the White House. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=97.84s)]
*  And we've only seen our country decline since Joe Biden has been the administration that I have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=101.04s)]
*  to get up and fight every day. So if Biden wants to go back and visit COVID, boy, if I got some [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=106.32s)]
*  stories of what happened on day one when Joe Biden took over the White House because our military [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  declined, he attacked our people, he tried to mandate vaccines and masks and hurt our children [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=114.8s)]
*  and set them back. It was tragic what his policies did to this country. With 222 days outside of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Election Day, how do you assess the race right now? Gosh, freedom is doing well. I think that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  it's resonating with people and they recognize that the only person that's going to keep them [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=134.64s)]
*  free is President Donald J. Trump. So that's what I think is amazing is that you see people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  rallying around a man that gets up every day and fights for America. What America meant [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=143.04s)]
*  back when our founders brought it forward and gave us our constitution, and he's the only one that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  stood there and defended our freedom of speech, our freedom of assembly, our freedom of religion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's what's great. We just got to keep talking to them. So I'm spending a lot of time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=156.88s)]
*  in a lot of these states that need to make up their minds and that we have to win in order to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=159.76s)]
*  win the presidency. And that's Michigan and Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio. Spent [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=163.84s)]
*  a lot of time in Ohio helping in that Senate race there. That all affects who wins the White House [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=168.88s)]
*  too. So there's a lot of work to do. I think that we're looking good, but that means we double down [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=173.2s)]
*  and we press our foot on the gas. The Democrats seem focused on a very aggressive strategy now, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=178.72s)]
*  probably at a panic more than anything else. And that's attack Trump, attack Trump, democracy, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=185.84s)]
*  imperil, January 6th, lying and demagoguing about abortion, trying to convince people that he's done [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=190.72s)]
*  a great job. I don't think that's going to resonate at all. And as I'm watching the campaign, then I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=198.56s)]
*  think of two advantages that they might have. Democrats are not resistant at all to voting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=205.12s)]
*  early, voting by mail. They have pretty much mastered the laws where you're allowed to have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=211.2s)]
*  legal ballot harvesting. Republicans, and I know Laura Trump is working on this, but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=218.0s)]
*  222 days, it's a heavy lift to match, hopefully surpass, Democratic issues on that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=223.6s)]
*  Where do you stand on it? Should Republicans get over their reluctance and resistance to voting [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=230.32s)]
*  early and by mail? Do they have to do a better job of legal ballot harvesting? And how do you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=236.0s)]
*  accomplish that in that short period of time? You work with the laws that you have in your state, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=241.04s)]
*  and you make sure that your secretary of state is following the laws, and then you go hard, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=246.72s)]
*  and you make sure that we win overwhelmingly in these states, and that it isn't a slim margin [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=249.92s)]
*  that we win by, that we win big, and we win big recognizing the difference in these candidates. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=254.48s)]
*  What the Democrats' playbook is, is they're going to take a gallon of gas and throw it on a candidate, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=259.04s)]
*  throw it on Donald J. Trump and light it on fire and try to burn him and his family and everybody [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=263.52s)]
*  close to him to the ground, and then manipulate and bend election laws in every single state [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=267.28s)]
*  how they can. We have to be smarter, faster, work harder, and we're going to have to spend [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=273.2s)]
*  some resources to get it done. That's the problem that we face right now, is that they're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=277.6s)]
*  strategically going after Trump so that he's spending his money on legal battles, and they're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=281.92s)]
*  putting money in Joe Biden's campaign account to come after our freedom. Yeah, all right. Governor, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em65b-jFluM&t=287.44s)]
