# Hannity: Dems are just screaming into the void
**Fox News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk)
*  But first, let's check in on the Democratic Party, shall we? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=0.0s)]
*  Which has now moved. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=3.74s)]
*  First, they were in the denial stage after the election. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=4.74s)]
*  They couldn't believe they lost. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=7.34s)]
*  Then they were in the grief and depression stage. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=8.78s)]
*  Now they have officially entered the rage and anger stage, which is where they usually [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=12.48s)]
*  are with President Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=18.14s)]
*  Not much of a change, which, by the way, I'm perfectly fine with, if that's where they [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=19.54s)]
*  want to be. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=23.34s)]
*  And I hate to break it to our friends in the radical, new, left-wing, socialized Democratic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=24.42s)]
*  Party, but they are screaming into a void at this point. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  Same with their allies and co-workers and the state-run legacy media mob. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=34.96s)]
*  They lost the election, their approval numbers are nearing record lows, and yet they continue [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=40.1s)]
*  to fight two losing battles. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=44.44s)]
*  The first one is over illegal immigration. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=46.36s)]
*  Outside of a tiny group of Democrats, almost everyone in America wants Donald Trump to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=48.8s)]
*  deport illegal immigrants, those that are murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=53.32s)]
*  known terrorists in our country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=59.76s)]
*  They're the only ones fighting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=61.2s)]
*  Oh, it's not a big deal? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=63.88s)]
*  Yes, it is a big deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=64.88s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=66.12s)]
*  They should stay on this, the biggest losing battle of all time in D.C., and it surrounds [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=67.12s)]
*  the government accountability. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=72.48s)]
*  In fact, Democrats are outraged. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=73.72s)]
*  We are in a constitutional crisis that Donald Trump and Elon Musk are exposing what is their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=76.44s)]
*  massive amounts of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse that are given to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=83.24s)]
*  other countries to spread their ideology. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=88.44s)]
*  You know, how dare Donald Trump and Elon Musk tell the American people the truth and be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=91.52s)]
*  transparent? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=96.28s)]
*  The Democratic Party is now apparently willing to fight tooth and nail against government [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=97.28s)]
*  oversight? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=101.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=102.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=103.84s)]
*  Elon Musk is seizing the power that belongs to the American people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=105.44s)]
*  We are here to fight back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=113.12s)]
*  Anytime a person can pay $250 million into a campaign and they be given access, full [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=115.64s)]
*  access to the Department of Treasury of the United States of America, we are at war. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=123.44s)]
*  I am going to stand with you in this fight, and we will win. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=130.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=134.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  We will win. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  No, you lost, but who's counting? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  Despite the theatrics, Elon Musk, Doge are doing incredible work for the Trump administration [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  and, frankly, for the American people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=158.28s)]
*  I mean, they're robbing from our kids and grandkids to advance their extreme agenda. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=160.4s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=164.6s)]
*  They utterly exposed USA, you know, which long served. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=165.84s)]
*  This was their slush fund for the far-left actors out of Washington to give to their, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=169.76s)]
*  you know, friends around the globe, spending your billions and billions of hard-earned [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=176.32s)]
*  on the woke causes, the Green New Deal causes, the, you know, the transgender ideology, DEI, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=181.76s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=188.92s)]
*  Doge is expanding to other parts now of the federal government, including the Transportation [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Department. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=194.6s)]
*  The status quo in D.C., it is over. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=195.6s)]
*  Shock and awe has arrived. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=198.12s)]
*  Democrats, they are sadly stuck in the past and don't expect them to change over the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=199.92s)]
*  next four years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=204.12s)]
*  Didn't take long. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=205.12s)]
*  It did not take long. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=206.12s)]
*  I was ready to start a Hannity.com poll. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=207.72s)]
*  Who will be the first Democratic elected official? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  Who's going to be the first legacy media mob person, you know, to call for this? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=215.0s)]
*  Sixteen days in, I didn't think it would be that quick. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Al Green filing another round of impeachment articles against Donald [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  Trump for his dastardly deeds. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=229.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=231.48s)]
*  Dr. King was right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=232.48s)]
*  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=234.8s)]
*  And injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  I rise to announce that the movement to impeach the president has begun. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=244.84s)]
*  I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=259.64s)]
*  All right, the anger, the fear mongering doesn't stop there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=264.16s)]
*  Now Democrats, the media mob are once again outraged over Trump's bold new plan for Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=267.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=274.36s)]
*  It's right now a demolition site. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  This is just a demolition site. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  Virtually every building is down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=284.88s)]
*  They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=287.24s)]
*  They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=299.64s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=304.48s)]
*  Now like Trump's tariff threats and tough negotiations with Panama, Venezuela, Denmark, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=310.72s)]
*  Canada, this is likely just the first chapter in a complex ongoing art of the deal negotiation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=317.08s)]
*  But once again for the millionth time the Democratic Party has just overcome with hysteria. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=325.12s)]
*  You decide. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=329.56s)]
*  I think it's the craziest idea I've ever heard in my life. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=330.56s)]
*  Two million people living in Gaza, a problem that Israel has and now we're going to have. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=333.4s)]
*  We want to own Gaza. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=339.28s)]
*  You've got something like two million Gazans there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  More than half of them do not support Hamas right now but the moment you tell them that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=344.4s)]
*  you've got to leave because of a U.S. plan backed by Israel, every single one will join [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=348.28s)]
*  Hamas and fight. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=353.32s)]
*  We have known that this is Trump's plan for the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=354.32s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  It is the definition of ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  It is part of the culmination of what I view to be genocide of Palestinian people. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=363.0s)]
*  It's delusional. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  It's also dangerous and it is disgustingly insensitive to Palestinian humanity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=370.28s)]
*  Clearly there is now, it's an official foreign policy of the United States, the illegal occupation [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=376.44s)]
*  of a sovereign land, ethnic cleansing which constitute both, on both counts, crimes against [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=382.84s)]
*  humanity. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing when you promise that you're going to help clear out the rubble from the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  region and put people in nice homes, that's ethnic cleansing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=397.0s)]
*  See the same cycle over and over and over again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=401.68s)]
*  Wash runs repeat. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=404.76s)]
*  The American people no longer care about the constant hysteria. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=405.8s)]
*  They trust President Trump to improve our country, fix what's broken, drain the swamp [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=409.36s)]
*  and protect American lives from threats both foreign and domestic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=413.56s)]
*  Unlike the last administration, Trump knows how to work with our friends, hold our enemies [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=417.96s)]
*  in check. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=422.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=423.6s)]
*  Why say that you're unhappy to sign it if it's Iran and their prophecies who have threatened [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  to retaliate against you and your team by killing you guys for taking out Soleimani? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=430.24s)]
*  Well, they haven't done that and that would be a terrible thing for them to do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZM3-IygRtk&t=435.96000000000004s)]
