# 'FAKE JAKE': CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticized for activist journalism
**Fox News:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8)
*  here now with more on our top story. Fox News contributors, Joe Concha and Charlie Hurt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. Can we all agree, both Joe and Charlie, that fake Jake is not a journalist? He is a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=6.24s)]
*  liberal leftist talk show host. I can pull more tape night after night after night to prove it to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=13.44s)]
*  the country. He has to be off the list. Agreed? Joe, we'll start with you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=19.52s)]
*  Thank you. Agreed. Jake Tapper has said publicly, Sean, that Trump is a threat to democracy and has [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=23.76s)]
*  a, quote, disdain for democracy. Never says that about Joe Biden for some reason. And as you just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  showed, Tapper has ordered his own control room to not show Trump speaking live. This is an [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=34.72s)]
*  activist you're looking on your screen, not a journalist, and he's a narcissistic performer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=40.96s)]
*  more than anyone that we can see at that network. Now, as for Trump, by calling this bluff, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  what this shows, Sean, is that Donald Trump is absolutely fearless, and he has no fear of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=51.12s)]
*  Joe Biden whatsoever, especially this version of this 81-year-old president. And it shows panic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  in the Biden camp. You used the word before. It's the accurate word. After seeing more polls, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=60.48s)]
*  as you just showed, key swing states, but also Minnesota and Virginia are now a dead heat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=64.64s)]
*  No president Republican has won Minnesota since 1972. No one in the Republican party has won [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=71.6s)]
*  Virginia since 2004. Now, this first debate will be on CNN, as we just talked about, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=76.64s)]
*  and that's about as trustworthy as gas station sushi. This is the same network, you may recall, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=81.84s)]
*  who shared debate questions with Hillary Clinton in 2016 on two separate occasions. So given the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=86.48s)]
*  personal animus almost everyone at that network has for Trump, I mean, who's to say this isn't [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=93.28s)]
*  going to happen again? This is also the same network, by the way, that ousted its own president [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=97.12s)]
*  last year for the crime of giving Trump a town hall on its air. And that's all thanks to a mutiny [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=101.2s)]
*  among its journalists from within, starting with Jake Tapper. But on another front, Sean, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=106.08s)]
*  we need to watch what topics are chosen for this debate, because since the moderators are Tapper [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=110.0s)]
*  and Danabash, it is assured we're going to get a heavy dose of January 6th and Trump's legal trials [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=114.72s)]
*  and abortion with a capital A. So I'll leave it here, Sean. The most important issue for voters [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=119.44s)]
*  per Gallup right now are the following, economy, immigration, poor leadership in government, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=123.6s)]
*  poverty and homelessness and foreign policy. All of these issues are ones that voters see [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=128.0s)]
*  Trump being able to handle, particularly the border and economy far better than Joe Biden, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=133.6s)]
*  who won't have scripted remarks and a teleprompter to guide him for 90 minutes, regardless of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=138.48s)]
*  venue. And we've seen what happens when Joe Biden speaks without a teleprompter. It's cleanups on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=143.76s)]
*  aisles 5, 18 and 24. Okay. I also would add Charlie Hurt, that they've got to, they've got to pull [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=147.68s)]
*  these debates. Whoever is, has the debate, by the way, oops, my flag moved. Whoever has these debates, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=155.28s)]
*  it should be made available to everybody this way. Every network runs it, get the biggest possible [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=161.76s)]
*  audience so that we have a well-informed country before people start voting and go to the polls on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=166.96s)]
*  November 5th. Do you agree with that? And secondly, what about the gall of the media and the mob in the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=173.44s)]
*  media and Joe Biden thinking they can dictate the, all the terms for only four networks? I decide, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=181.12s)]
*  I make all the rules. We don't even ask Donald Trump and the networks go along with that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Sorry, that's never happened. That can happen here. And people like Fake Jake, as Joe pointed out, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  no, you don't put partisan liberal hoes to make it two on one. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Well, one of the great things about Donald Trump is that, you know, for a long time, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=209.68s)]
*  we've seen this kind of stuff from left-wing hacks in the media like Jake Tapper. But the problem [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=214.48s)]
*  for them right now with Donald Trump and the reason they hate Donald Trump so much is because [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  in a debate between Donald Trump and Jake Tapper, Donald Trump wins. Donald Trump has been destroying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  this media. This is, that's been his favorite thing to go after for eight years. And it's what has [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=234.64s)]
*  made him such a success in politics is that, you know, he's accustomed to going up against these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=242.24s)]
*  people who have absolutely filleted every Republican who's ever come along. And Donald Trump's first guy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=249.28s)]
*  that comes along and, you know, steps up to him and fights back, mano a mano. And so, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  I agree with everything you say there, but I also have a lot of faith that Donald Trump, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=263.52s)]
*  whoever the moderator is, Donald Trump is going to beat Joe Biden and then is also going to beat [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=268.48s)]
*  the moderator as well. And the moderator is going to try to rig this thing in every way they can. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=273.12s)]
*  And we've seen it. What I think is so interesting about this, you know, I think Joe Biden made this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  announcement this morning. It was his opening salvo. I think that you guys are exactly right, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=283.76s)]
*  that what he's hoping is that they'll wind up with fewer debates, even fewer debates, but at the most, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=289.36s)]
*  he'll agree to two. Trump, because he's used to walking into dens of his enemies, just is like, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=296.32s)]
*  okay, sure, I'll do whatever. But I think that Biden wants to do this early enough so that however [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  catastrophic this thing winds up being for him, it is that they're hoping that it'll sort of be [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=311.2s)]
*  forgotten by the time the election rolls around. And that's the other reason why they want to make [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  it virtual. They want to make it virtual because they don't want it to be a dramatic event so that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=322.24s)]
*  they're hoping people will forget it sooner. And Joe Biden has proved that he's willing to run [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=327.44s)]
*  campaigns virtually. They're talking about doing the convention virtually. Earlier, before any votes [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=332.0s)]
*  are cast is great. And by the way, they do CNN and ABC get a debate, Box gets their debate. Trump [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  agreed. Joe, are you afraid of Martha McCallum and Brett Baer? They deserve a debate. But all right, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  I got a roll, guys. Charlie, thank you. Joe, thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGv1d3T0d8&t=351.68s)]
