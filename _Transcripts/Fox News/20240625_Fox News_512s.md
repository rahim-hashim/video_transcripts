# Hannity: This debate is not Trump vs Biden
**Fox News:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=3.08s)]
*  The polls, they are officially closed in the state of New York, and soon maybe the fire [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=4.76s)]
*  alarms on Capitol Hill, maybe they can rest easy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  We are monitoring the results as they pour in, but far-left congressman Jamal Bowman [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=13.42s)]
*  is in real jeopardy of losing his reelection bid after getting primaried by someone, well, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=18.48s)]
*  slightly less radical. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=24.04s)]
*  Bowman, best known for tagging along with the squad, hating Israel, pleading guilty [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  to a misdemeanor for intentionally pulling a fire alarm inside the Capitol complex in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  what was an unsuccessful attempt to delay a funding bill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=37.12s)]
*  Now, Congressman Bowman also suggested that America deserves the border crisis we have. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=40.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Because of our evil capitalist ways. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  That's all coming up straight ahead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Also coming up, you will hear from the mother and the grandfather of 12-year-old Jocelyn [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=51.72s)]
*  Nungre, the latest victim of Joe Biden's border crisis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=57.4s)]
*  There has been a lot of them lately. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=61.8s)]
*  Now, we now know this innocent little girl was assaulted for hours and murdered under [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=63.4s)]
*  this bridge in Texas, but she fought back hard, according to new details that have emerged. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  The suspected killers, they are two Joe Biden, unvetted, illegal immigrants. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=75.72000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=81.68s)]
*  Why were they not vetted? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=82.68s)]
*  Why were they allowed in the country? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Why were they aided and vetted by the president? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=85.48s)]
*  But you have yet to hear a peep from your commander-in-chief, except another proclamation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=88.48s)]
*  last week about amnesty and more and more lies, how he secured the border. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=93.48s)]
*  What are we here? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=99.2s)]
*  The border's secure, the border's closed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=100.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  And he said it again last week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  I did it on my own. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=105.0s)]
*  No, you didn't, Joe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=106.0s)]
*  And that bill you were passing, the bipartisan bill, you have 5,000 people come in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=111.56s)]
*  That's not a border security bill. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=112.56s)]
*  Anyway, Joe now, of course, five-plus days in county, he's been in hiding. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=114.72s)]
*  Apparently the president of your country is not able to perform his regular duties, the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=119.28s)]
*  duties of his job, while also preparing for a 90-minute debate in friendly territory on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=124.64s)]
*  fake news CNN. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=131.0s)]
*  At least 16 aides are helping Biden prepare with mock debates and strategy sessions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=132.84s)]
*  Also, according to reports, Biden's intensive week-long debate prep at Camp David also includes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=138.72s)]
*  exercises where Biden practices standing up for a whole 90 minutes straight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=144.76s)]
*  Now, that would be the length of the debate. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=150.0s)]
*  Now, of course, we don't know everything that's happening at Camp David, and many [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=152.68s)]
*  Americans believe that Biden could be taking some kind of performance-enhancing drugs to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=156.72s)]
*  help his ailing memory and his poor stamina. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=162.44s)]
*  Now, Trump called on Joe Biden to take a drug test. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=164.68s)]
*  He said he'd do the same. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=168.24s)]
*  Now, today's flash poll on Hannity.com shows a vast majority of our viewers believe that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=170.24s)]
*  it's going to be a jacked-up, hypercaffeinated Joe that's going to show up at Thursday's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=175.76s)]
*  debate like the State of the Union, not the usual cognitive mess Joe. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=180.52s)]
*  You can still vote at Hannity.com. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=185.0s)]
*  We'll show you the results. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=187.24s)]
*  That's coming up at the end of the show. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=188.24s)]
*  Now, of course, we haven't seen jacked-up, hypercaffeinated Joe since the supercharged, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=190.12s)]
*  angry, yelling, screaming State of the Union address where he barely blinked and motored [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=194.92s)]
*  through his script in record time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Didn't even give the Speaker of the House time to introduce him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately for Joe, there will be no scripts at Thursday's debate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=205.64s)]
*  He will have to rely on his memory. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=209.88s)]
*  Luckily for Biden, he will probably get some help from the so-called moderators, fake Dana [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=211.96s)]
*  Bash, fake Jake Tapper, our two left-wing Democratic talk show hosts that hate Donald [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=216.68s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  And like so many with Trump Derangement Syndrome, they are quick to compare the former president [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  to Adolf Hitler. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=228.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=229.6s)]
*  The dehumanizing rhetoric of Adolf Hitler is once again alive and well on a national [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=230.96s)]
*  political stage, this time, of course, in the United States, this time given life by [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  former president and current Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  If you were to open up a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf, you would find the Nazi leader [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=245.88s)]
*  describing the mixing of non-Germans with Germans as poisoning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=251.1s)]
*  There's really no other way to say it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=256.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's language mirrors this directly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=258.36s)]
*  —longstanding anti-Semitic trope that the true allegiance for Jews is to their religion [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=261.44s)]
*  rather than their country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=267.24s)]
*  It was used in Nazi Germany to justify the arrest, persecutions and mass killings that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=268.84s)]
*  attempted extermination of the Jewish people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=273.7s)]
*  And Trump has been pushing this trope for years. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=276.7s)]
*  And according to fake news CNN, Tapper and Bash, they're just fair-minded journalists [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  with no political bias at all whatsoever. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=284.3s)]
*  Clearly, nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=287.02s)]
*  Was that opinion they were stating, or is that fact? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=289.74s)]
*  And because the structure of the debate, these two left-wing hacks, they will have the power [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=293.3s)]
*  to cut off Donald Trump, even mute his microphone, while offering real-time, hyperpartisan, on-air [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=298.14s)]
*  Chiron fact-checking when they have their truncated question up there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  For example, here's what you can expect from fake Jake Tapper based on this interview [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  with Laura Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=314.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=315.34s)]
*  —What we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=316.34s)]
*  —OK. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=321.7s)]
*  —That's what I'm referring to. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=322.7s)]
*  It makes me uncomfortable to watch the money on stage search for questions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=323.7s)]
*  —It's so amazing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=327.26s)]
*  It's so amazing to me that— [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=328.26s)]
*  —And try and figure out an answer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=329.26s)]
*  —A cognitive decline. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=331.26s)]
*  —Well, when you're trying to tell me that what I was suggesting was a stuttering— [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=332.26s)]
*  —I think that you were mocking his stutter. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=335.26s)]
*  —I have no idea, Joe Biden. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=336.26s)]
*  —Yeah, I think you were mocking his stutter. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=337.26s)]
*  And I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=338.26s)]
*  I have one last question for you, Laura. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=343.26s)]
*  You can't— [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=345.06s)]
*  —The same times on stage. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=346.06s)]
*  And it's very concerning to a lot of people that this could be the leader of the free world. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=347.06s)]
*  That is all I'm saying. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=352.06s)]
*  I genuinely feel sorry for Joe Biden. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=353.06s)]
*  —I appreciate it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure it was from a place of concern. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=356.5s)]
*  We all believe that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=357.5s)]
*  Laura Trump, thank you so much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=358.5s)]
*  —Good for Laura Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=359.5s)]
*  By the way, fake Jake, you still believe he's not in cognitive decline? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=361.5s)]
*  You really believe that? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=365.18s)]
*  You really believe that people are making fun of a stutter? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, anyway, there's a preview of the debate in a nutshell. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=369.38s)]
*  Joe Biden won't even need to say a word. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  Fake Jake and company, they'll do the heavy lifting for him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=374.54s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I don't think the network that brought you Nicholas Sandman and that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=378.22s)]
*  And the fiery but mostly peaceful protest banners. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=383.42s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=386.62s)]
*  Oh, it says right there, mostly peaceful. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=387.62s)]
*  Look at the fire raging behind the reporter. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=389.98s)]
*  The Russia collusion hoax for three long periods they peddled on fake news CNN. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=392.74s)]
*  The Hunter Biden laptop lie, you know, should be in charge of fact-checking anybody or anything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=397.42s)]
*  And stop lying that you're a journalist. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=403.14s)]
*  You're not journalists. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=405.18s)]
*  Sadly, fake news CNN also has total control over the questions, the onscreen graphics. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  Watch for their bias with that and pretty much everything else. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=412.38s)]
*  Most of the terms of this debate were dictated by Joe Biden and fake news CNN. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=416.1s)]
*  It has never, ever, ever been this way in the history of televised presidential debates. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=421.54s)]
*  And nobody in the mob and the media cares, just like they didn't care about the sham [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=427.34s)]
*  criminal trial or the sham valuation of Mar-a-Lago at 18 million. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=431.02s)]
*  Ironically, a civil case about valuations. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=436.42s)]
*  So this debate is not Trump versus Biden. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=440.18s)]
*  It's Trump versus Biden and fake Dana Bash and fake Jake Tapper and dozens of CNN producers [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=443.38s)]
*  and probably CNN management. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=450.62s)]
*  And in case Biden needs any more help, Hillary Clinton, she has graciously offered some unsolicited [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=453.0s)]
*  advice calling Trump a, quote, convicted criminal out for revenge. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=458.62s)]
*  Hillary, he's probably going to have that overturn, although I'm not sure Biden should [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=463.42s)]
*  be taking advice from somebody who will never, ever, ever, ever be called madam president. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=467.9s)]
*  Either way, Biden is in a great position to succeed in Thursday's CNN debate, as long [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  as he makes it through the full 90 minutes without keeling over. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=480.0s)]
*  Well, the mob and the media will declare him the winner just based on that low bar. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=484.46s)]
*  But of course, Joe Biden will need all the help he can get. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=489.7s)]
*  His campaign is in shambles. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=492.38s)]
*  And now, even Obama is worried that his so-called legacy will be ruined with another Trump term. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_rmzl5_VI&t=493.98s)]
