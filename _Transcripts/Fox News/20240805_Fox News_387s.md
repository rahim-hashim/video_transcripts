# ‘THIS IS MADNESS’: America ‘hides our head in the sand’
**Fox News:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I)
*  And this is a Fox News alert earlier today, an apparent rocket attack injuring several [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. service members at al-Assad airbase in Iraq. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=5.64s)]
*  This comes as the world remains on edge tonight, amid what is—what are heightening tensions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=9.92s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=15.22s)]
*  Iran is now reportedly preparing to retaliate against Israel after a series of high-profile [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=16.7s)]
*  assassinations of terrorist proxy leaders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=22.2s)]
*  They got the number four leader of Hamas, number three, number two, and they just took [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=25.8s)]
*  out the number one leader, the people responsible for killing what would be the equivalent of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=29.84s)]
*  40,000 Americans in a day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=34.4s)]
*  Adding to the pressure, Axios tonight reporting that Secretary of State Winken, Tony Blinken, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=36.64s)]
*  telling his counterparts in the G7 yesterday that Iran, in fact, will strike at any moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=42.44s)]
*  Now, these are very uncertain, chilling times, and under Biden and Harris, there's war in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=47.8s)]
*  the Middle East, and now a presidential candidate that denies the existence of radical Islamic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=53.36s)]
*  terrorists and is lecturing you to have the courage not to use that word. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=58.34s)]
*  Joining us now, someone who had to deal with threats like these his entire life, the author [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=63.32s)]
*  of the brand-new book From Hamas to America, My Story of Defying Terror, Facing the Unimaginable, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=68.28s)]
*  Finding Redemption in the Land of Opportunity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=74.48s)]
*  He's known as the son of Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=77.08s)]
*  Mosab Hassan Youssef is with us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Mosab, welcome back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=81.72s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=83.48s)]
*  Just for the record, you've been an American citizen for what, 20-some-odd years now, correct? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=84.48s)]
*  Mosab Hassan About 10 years now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=89.0s)]
*  Mosab Hassan Okay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=91.48s)]
*  But you've been in the country for 27, 20-some-odd years? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=92.48s)]
*  Mosab Hassan Since 2007. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=95.72s)]
*  Mosab Hassan Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=97.72s)]
*  So you grew up as the son of one of the founders of Hamas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=99.56s)]
*  The Hamas Charter calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  We have a presidential candidate that now says we should have the courage not to use [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  the term radical Islamic terrorism, yet who attacked us on 9-11? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  Who attacked Israel on October 7? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=117.74s)]
*  Mosab Hassan This is total denial. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=120.22s)]
*  And it's Kamala Harris' attempt to hide her head in the sand. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=125.13999999999999s)]
*  The Hamas on October 7 killed a Jewish minority in the Middle East by the name of Allah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=133.62s)]
*  Bill Laden, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, Salafi jihadists, Hezbollah, Ayatullah, Nasrallah, all of them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=141.58s)]
*  killed by the name of Allah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=150.34s)]
*  And the Jewish hatred and the non-Muslim hatred is rooted in Islam, in the Qur'an. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=153.18s)]
*  We have been saying this for so many years, but I think many politicians in this country [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  and many other countries have been compromised. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=167.74s)]
*  I don't know how, but their imposter is very suspicious why they want to legitimize [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=170.66s)]
*  the Islamic violence, as you know, this is part of our life, and we have to coexist with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  Islam the way it is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=184.06s)]
*  And we say, no, this is totally rejected, because the more we legitimize terrorism and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  violence, the more we ignite their lust for blood, and this is not acceptable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=191.76s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=197.76s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this administration surrender in the war on terror, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=200.76s)]
*  After Iran fired missiles, okay, the administration did help Israel defend itself, but said, take [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=206.76s)]
*  that as a win, don't retaliate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=212.28s)]
*  Well, to me, that only emboldens further attacks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=214.36s)]
*  But I would imagine this time, because we know, for example, the rocket that hit the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  soccer field that killed these Israeli children, that was an Iranian rocket. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=222.24s)]
*  We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds forces helped train and provide the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=227.4s)]
*  weaponry for October the 7th. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=232.9s)]
*  I could imagine, as Iran is firing missiles, they'll also be taking incoming from Hezbollah [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=234.96s)]
*  out of Lebanon in the north and from Hamas out of the south out of Gaza, which is a three-front [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=242.28s)]
*  war, and maybe even four fronts, if you add the Houthi rebels out of Yemen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=248.16s)]
*  I mean, that is an existential threat to Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=251.96s)]
*  Now, are they going to help Israel offensively win this war against radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=254.76s)]
*  or are they going to keep surrendering? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=261.52s)]
*  I would imagine keep surrendering and giving in to the radical base that Kamala wants to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=263.16s)]
*  vote for her. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=267.96s)]
*  Look, the crisis that we have right now, that we are at the verge of a regional war, is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=269.84s)]
*  the outcome of the American administration's hesitation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=276.4s)]
*  Iran is not—or the Islamic Republic, actually, and Ayatollah, they are not only attacking [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  To them, America is the great Satan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=292.28s)]
*  They always chant, Death to America, before they say, Death to Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  So this is a strategic enemy of the United States, first of all, and in fact, Israel [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=300.72s)]
*  is fighting on behalf of the United States in that region. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=306.0s)]
*  Now, after October 7th and this hesitant policy towards the Middle East, which basically we [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=310.6s)]
*  see Iran about to obtain a new, clear weapon, and they already have ballistic missiles, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=316.44s)]
*  they have been destabilizing the region through their proxies, but also they can reach Europe, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  they can reach all the American interests in the Middle East, and we hide our head in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=328.32s)]
*  the sand and we let them go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  They are not that far from achieving a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=336.76s)]
*  We want to give Ayatollah a mass destruction weapon, and we are watching it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=340.04s)]
*  We see his nuclear program, and we are in total denial. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  This is complete madness. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Mossad Yousef, From Hamas to America, My Story of Defying Terror, Facing the Unimaginable, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=353.71999999999997s)]

*  around the country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=365.32s)]
*  I hope Kamala Harris listens to you, but she won't. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=370.88s)]
*  Appreciate the warning and the heads up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=371.88s)]
*  You know more than anybody. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=373.12s)]
*  The most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=381.4s)]
