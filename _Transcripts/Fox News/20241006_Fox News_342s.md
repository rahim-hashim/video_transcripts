# This is the ‘worst disaster’ I have ever seen: Sen. Ted Budd
**Fox News:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE)
*  forcing people to cling to anything for dear life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=0.0s)]
*  Our very own Sarah Carter was in the Tar Heel State today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=3.6s)]
*  She spoke to local residents. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=6.94s)]
*  Many of them are mad, rightly so. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=8.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=10.72s)]
*  Tell me what it was like. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=12.0s)]
*  It was actually pretty scary. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=13.32s)]
*  I didn't really think it was gonna be anything, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=16.0s)]
*  just like a normal storm or something, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=18.18s)]
*  and all of a sudden it just got crazy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=19.72s)]
*  Well, after it got started, then, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=21.82s)]
*  I mean, it was on the roofs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=24.82s)]
*  It covered a lot of the buildings, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=26.32s)]
*  like the building over there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  It was on the rooftops. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=29.74s)]
*  The biggest thing is we were worried for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  family outside of the area that didn't know we were safe [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=33.46s)]
*  and not being able to let them know we were safe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=35.82s)]
*  Any support that we needed here, you know, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=37.62s)]
*  there's a lot of people that have absolutely nothing, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=40.5s)]
*  have lost their families and stuff. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=42.66s)]
*  And I mean, you know, we need anything and everything [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=44.22s)]
*  that they, you know, are willing to do or give. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=47.04s)]
*  I got out immediately [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=50.34s)]
*  and I got out into the storm to see what was going on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  And I saw all that and we went in the other end of the house [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=56.82s)]
*  and we've been living in the kitchen actually [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=60.86s)]
*  and sleeping on the floor in the kitchen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=62.58s)]
*  since this happened. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=65.5s)]
*  And thank God Samaritan's Purse got here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=67.22s)]
*  What's been incredible to me [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=71.58s)]
*  is how the community has pulled together. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  Samaritan's Purse, this Franklin Graham, Billy Graham, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=75.58s)]
*  this is your home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=78.82s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=80.22s)]
*  Samaritan's Purse is headquartered in Boone, North Carolina [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=81.98s)]
*  and all of the staff live in the surrounding areas, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=84.98s)]
*  the mountain towns. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  And so we're used to deploying supplies internationally [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  in different parts of the United States [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=94.26s)]
*  where disasters of this level are so common. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=95.94s)]
*  For it to hit home made it much more personal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=99.06s)]
*  But the mission stays the same. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=102.34s)]
*  Finally, Joe Biden got off the beach [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=105.78s)]
*  and visited North Carolina today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=107.5s)]
*  He was briefed on the recovery effort in Raleigh [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=109.22s)]
*  after flying over some of the worst damage further west. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=111.5s)]
*  Which remember two days after Katrina, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=115.06s)]
*  George W. Bush got vilified for. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  He continues to maintain that the federal government [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=119.9s)]
*  is doing all it can to support the victims. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=121.98s)]
*  Federal troops and helicopters finally now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  are being deployed to help the victims. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=126.5s)]
*  It's nearly a week later. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=128.38s)]
*  According to North Carolina Senator Ted Budd, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=130.1s)]
*  quote, every North Carolinian I have talked to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=132.38s)]
*  is frustrated by the government's horrific response. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=134.9s)]
*  Now, thanks to Donald Trump's good friend, Elon Musk, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=138.58s)]
*  thankfully Starlink is finally available [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  in impacted areas that have not had communications [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=144.38s)]
*  for over a week. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=147.38s)]
*  Now, where was Joe Biden when the crisis began on the beach? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  Where was Kamala Harris in Hollywood, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  you know, raising money from her friends there? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  North Carolina Senator Ted Budd is with us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  Senator Furst, our condolences to the people [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  of the great state of North Carolina. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  You know what's amazing to me, Senator, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=164.1s)]
*  as I look at all of this and you say [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=166.38s)]
*  that you're frustrated and everybody you talk to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=168.06s)]
*  is frustrated by the slow response. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=170.06s)]
*  And then I look at, you know, you went on to say [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=172.62s)]
*  it's clear and it has been clear from the beginning [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=176.82s)]
*  that federal resources were needed to access communities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=179.5s)]
*  Now, but for Franklin Graham, Samirin's purse, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=182.86s)]
*  Donald Trump calling Elon Musk and Starlink, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=186.82s)]
*  you know, I don't know if there would have been any help [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=190.54s)]
*  at all and Joe Biden today's talking about climate change. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=192.82s)]
*  How about we talk about saving lives, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=197.46s)]
*  getting communication, water and supplies to people? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  Sean, that just shows how out of touch he is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=205.34s)]
*  But before we get into that, and you don't, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=207.3s)]
*  this is not a time for political grandstanding. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=209.5s)]
*  This is a time, first of all, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=212.06s)]
*  to let the people of North Carolina know [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=213.5s)]
*  how much we love them, how much I love them, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=215.94s)]
*  how much we're doing to work for them, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=217.9s)]
*  to bring as many resources as fast as we can. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=219.82s)]
*  And absolutely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=222.9s)]
*  So I've been on the ground at Katrina. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=224.02s)]
*  I was doing relief work at Hurricane Floyd [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=226.18s)]
*  and I was doing it 25 years ago. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=229.14s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=231.42s)]
*  So this is a 500, a thousand year incident. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=233.78s)]
*  We pray it never happens again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=237.06s)]
*  But these are resilient people in Western North Carolina. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=239.14s)]
*  And yes, there are other states too. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=242.62s)]
*  And we pray for them as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=244.22s)]
*  I'm talking to my colleagues in those other states. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  And this is the worst disaster I have ever seen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=248.42s)]
*  But God bless groups like Samirin's purse, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  his son, Ed Graham, others that are stepping up, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=255.9s)]
*  bringing in the military discipline and the speed [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=259.14s)]
*  and the generosity and serving in the name of Jesus [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  to make things better for people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=266.14s)]
*  in Western North Carolina. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  So I would say let's reach out to these private groups. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=269.18s)]
*  If people wanna come and help, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=273.86s)]
*  go through the American Red Cross, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=275.54s)]
*  volunteer through Samirin's purse, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=277.26s)]
*  come through, go through a local church or organization. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=279.18s)]
*  It's the private citizens that are stepping up right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=283.46s)]
*  I saw a group the other day, Operation Airdrop, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=286.38s)]
*  private citizens with small airplanes, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=289.06s)]
*  people who spent their life savings [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=290.94s)]
*  to make the dream come true [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  and be able to fly a small helicopter [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=293.62s)]
*  are risking themselves, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=295.7s)]
*  bringing their own personal equipment here [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=298.18s)]
*  and doing rescues. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=300.14s)]
*  And they're taking these star links [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  that Elon Musk has generously donated. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=303.46s)]
*  They're flying them into isolated volunteer, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=305.7s)]
*  volunteer fire departments [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=310.26s)]
*  that are connecting neighborhoods and communities [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=311.74s)]
*  that are otherwise cut off. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=314.02s)]
*  Well, I'm not asking people to do something I myself did. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=316.26s)]
*  I sent a donation to Samirin's purse. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=320.5s)]
*  It's samirinspurse.org. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=323.06s)]
*  We'll continue to follow the story, Senator, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=325.26s)]
*  and our prayers are with the people of North Carolina. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19_grgxKTeE&t=327.42s)]
