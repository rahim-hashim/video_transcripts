# Gov. Brian Kemp: You’ve got to be ready when you know these storms are coming
**Fox News:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA)
*  Governor Kemp is with us now. Governor, first, our sympathies for my friends in Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=0.0s)]
*  As you know, I lived there four years, have a lot of friends there. You ran into a little [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=4.8s)]
*  bit of a problem. I know it got straightened out. But initially, you wanted 90 counties [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=9.6s)]
*  declared a disaster area. They only declared 11. Then you went back, and then they only [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=14.44s)]
*  declared 30 more, instead of the full 90. And now I understand you're getting the help [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=19.7s)]
*  that you need. Why did it take them so long to do that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=24.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, Sean. Thanks for having me back on. We're still working hard to recover [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  and still got people without power now dealing with this new storm. And certainly our thoughts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=34.68s)]
*  and prayers go out to all our friends in Florida. I know that's going to be a hard hit down [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  there. We're worried about some of that too. You know, we were really a little shocked and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  disappointed when we only had 11 counties on the original federal declaration when [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=48.68s)]
*  we had asked for 90. We knew it was going to be a storm where the whole state was going [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  to be affected. And it really sent the message to a lot of counties next door to their neighbors [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=59.0s)]
*  that were just as hard hit that didn't get the declaration. It caused a lot of confusion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=64.76s)]
*  But I've spoke to the FEMA administrator and the White House and ended up talking to President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Biden's chief of staff. And they very quickly added other counties. So we're really in good [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=75.27999999999999s)]
*  shape right now and just still working to recover. And we got another storm on the way [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  unbelievably. Let me ask you this. Like Governor DeSantis [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=86.32s)]
*  and Governor McMaster, you were prepared for Hurricane Helene. You had pre-stage utility [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=90.94s)]
*  trucks and food and water and medicine and supplies. You were ready in Georgia. Everybody [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  knew this was going to be a bad hurricane. And you had prepared. The federal government [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=101.2s)]
*  did nothing. Then we hear a week after Hurricane Helene that FEMA is bankrupt. Then we learned [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=107.04s)]
*  that a billion dollars had been raided from FEMA and given to illegal immigrants. They [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=114.56s)]
*  tried to deny it, but it's on FEMA's own website. And I guess it's frustrating, especially [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=121.08s)]
*  like, for example, look how bad our friends in North Carolina have been hit in remote [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=127.38s)]
*  areas there. I mean, I talked to people on the ground. We had a town hall, kind of mini [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=132.5s)]
*  town hall with Sarah Carter last night. They still are not getting everything they need. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=137.14s)]
*  How is that possible? Well, I can't really speak to what's going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=141.4s)]
*  on in North Carolina on the ground other than just news reports I'm seeing. I know it's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=147.14s)]
*  devastated up there just like it is in Georgia. I can tell you that one of our congressmen [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=151.3s)]
*  I was talking to assures me that there's funding there for FEMA for these type things. And [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=157.22s)]
*  I know that they'll be looking into that. But Sean, I'll tell you, whether it's, you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  know, Governor DeSantis, myself, Governor McMaster, I mean, you have got to be ready when you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=167.58s)]
*  know these big storms are coming. You just can never predict this weather. These storms [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  will move on you just like they did, just like Helene did. You know, it was supposed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=178.06s)]
*  to take a left-hand turn and go up, you know, to Nashville, Tennessee. And it ended up staying [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=182.66s)]
*  really straight after it hit land and went to Augusta, Georgia on into South Carolina. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=189.3s)]
*  And we we had hardly ever have hurricane winds in Georgia on a storm. And this one was a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  cat to most of the way across the state and a cat one when it got up there around Augusta. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  And it was just a devastating storm. But I can tell you this. We had our people as soon [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=207.78s)]
*  as that storm went through in Valhasta, Georgia, and it was safe to do so. We had the National [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=212.7s)]
*  Guard. We had power company folks. We had our Forestry Commission folks. We had Department [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=218.66s)]
*  of Transportation folks and everybody and their brother going in right behind that storm [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=225.02s)]
*  to start helping. It takes you about 72 hours to just get a handle on what's going on, to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=229.78s)]
*  get roads cleared, to be able to get the people to start servicing. But you cannot [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=235.5s)]
*  wait a day or two. You got to go in as soon as it's safe to do so. And that's what we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=241.14s)]
*  did. And I know that's what Governor DeSantis is preparing for now. I talked to him just [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=245.82s)]
*  briefly yesterday, wished him the best, told him to let us know if he needed resources [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=250.98s)]
*  after the storm passed. And I know, you know, we had a very short conversation because he [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=256.1s)]
*  is all business right now getting ready. And that's what you have to do. That's what we [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=260.54s)]
*  did. We have an inflection point election, really important election, a choice election [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=264.26s)]
*  for the country and our future. I don't care about Democrat or Republican. Are any accommodations [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=270.98s)]
*  going to be made in affected states for people to vote that may be displaced? Well, we feel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=276.86s)]
*  really good about where we are right now and getting power back on, having precincts, being [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=286.26s)]
*  able to function. We got a few that they're not sure about, but we're working with the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=291.72s)]
*  elections officials in the state of Georgia to make sure that we can make accommodations, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  which we can do that, Sean, through the state of emergency. So I'll assure you we'll have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=300.8s)]
*  ability for Georgians to vote when early voting starts here in just a few days. Yeah. All [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  right. Our prayers are with you and your recovery in Georgia. Our friends down here in Florida [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=312.04s)]
*  and North Carolina obviously hit so hard and others. Governor, great to have you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCAd7wq6cA&t=317.44s)]
