# Mike Huckabee: Democrats are dealing with an ‘absolute meltdown’
**Fox News:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0)
*  On TV, the panicked chorus of media voices only grew louder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=6.4s)]
*  His performance was—I sat there and watched it, and I could not believe it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=7.4s)]
*  I said, not only is this a political hydrogen bomb for him and the Democratic Party, it—you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=14.16s)]
*  know, what happened? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=27.36s)]
*  Is Joe Biden the person who can stop Donald Trump or somebody like Trump who gets the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=30.139999999999997s)]
*  Republican nomination? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=36.1s)]
*  That's what he's got to—he's got to look in the mirror, search his soul and make [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=37.1s)]
*  that decision. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=41.54s)]
*  And I wanted to raise that question. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=42.58s)]
*  I'd like him to think that through carefully, because I have my concerns. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=43.94s)]
*  Here now with reaction, our former RNC chair, Reince Priebus, and former Arkansas governor, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=49.14s)]
*  Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=54.14s)]
*  Welcome, gentlemen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=55.14s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, you know your way around a debate stage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=56.7s)]
*  This blaming of staff for Joe Biden presenting as too old, for having the vacant look in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=60.42s)]
*  his eyes, for allowing numbers to numb his brain—I mean, he could have gotten a doctor's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=64.98s)]
*  note. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=69.82s)]
*  They're saying he had a cold. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=70.82s)]
*  I think if you take away the C, you get more of the answer here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=71.82s)]
*  But how do you see this? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=75.58s)]
*  And do you think people will forget this debate performance and start focusing on the issues [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=77.54s)]
*  or start giving Joe Biden a little bit of grace? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=82.54s)]
*  I think that there's no one to blame but Joe Biden. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=86.14s)]
*  As a person who has been on the debate stage, the truth is you can have all these people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=91.26s)]
*  talking to you and telling you what you ought to do and not ought to do, but you're the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=94.94s)]
*  one that walks out there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=98.38s)]
*  And you also have the right to look at every one of them and tell them to shut up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=100.06s)]
*  I don't want to hear any more out of you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=103.02s)]
*  And sometimes that is the best thing to do, is to tell all the people who think they know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=104.78s)]
*  what you should do to just leave you alone and let you go out there and do your thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  But they couldn't do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=114.22000000000001s)]
*  In this nonsense about he had a cold and that's why he was so raspy and he couldn't get his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=115.22000000000001s)]
*  thoughts together, every one of us know that if he'd really been sick in that eight-day [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=119.42s)]
*  sequestering up at Camp David, they would have talked about that every day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=125.4s)]
*  He's going to be there even though he's going to have to push through how sick he is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, let's just be realistic here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  There is a run on toilet paper in D.C. because of that performance last week because the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=136.10000000000002s)]
*  Democrats, well, let's just say they're having a rough week too, trying to decide [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=141.26s)]
*  how to deal with what is an absolute meltdown. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=146.74s)]
*  And we're all seeing it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=151.54s)]
*  Yes, and some of us are enjoying it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=152.54s)]
*  Couldn't happen to a nicer crew. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=154.74s)]
*  Reince Priebus, you've been the RNC chair, you're the White House chief of staff, you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=157.1s)]
*  have a big hand in this month's convention out of Milwaukee. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=160.22s)]
*  You've been in the room to prep candidates for debates, including President Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=166.86s)]
*  Now, he preps just by not having a podium or lighting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=171.5s)]
*  He preps by doing these rallies and these interviews and whatnot. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=173.9s)]
*  But I'm very curious about the blaming of staff, particularly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  Isn't that a risk that they're taking? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=180.9s)]
*  The staff knows him best. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  The staff has been covering for him and his lack of acuity and agility for a very long [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=189.02s)]
*  Well, you're right, Kelly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=190.02s)]
*  And you and I did debate prep in 2016. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=193.02s)]
*  It's ridiculous to blame the staff for this kind of performance, because, you know, he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=197.06s)]
*  came out in the first 30 seconds and everyone knew something was wrong. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=200.9s)]
*  He wasn't making any sense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=205.58s)]
*  When you do the—I mean, basic debate prep, it's not that complicated. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Number one, hey, there's a split screen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=210.38s)]
*  When the camera's not on you or you're not—excuse me, when you're not speaking, you have to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=213.06s)]
*  act like everyone's watching you because there's a split screen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Hey, you're going to get attacked on immigration, the economy and inflation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  You've got three canned answers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=224.62s)]
*  He couldn't deliver any of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=226.38s)]
*  And it's a cover-up. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  The whole thing's a cover-up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=231.18s)]
*  And by blaming staff, you just make it worse. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=232.18s)]
*  And you know, these reporters that are talking about he needs to get out, what they really [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=235.26s)]
*  need to do is find out why. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=239.9s)]
*  I think Bob Woodward, if you kept playing his interview, he said it well, which is, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=242.06s)]
*  look, this was so impossibly bad that these reporters ought to figure out why was it so [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=246.38s)]
*  bad. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=253.22s)]
*  What is the real answer? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=254.22s)]
*  What really is going on with the president of the United States? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=256.1s)]
*  If Scottie Schaeffler shot 120 yesterday, no one would be saying, well, you had a cold, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=261.18s)]
*  you had a bad day. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=266.7s)]
*  No. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=267.7s)]
*  They would be asking the question. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=268.7s)]
*  And they're not—no one is asking this question. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  What is going on with Joe Biden? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=273.5s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, we're all scratching our head. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=276.1s)]
*  We can chuckle a little bit, but the serious point is the world leaders are also watching [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=278.54s)]
*  this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=283.58s)]
*  And I like your perspective on that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=284.58s)]
*  Well, the thing is—yeah, I think you're right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=285.58s)]
*  We have to recognize the serious part is that we're not the only ones watching. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=288.74s)]
*  And we're not the only ones who have been watching. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=293.26s)]
*  President Xi's been watching, Putin's watches, Kim Jong-un watches. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=296.14s)]
*  They all look at this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=300.06s)]
*  I think the reason that they never went into Ukraine with Donald Trump as president, Hamas [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=301.26s)]
*  would never have attempted to overrun and murder and butcher Jewish civilians like they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=306.82s)]
*  did on October 7th when Donald Trump was president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=312.46s)]
*  They were scared to death of him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=315.22s)]
*  They just didn't know what he might do, but they feared what he would do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=317.1s)]
*  It's why I think we need him again, because the world, whether they respect him or they're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=321.02s)]
*  just afraid of him, I don't care. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=325.7s)]
*  I just know they behave better. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=327.38s)]
*  And we need a world like we had when Donald Trump was president, not the one we have when [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=329.18s)]
*  Joe Biden is president. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=333.38s)]
*  Yes, people know what they see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  Governor Mike Huckabee and Reince Priebus, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=337.54s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=345.18s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbC6O1Uxha0&t=349.66s)]
