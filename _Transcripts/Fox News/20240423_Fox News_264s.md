# Every student involved in antisemitic activity should be expelled: Newt Gingrich
**Fox News:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs)
*  All right, here with reaction to all of tonight's stories, former speaker of the House, Fox [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=0.0s)]
*  News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=3.98s)]
*  So I first interviewed you in a Holiday Inn in 1990. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=6.24s)]
*  If you would have told me that day, that years later, I would be talking to you about virulent [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=11.34s)]
*  anti-Semitism in the halls of Congress, on college universities, worldwide, a president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=18.78s)]
*  that would abandon Israel after the worst terror attack in their history and tell them [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=26.24s)]
*  not to respond, and if you would have told me any of these things, that we'd have the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=31.32s)]
*  weaponization of our Justice Department the way it is today, I never would have believed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=38.22s)]
*  it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I guess I was young and naive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  I didn't think it would be possible. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think because I'm a lot older than you, I remember Ronald Reagan as governor [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=49.6s)]
*  dealing with the demonstrators at Berkeley, and he was very clear about it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=57.82000000000001s)]
*  He was going to clear it out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=64.44s)]
*  He was going to stop it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=66.12s)]
*  He was going to use the National Guard. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=67.72s)]
*  He was going to do whatever it took. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=69.36s)]
*  A couple simple steps. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=71.4s)]
*  Every university should expel every student engaged in anti-Semitic activity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=73.78s)]
*  Anybody who's engaged in anti-Semitic activity who is not an American citizen should be deported [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=81.14s)]
*  immediately. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  Now, those two steps alone would bring a great deal of quiet in the next 30 to 60 hours, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  but you have to have people with guts willing to stand up for America and willing to stand [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=95.26s)]
*  up for the rule of law, and right now you don't have that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=99.78s)]
*  Most of these senior universities are headed up by people who are totally cowards, who [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  are intimidated by the thugs and the brutal people and the pro-terrorists, and in fact [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=109.68s)]
*  they need to stand up to them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  That was Reagan's great fight as governor, and it helped make him president of the United [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=121.4s)]
*  I think in terms of the court, something that Speaker Mike Johnson said really struck home [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=122.4s)]
*  when he said about the decision on whether or not to help Israel and Ukraine that this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=129.0s)]
*  is not a game. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you, I am deeply worried that tomorrow a totally corrupt judge and a totally [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  corrupt district attorney are going to try to put a former president of the United States, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=144.72s)]
*  candidate of his party and front runner in the polls, in jail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, I think this is so horrendous that there has to be some way to reach out to the Supreme [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=155.76s)]
*  Court. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is literally like some of the civil rights workers in Mississippi in the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  1960s. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  The New York system is now so deeply corrupted and it is so bitterly, deeply anti-Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  The absurdity of the judge's daughter, who made millions and millions of dollars doing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=176.56s)]
*  politics, and the judge would like us to believe, much like Joe Biden, he had no idea what his [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=182.08s)]
*  children were doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=187.36s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing, frankly, resembles on the waterfront Stanley Kubrick's growing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=188.36s)]
*  film. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=194.56s)]
*  This is about corruption. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=195.56s)]
*  It has nothing to do with honesty. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=197.56s)]
*  And what worries me is it's a genuine threat to Donald Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=200.32s)]
*  I mean, I think any step that would put him close to a New York prison is an extraordinarily [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=204.84s)]
*  dangerous step. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=211.4s)]
*  And I would hope that there's some legal way to block it and make sure that it never [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=212.82s)]
*  happens because the thugs he's dealing with are totally out of control, have total contempt [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=217.04s)]
*  for the rule of law and, frankly, are unworthy of being in the office as they hold. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=224.4s)]
*  I don't think there's anything worse than Biden stabbing Israel in the back and the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  weaponization of our justice system. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=235.52s)]
*  And we will watch tomorrow because tomorrow there will be a hearing about, quote, the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=238.36s)]
*  gag order, which I would argue is unconstitutional. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=241.84s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the world has changed a lot since 1990. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=245.4s)]
*  Not for the better. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW4TsiPqOs&t=260.52s)]
