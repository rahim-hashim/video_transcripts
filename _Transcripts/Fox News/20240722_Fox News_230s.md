# Vivek Ramaswamy: We're not running against a candidate, we are running against a machine
**Fox News:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI)
*  Let's get your take on all these events. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=0.0s)]
*  The people that seem toâ€”the people that nobody seems to care about in the Democratic [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=3.0s)]
*  Party are the voters of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=7.48s)]
*  Nobody considers what they want. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And I do find these voices of Schumer, Pelosi, Obama, Hakeem Jeffries very interesting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=13.22s)]
*  Want to get your take on it? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=20.64s)]
*  Look, I think the main message, Sean, is we are not even running against a candidate here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=22.44s)]
*  We are running against a machine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=28.2s)]
*  And that machine has crushed the will of everyday citizens in both parties. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=30.52s)]
*  That includes Democrats. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=35.22s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of Democrats who may not agree with everything that our party [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=36.6s)]
*  says or that Donald Trump says, but who are sick and tired of being lied to by their own [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=39.86s)]
*  leaders. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And our message to those Democrats is this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=47.7s)]
*  You may not agree with everything Republicans say, but at least you deserve a party and a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=48.7s)]
*  president who tells you the actual truth. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  And I think this could be a moment to win by an even larger margin by saying that, you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=55.28s)]
*  know what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=59.08s)]
*  You're welcome in a Republican Party that may not agree with you on all policies, but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=60.08s)]
*  is at least going to respect you and be honest with you, as it's now clear the Democratic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  elite has not been with their own voter base. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=67.36s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=71.04s)]
*  Now, let's talk about the fact that they're not supporting Kamala Harris, the very same [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=72.04s)]
*  people that I would argue pushed Biden out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  It says a lot to me that, you know, you have the Obamas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  We know that Barack gave the wink and the nod to George Clooney to write that New York [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  Times op-ed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=90.52s)]
*  We know he's been working hard behind the scenes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  We know that he gave the okay to Schumer and Pelosi to do the things that they've been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=94.88s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  And then all of those same voices are silent tonight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  Now, the Congressional Black Caucus, very prominent voices within the Democratic Party, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=105.78s)]
*  James Clyburn, others, they're supporting Kamala Harris, but they're the same group [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=110.7s)]
*  of people that didn't win out in this battle for Joe Biden to stay in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  So who's going to win the next battle? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=119.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=121.7s)]
*  So, look, I say this as somebody who a year ago predicted Joe was not going to be the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=122.7s)]
*  nominee. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=127.22s)]
*  I'm going to predict that Kamala Harris is not going to be the nominee either. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=128.22s)]
*  And the reason is if they get one shot, they're going to take their absolute best shot that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=131.54s)]
*  they can. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=135.82s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=136.82s)]
*  That's clearly not Kamala Harris. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=137.82s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=138.82s)]
*  I think there's a lot of open possibilities. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=140.06s)]
*  I would not write off the possibility that it ends up being Michelle Obama. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  She checks off the same identity politic boxes and it's going to be somebody who's maybe [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=145.42s)]
*  above the fray that doesn't create the same kind of infighting that could debilitate their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=149.42s)]
*  party. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=154.66s)]
*  So Barack is literally leading the charge, trying to keep his, you know, keeping plausible [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=155.66s)]
*  deniability and then his own wife takes over. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  What do you call that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=167.98s)]
*  I think it's, I think you call it realism. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=169.62s)]
*  Sean, the reality is they're going to take their best shot. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=172.46s)]
*  They waited till after the RNC convention. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  That timing is optimal for them because it gets closer and closer to the eventual election. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=177.86s)]
*  They're going to drag this out, I predict, through the Democratic nomination convention [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=182.54s)]
*  at the DNC in late August. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=186.18s)]
*  I think Michelle Obama is not off the table. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=188.22s)]
*  But you know what our message is, and I know President Trump would agree with this as well, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=190.38s)]
*  our message to the Democrats is you know what, put up the best possible ticket that you can. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=194.24s)]
*  That'll be good for your party. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=198.5s)]
*  It'll be good for the country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  And it doesn't matter because we're still going to win because our vision for this country [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=201.58s)]
*  is the stronger one for all Americans. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=205.5s)]
*  That's how we win. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=208.18s)]
*  It's not fair, of course it's not. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=209.18s)]
*  Early voting is in 56 days. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=210.18s)]
*  But the reality is, Sean, we have to defeat this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=211.18s)]
*  It's a soft coup. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=214.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=215.86s)]
*  Thank you, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=216.86s)]
*  Where else? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9iJvo4fRyI&t=228.46s)]
