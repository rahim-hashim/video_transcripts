# Sean Duffy: Kamala Harris' border trip is an 'outrageous' political move
**Fox News:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks)
*  Joining me now, Sean Duffy, co-host of FBN's The Bottom Line, and Stephen Miller, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  former senior adviser to President Trump, founder of America First Legal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=4.0s)]
*  Sean, let's start with you. Will this trip to the border, with her walking alongside the border [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=8.16s)]
*  fence earlier today, end up helping her campaign? Yes, only if she resurrects her old chant of down [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=14.72s)]
*  down with deportation, up up with education. If she does that, it might be an honest moment [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=22.0s)]
*  for Kamala Harris. But Laura, I think she won't do that tonight. Let's be clear. She is the most [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=26.96s)]
*  powerful person in the whole federal government when it comes to the border and border security. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=32.88s)]
*  And it wasn't all the drugs that are flown into this country, or the murderers, or the sex [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=37.92s)]
*  traffickers, or the 320,000 kids that were lost. None of those things, where her countrymen were [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=43.92s)]
*  dying, would bring her to the southern border. But to your point, she's down by 15 points in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=50.0s)]
*  the recent Fox polling in Arizona on immigration. So she's going to go to the border not to save [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=54.08s)]
*  her people, but to save her political skin. This is the most outrageous, disgusting political move [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=59.44s)]
*  I've ever seen. If you believe in open borders, Kamala, own it. Run on it. Let us all see the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=65.6s)]
*  policy. But don't try to rope-a-dope us into believing that you think we're going to have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=70.72s)]
*  secure borders by this stupid visit to the southern border. It's not going to work with anybody. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=74.24s)]
*  Well, Stephen, the Border Patrol Union has just destroyed Kamala on this issue. Very, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=78.72s)]
*  very critical. She addressed the Border Patrol and how important they were today. Watch. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=84.16s)]
*  They need, rightly, support to do their job. And they work long hours. They're very dedicated. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=92.64s)]
*  And so I'm here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them and to also [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=100.4s)]
*  thank them for the hard work they do. They have a hard job, Stephen. I wonder why their job's hard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=106.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris has turned the Border Patrol into a global resettlement agency. If you work today at [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=116.8s)]
*  Border Patrol, if you work today at ICE, instead of enforcing the law and deporting illegals, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=124.72s)]
*  your job is to ferry illegals all over the country, bust them, drive them, transport them, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=130.64s)]
*  and load them onto airplanes and fly them right into the American heartland. So, yes, I cannot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=136.88s)]
*  imagine anything harder, more difficult, or more demoralizing than signing up to defend America [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  and being forced by Kamala Harris to participate in its destruction. You talked about those numbers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=147.92s)]
*  that you led with today. Think about that. Think about being an ICE officer and having to release [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=153.92s)]
*  425,000 convicted criminals, 13,000 murderers, 15,000 rapists. And those are only the ones that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=159.6s)]
*  we know about. The suffering, the misery, the bloodshed that she has unleashed through her [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=170.48s)]
*  policies. As President Trump said, today it's unforgivable. Some things in life cannot be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  pardoned. This is unforgivable, Laura. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Sean, when we think about what they did to Donald Trump with that obscene impeachment in 2019, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=186.16s)]
*  because Vindman and Company decided this was their moment, what is this, what they've done? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=193.44s)]
*  They've fundamentally changed our country, harmed Americans. Their policies have ended up killing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=200.96s)]
*  Americans. How is this really not rising to the level of impeachable conduct? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=206.56s)]
*  I think there's two sets of rules, Laura. Republicans play by one set, which are the old [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=213.28s)]
*  rules, and Democrats play by the new set of rules, and they bludgeon the crap out of Republicans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=217.44s)]
*  I think, to your point, we all have to play by the same set of rules, and I think Republicans [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=222.24s)]
*  have to start playing the same game. This is an impeachable offense, no doubt. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=226.88s)]
*  I come back to what Donald Trump says on the immigration issue all the time, which is, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=232.56s)]
*  they open up their prisons. They let the worst people out of their prisons and ship them to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=238.0s)]
*  America. Well, now these numbers that we're talking about, of course that's true. And by the way, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=242.08s)]
*  who's at the southern border vetting the people that come to our border? How do you let in all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=246.4s)]
*  of these murderers and sexual predators into our country? They're not being vetted. So anyone who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=250.56s)]
*  comes to the border, in essence, they all get in. That's the policy and the plan of Kamala Harris. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=256.56s)]
*  My concern, though, is the border is working. The border issue works for Trump in Arizona. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't have the same potency in places like Georgia per the Fox polling. I think he has to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=265.92s)]
*  hit this issue harder, how it plays in every single state, as well as the economy and double [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=270.56s)]
*  team it. I agree. Women are being affected by this open border. They're victims of the crimes [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=276.96s)]
*  more than men are. Women across the country, this is coming to a town and a city near you. Sean and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=283.2s)]
*  Stephen, both of you, thank you tonight. Thanks for having me. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77XDAx5Y1Ks&t=288.32s)]
