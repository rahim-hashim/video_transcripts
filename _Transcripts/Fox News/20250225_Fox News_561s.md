# Sean Hannity: This is the most transparent White House in modern US history
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight you may want to check in on your Democratic friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=0.0s)]
*  They're not really seemingly doing very well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=5.32s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome, radical rage is on the rise and perhaps no one has it worse [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=8.0s)]
*  than our old friend or old Twitter buddy Alec Baldwin. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=13.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=17.28s)]
*  My kids live in this building, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=18.28s)]
*  But I want you to know something. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=19.28s)]
*  We love the children. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=20.72s)]
*  We're doing great deals for the children. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=21.72s)]
*  You have to be real careful. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=22.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=23.72s)]
*  If this can't go on, I'd snap your f***ing neck in half and break your f***ing neck right [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=24.72s)]
*  there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=27.72s)]
*  Don't you? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=28.72s)]
*  I mean, you can't make aâ€”my message to Alec Baldwin, that'll be coming up, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=29.72s)]
*  I do hope he takes my advice, but the odds are pretty low. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=34.48s)]
*  It is obvious why many on the left are so triggered. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=37.92s)]
*  Not only did Trump win a second term in an electoral landslide, taking all seven swing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=41.32s)]
*  states and beating Kamala Harris by millions of votes in the popular vote, but now that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=46.08s)]
*  he's president, well, the winning continues. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sick of it either. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=53.0s)]
*  House on Friday to formally sign the agreement ending this war is in everyone's best interest. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=84.52s)]
*  We don't need more people dying. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=90.96s)]
*  We don't need more buildings blown up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=92.6s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump has been on the political scene for so long and they know [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=95.06s)]
*  so little about him is actually frightening. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=99.32s)]
*  Let me give you a clue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=101.66s)]
*  For those of you in the state-run media mob that I know are watching, here's a clue. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=103.06s)]
*  And those of you on the left, he is in a perpetual, nonstop state of negotiation, and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=107.74s)]
*  he puts America first. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  Just keep those thoughts in your head so you don't bubble and fizz like alka-seltzer [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=116.22s)]
*  in water. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  And back in the Oval Office, President Trump celebrated another momentous day with a brand [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  new hat. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=126.34s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=127.34s)]
*  Look. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=128.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=129.34s)]
*  See that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=130.34s)]
*  Trump was right about everything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=131.34s)]
*  It just came in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=132.34s)]
*  Somebody's got to be in the picture. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=133.34s)]
*  I said, I think we should make some of them, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=134.94s)]
*  But we were, pretty much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=136.86s)]
*  You want one? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=138.54s)]
*  I'll pass. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=139.54s)]
*  Are you allowed to take one? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=140.54s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=141.54s)]
*  Because he'll consider it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=142.54s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=143.54s)]
*  He's sort of a stiff guy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=144.54s)]
*  I said you were like, I want to take one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=145.54s)]
*  He's sort of a stiff guy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=146.54s)]
*  He'll take other things, but not a free hat. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=147.54s)]
*  What? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=148.54s)]
*  They're going to get in trouble if they took a hat. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=149.54s)]
*  As you might have noticed, President Trump was once again surrounded by reporters, and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=150.54s)]
*  he's a very good guy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=153.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=154.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=155.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=156.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=157.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=158.54s)]
*  He's a very good guy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=159.54s)]
*  He took a hat. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  As you might have noticed, President Trump was once again surrounded by reporters. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  This is by far the most transparent, accessible White House in modern American history. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  In fact, in his first month, Trump answered more than 1,000 questions from the press, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=170.34s)]
*  from interviews to press conferences to speeches, gaggles, the behind-the-scenes videos. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  President Trump is seemingly everywhere. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=181.06s)]
*  His agenda is being felt far and wide. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=182.62s)]
*  Illegal border crossings are down almost 100 percent. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  The FBI and DOJ, which had been weaponized and politicized, is now getting dismantled. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=188.5s)]
*  Major companies, look at Apple, are now pledging $500 billion to be spent inside the U.S., [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  building a plant inside the U.S., creating tens of thousands of jobs right here in our [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=205.02s)]
*  Doge has already saved, on record, you the American people, an estimated whopping $65 [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=206.02s)]
*  billion, and that number is expected to go up dramatically. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=212.02s)]
*  Employees are officially back in the office after years of lackluster remote work. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=216.54s)]
*  Seventy-five thousand plus took a buyout offer, and America's great meritocracy is now making [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=221.58s)]
*  a comeback. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=226.78s)]
*  Even the CEO of JP Morgan is now praising Trump and Doge for taking on America's out-of-control [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=227.78s)]
*  bureaucracy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=234.1s)]
*  This is all really good news, and President Trump's approval ratings are through the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=235.46s)]
*  roof on top of it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=239.1s)]
*  But if you have a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, this is a nightmare for you, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=240.62s)]
*  you come to life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=245.7s)]
*  And now top Democrats, they just can't help themselves. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=247.14s)]
*  They lash out morning, noon and night, including the party's rising star, Congresswoman Jasmine [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Crockett. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=256.5s)]
*  Here's her from earlier today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=257.5s)]
*  If you could speak directly to Elon Musk, what would you say? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=258.5s)]
*  F*** off. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=262.3s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=263.3s)]
*  So enlightening, so productive from the party you love. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=266.06s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, that's about as measured and as eloquent as, you know, it gets across [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=268.9s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=274.3s)]
*  Inside the Capitol, Congressman Hank Johnson. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember, he's the one that famously speculated the island of Guam. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=277.58s)]
*  My capsize and tip over is now fantasizing about President Trump getting arrested by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=282.3s)]
*  U.S. Marshals. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=288.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=289.34s)]
*  If a president willfully failed or refused to comply with a court ruling, they could [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=290.34s)]
*  be held in contempt of court theoretically, but it would be up to the U.S. Marshals Service, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=298.02s)]
*  which is a part of the Justice Department, to be the enforcement arm for the federal [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  courts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=310.66s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=311.66s)]
*  Your hypothetical would have to play itself out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=314.22s)]
*  It would be the U.S. Marshals who fall under the Department of Justice, who would have [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=317.18s)]
*  to carry out the contempt order. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=323.44s)]
*  I can't help it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=326.54s)]
*  Every time I see this guy, I think of Guam is going to tip over. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=329.06s)]
*  Anyway, it's funnier and gets funnier. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=332.86s)]
*  And it also gets worse. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=335.86s)]
*  Another left-wing member of Congress is now asking this age-old question posed by Democrats [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=337.3s)]
*  for centuries. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=342.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=343.3s)]
*  We can't let them deport the millions of families across this country who have been doing the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=344.3s)]
*  work that keeps our economy going every day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=350.14s)]
*  If you look at the food that's on your table, think about who picked it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  If you look at your homes, think about who built them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=358.7s)]
*  If you look at your vulnerable elders and your kids, think about who's taking care of them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=361.94s)]
*  Well, the more things change, the more they do stay the same. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=365.94s)]
*  Once again, the Democratic Party seems to value cheap labor above all else. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=369.94s)]
*  As it turns out, this is not the Party of Compassion. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=375.14s)]
*  Instead, this is a hate-filled group of radicalized socialist statists who will say and do anything [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=378.06s)]

*  It's all about them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=385.9s)]
*  In fact, according to the Free Beacon, left-wing groups, oh, you heard all this weekend about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  all these protests going on in red districts and how they were angry and lashing out at [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=392.38s)]
*  Republican lawmakers, and they're so against the Department of Government efficiency. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=398.62s)]
*  And that's all that the mainstream media mob talked about. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  Poll after poll, however, shows just the opposite. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=407.58s)]
*  Like we showed you last night, the Harvard-Harris poll, which found 77 percent of Americans [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  support an effort to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=416.06s)]
*  At the very same time, far-left Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island, now facing scrutiny [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=419.02000000000004s)]

*  environmental organization. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  It looks like the good old boy Swamp is still alive, and well, that has to be taken care [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=431.90000000000003s)]
*  of, too. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=436.62s)]
*  Now, Democrats are much more worried about Trump and Musk following the money. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=437.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you have ideas about how to interrupt what feels like something that we have not experienced [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=443.62s)]
*  since the Civil War in terms of the threat to our republic? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=449.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, certainly the case that we understand the scale of the threat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=451.85999999999996s)]
*  That can't be doubted. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=455.62s)]
*  The CBC, which I'm a part of, definitively understands the scale of the threat. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=456.62s)]
*  Our communities have been under siege, as you pointed out, since before the Civil War. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  We need help, OK? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=465.9s)]
*  We need reinforcements. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=466.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=467.9s)]
*  And we need all of you to stand with us. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=468.9s)]
*  We simply cannot do this alone. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=470.26s)]
*  I think what President Trump is doing is essentially putting extortionist pressure on a vulnerable [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  ally that is fighting for its life. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=480.94s)]
*  You could pee on my leg, but don't tell me it's rain. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=483.22s)]
*  And Trump is raining on America. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=486.18s)]
*  It's no wonder congressional Democrats are suffering now from the lowest approval rating [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  in history. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=494.66s)]
*  Now, even Jon Stewart, so frustrated with his own party, apparently accidentally hurt [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=495.66s)]
*  himself during a fit of rage. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=500.90000000000003s)]

*  Can it be? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  The companies we subsidize with billions of dollars are allowing us the privilege to negotiate [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  the price of 10 of their drugs? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=511.42s)]
*  And 10 is all of them, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=514.62s)]
*  It would be embarrassing if it was a small drop in the bucket and that the American people [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=516.22s)]
*  didn't expect that we should negotiate for all their f***ing drugs because we've already [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=519.62s)]
*  paid for it with our subsidies! [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=524.74s)]
*  And f***ing thanks! [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=526.46s)]
*  It's fine! [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0Wj0lquwU&t=530.86s)]
