# JD Vance: This was the biggest stage of my life
**Fox News:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU)
*  Joining us now the man of the hour senator JD Vance is with us senator same in you know [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=0.0s)]
*  I it was funny when I first interviewed you at the RNC [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=4.96s)]
*  We knew each other, but we didn't know each other well [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=9.0s)]
*  And I was supposed to have you for like a 10-minute interview. I think I kept you there like 30 minutes [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  By the way, I hope you're not doing anything for the next hour [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if I can stay that long tonight and as I was watching you tonight [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=20.64s)]
*  I I felt like you really got a chance to introduce yourself to the American people and I felt it was [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=24.16s)]
*  extraordinarily effective [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Because now that I've gotten to know you that's the person that I know yeah [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=34.64s)]
*  Well look I mean I just wanted to talk about issues right I saw this is an opportunity you get 90 minutes with the American people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=38.56s)]
*  It's an unbelievable opportunity for a person who wants to be the next vice president [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=43.36s)]
*  And you should just make it as much as possible about substance and you know one of the things I tried to do Sean obviously [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=46.56s)]
*  Criticized Kamala Harris's record [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=52.0s)]
*  But also reminded the American people that Donald Trump is not the caricature that Kamala Harris and the media have made them out to be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=53.76s)]
*  But he was an incredibly effective president for four years in the Oval Office, and he actually [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=60.92s)]
*  Solved problems right I think most most Americans Democrats Republicans people in the middle [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=66.72s)]
*  They're sick of Congress being like a high-class debating society [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=71.3s)]
*  They actually want their elected leaders to do something to solve the country's problems Donald Trump did that more than any person [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=75.0s)]
*  I've you know sort of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=81.2s)]
*  Observed in my you know 40 years of being on this earth [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=82.84s)]
*  And it was such a good opportunity for me to just make that point to the American people we had low inflation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Things were going well the world was more peaceful and actually Sean it's an easier argument to make tonight [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  I hate to say it because of the incredible tragedy unfolding in Israel with what looks increasingly like it could become a broader regional [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=96.84s)]
*  Conflict like when the world is going to crap [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=103.8s)]
*  And it looks increasingly more violent you want steady proven leadership [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=107.16s)]
*  That's Donald Trump and not Kamala Harris the person who has sort of broken the entire world [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  And I just tried to make that point as much as possible man [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Just make it about substance and let the American people make up their mind one of the things is I was watching the 181 ballistic [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=119.6s)]
*  Missiles being fired from Iran into into Israel, and I'm so thankful [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  they got most of them down, but they're now really fighting a forefront war and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=130.0s)]
*  And I just know in the back of my mind that there is this radical [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=134.36s)]
*  anti-israel anti-semitic even wing within the Democratic Party that I just believe the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz don't want to alienate and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=140.52s)]
*  Unfortunately evil is evil and Iran [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah Hamas they have in their charter. They've stated over and over they want to wipe Israel off the map [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=153.52s)]
*  We hear it in the halls in Congress college campuses [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=159.24s)]
*  This is a serious their their very existence is at risk here [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  No, that's exactly right and of course not just their existence, but America's national security here [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  But if Iran becomes a regional hegemon it will have a nuclear weapon the next week [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=170.27999999999997s)]
*  That will seriously endanger the United States of America because the Iranians have shown they're clearly not rational [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  But you think about this this this happened Sean because of confused policy from American leadership [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  We ask ourselves like how did it get to the point where Iran is launching 200 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=186.48s)]
*  ICBMs at America's most important regional ally and the answer is because they don't actually know where Kamala Harris stands now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=191.56s)]
*  You talk about how they've cozied up to sort of this weird pro-hommas wing within their own party [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, they're doing that of course because of political reasons, but it shows that that confusion that comes out of that policy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  invites a lot of aggression invites a lot of bad guys doing terrible things and it also Sean motivates a lot of really stupid policy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  200 ICBMs that's not cheap. Iran has a lot of other weapons. How did they fund it to reason Sean number one? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=216.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris went to war against the American energy sector that radically increased the amount of oil revenue [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=223.6s)]
*  The Iranian regime was benefiting from number two. They unfroze a hundred billion dollars of Iranian assets [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=229.04s)]
*  They're effectively handing these guys pallets of cash [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=235.12s)]
*  The Iranians are buying weapons and real leadership would be to say we screwed up. We got something wrong [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=238.44s)]
*  Let's go in another let's do what Donald Trump did [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=244.68s)]
*  But they just can't do that because of the political blind eye to the sanctions the sanctions may absolutely [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=246.84s)]
*  They literally made Iran rich and that that allows them to fund these proxy wars. That's Hamas has below Islamic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=252.24s)]
*  jihad the Houthi rebels and now Iran directly firing into Israel and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=259.16s)]
*  What should America's response be here? Well, look, I think it's tough Sean because we don't have a president that we can actually trust [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=265.44s)]
*  I don't even know who the president of the United States is and that's one thing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  We didn't actually get into the debate that I really wanted to hammer Kamala Harris on is that for three and a half years [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=274.68s)]
*  America has been saddled with the president United States who can't do the job [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=279.92s)]
*  And the reason is because Kamala Harris lied and said he was up to the job of president and of course [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=283.36s)]
*  He wasn't and now we're in this we've got this terrible crisis in Appalachia these terrible floods a lot of people affected [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=288.72s)]
*  We've got this regional war breaking out in the Middle East and we don't have effective American leadership [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=295.88s)]
*  But I think what our response is is fundamentally [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=301.42s)]
*  This is Israel's security and they have to make the decision about how they're best gonna protect their own security and they need [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=304.0s)]
*  The support of their American allies not Joe Biden as confused as he is standing behind them effectively [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=310.44s)]
*  Promising that he's going to punish them if they dare defend their own sovereignty and their own security [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=317.06s)]
*  Israel is actually very good at this stuff [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=322.6s)]
*  It's one of the great things about Israel as an ally unlike frankly a lot of so-called American allies is they have a viable military [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  They have a viable intelligence service. They're gonna make their own decision about how to protect their sovereignty [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=330.72s)]
*  I think our role here support our friends and also get back to some common-sense foreign and economic [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=336.0s)]
*  Policies so that we can be strong enough to respond to the next national security challenge. Let me ask you [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  You kept bringing up a point that I felt was very effective in this debate and that is she's been vice president nearly four [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  And you know on day one, I'm gonna fix inflation on day one. I'm gonna fix the border and day one [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=352.66s)]
*  I'm gonna do this and that and you know and walls kept bringing up the issue of immigration [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=358.26s)]
*  You brought up the 90 some odd executive orders that they they bragged about that's right [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=362.9s)]
*  but also for three years, they said the border is secure and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=367.16s)]
*  Harris wants to decriminalize illegal immigration. Yeah for free food housing health care education [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=371.18s)]
*  sex change operations [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=376.94s)]
*  Amnesty on top of it and we have all these unvetted illegal immigrants now dozens of Americans have been murdered [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=379.1s)]
*  I had the parents of two of them on last night Rachel Moran's mom and Jocelyn on Gary [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=386.1s)]
*  Many Americans have been raped including children. Yep. We have other victims of violent crime unvetted Harris Biden illegal awful [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=391.54s)]
*  Okay, the cost is through the roof and I think America understands it [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=398.88s)]
*  But you also brought up other aspects how it impacts education and the economy and housing and the high cost housing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=404.18s)]
*  Look man, so much of our problem is actually due to Kamala Harris is open border. You take 25 million illegal aliens [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=410.86s)]
*  So take a small community [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's say you've got a school district with four or five thousand kids now [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=418.1s)]
*  All of a sudden you add a thousand kids who can't speak English through no fault of their own, of course [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=422.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=426.66s)]
*  But of course the American education system the education for our kids suffers in the process [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=426.94s)]
*  Hospital wait time so the point actually didn't get to make this evening [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=432.14s)]
*  But hospital wait times have gotten longer and longer [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=435.18s)]
*  Why because a lot of illegal aliens go to the hospital emergency room to get medical care? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=437.7s)]
*  Well, that means American citizens aren't able to be seen by a doctor quickly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=442.54s)]
*  housing is I think actually the biggest issue a major driver of housing costs is that you have [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=446.58s)]
*  Millions of foreigners who are illegally in the country who are competing with Americans for scarce homes [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=452.42s)]
*  That's supply and demand and shoots the cost of housing through the roof [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=457.28s)]
*  And so I talk about substance my goal was to talk about substance tonight because I think a lot of Americans sort of intuitively [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=460.38s)]
*  Get this country's leadership has failed it and I just try to explain as much as possible [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=465.86s)]
*  Here's why Kamala Harris has been a failure [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=471.3s)]
*  Here's why Donald Trump has been a success and here's how we're gonna clean up the mess that she created [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=474.26s)]
*  Let me let me ask one question as you were on the stage [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=478.9s)]
*  Tim Wall seemed very nervous tonight [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=482.58s)]
*  Now I kind of walked away with the impression I guess maybe I felt maybe this is the reason he doesn't do interviews [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  He seemed with did it come across as nervous to you. Honestly. I didn't notice a man adrenaline's going so much [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=492.58s)]
*  I was nervous. Help me hell like I do a lot of these interviews but I was nervous [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=498.32s)]
*  It's the biggest stage of my life. So I didn't focus so much on his demeanor [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=502.16s)]
*  I just tried to focus on what he was saying and but he did to be fair to Tim Walz [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=506.26s)]
*  He had a very tough job and that is to defend the policies of Kamala Harris [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=510.38s)]
*  Bring that up. Yeah, which he did have a tough job [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=515.38s)]
*  He does and look it's Kamala Harris has done this her policy failures have made food housing energy unaffordable [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=517.74s)]
*  We just need a change in this country. We need to get back to the common-sense leadership to Donald Trump [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=525.74s)]
*  I'm not surprised that Tim couldn't defend that record who could if you put me on that debate stage [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=530.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean you clearly think I did a good job [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=534.98s)]
*  I hope that I did a good job [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=536.34s)]
*  But if you asked me to defend Kamala Harris's record I'd meld into a puddle because there is no defending what she's done the last [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  Three-and-a-half years. Let's talk about the number one issue and just about every poll for most Americans is the economy [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=543.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we have record high inflation when Donald Trump left office was 1.4 percent [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=549.3s)]
*  It's up 20 plus percent higher. That's right [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=554.26s)]
*  Everybody knows because I go shopping every week myself every store we go to every item we buy cost more [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=557.22s)]
*  If you want to buy a house [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=564.22s)]
*  Maybe if you want to change homes [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=566.26s)]
*  You're not gonna give up your 2.9 or 3 or 3 and a half or 4 percent mortgage for a 7% 30 year fixed rate mortgage [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=568.14s)]
*  Yeah, this this is these are the bread-and-butter issues of peace and prosperity [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=575.06s)]
*  Drive elections. Well, we got war in Europe war in the Middle East and we've got an economy that is struggling and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=579.86s)]
*  Wide open borders that has made our country not safe. Yeah, that's exactly right Sean [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=587.18s)]
*  I mean look, you know, I grew up in a working-class family [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=591.54s)]
*  sometimes we did okay, sometimes times were really tough and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=594.26s)]
*  I can't help but think about this through the eyes of a family that's struggling to make ends meet [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=597.86s)]
*  Where people are sort of looking at the credit card bills, they're looking at the groceries [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=603.14s)]
*  They're looking at the medical expenses and they're saying we can maybe afford two of these three things [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=606.98s)]
*  But we can't afford all three and I just want Americans [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=611.46s)]
*  I want you know if you're struggling in this country and you're looking to the future [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  I want you to look to the future from a place of hope and optimism [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=619.7s)]
*  I want you to believe the American dream is still possible because I really do believe it's still possible Sean the man [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  Only if we get the policies that actually makes sense for the American people [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=629.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I you know the thing that I've learned most that the last eight weeks man [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=634.3s)]
*  I've had such an insight into this country and it's so [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=638.42s)]
*  Amazing people come up and ask me how I'm doing and sometimes I'm talking about people who are struggling in a very big way [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's sort of like, you know [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=648.78s)]
*  I kind of have this like Eureka moment of if all of these American citizens are so concerned about the guy running for vice [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=650.42s)]
*  President when they themselves can't afford groceries. There is a generosity of spirit in this country that is so amazing [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=657.3s)]
*  We need a leader who actually matches up with that generosity of spirit a leader who's fit to lead the greatest nation in the world [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=663.34s)]
*  We don't have it now. I think we're about to have it starting on November 5th [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=670.66s)]
*  You know it was interesting because I remember Kamala had said about the high price of energy now [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=674.14s)]
*  I would think it matters to the people of Pennsylvania and your state of Ohio on the issue of fracking [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=678.58s)]
*  And she doesn't want offshore drilling [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=685.5s)]
*  One of the things that I feel with 35 days left in early voting starting [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=687.82s)]
*  She has not answered why she co-sponsored the Green New Deal 93 trillion dollars, right? That to me is Marxism [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=692.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, why she co-sponsored? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  Government-run health care Medicare for all no private health insurance, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=701.22s)]
*  You know her how do you how do you justify sex change operations paid for by taxpayers? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=705.42s)]
*  Amnesty when people don't respect our laws border sovereignty or defund dismantle the police or I did wish you brought this up at the end [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=711.62s)]
*  You know she was she tweeted out a bail fund four days after police precinct was burned to the ground [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=719.54s)]
*  Yeah, and then said they're not gonna stop rioting shouldn't stop writing. We're not gonna stop writing in my defense [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=725.4599999999999s)]
*  There's so much to whack Kamala Harris about with her record that there you only had 90 minutes [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=731.26s)]
*  I didn't have four hours. Yeah [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=735.82s)]
*  You're absolutely right here that her policies [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not just that she did these things she in some cases went out and bragged about opening the board [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=740.98s)]
*  She bragged about how she wanted to divert resources away from police officers [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=746.86s)]
*  She bragged about the Green New scam, which of course is one of the main drivers of energy and food prices [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=750.6600000000001s)]
*  She bragged about this stuff. It happened in Americans have suffered from it. Now you you made a good point [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=756.1800000000001s)]
*  She hasn't answered for any of this well Sean in her defense [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=760.54s)]
*  She has an answer for anything because she refuses to sit down for interviews press conferences or interviews [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=763.54s)]
*  Look honestly, I will offer Kamala and Tim walls a whole week's worth of shows. Yeah, they come no John [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=770.02s)]
*  I legitimately believe no kidding that you would be a much more fair interviewer of Kamala Harris than for example [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=776.78s)]
*  What Dana bash was with me, but you go on Dana basha show you go on Sean hand [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=783.46s)]
*  You go wherever you can because if you want to be the vice president of the United States [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=788.5799999999999s)]
*  You ought to earn it [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=792.88s)]
*  You ought to get out there and talk to the American people and I think it's the most scandalous part of her of her entire [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=793.9399999999999s)]
*  Campaign is that she's running from a basement [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=798.98s)]
*  Hiding from the very people that she wants to lead while you have a contrast of Donald Trump and not only was a successful [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=802.3399999999999s)]
*  President once but is so eager to get out there and make his case to the American people that he's doing multiple rallies a day [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=808.0999999999999s)]
*  Multiple interviews with with news leaders that is the kind of guy with the energy that you need to actually run this country [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  No, one of the things I think you look for in a debate is tone pitch cadence intelligence [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=821.56s)]
*  Does that person have the ability to step in God forbid if you have to become the president of the United States? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=827.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, I felt this was maybe for people that had a caricature of you mentioned one of Donald Trump [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  I think that came across tonight. You had a good time. I love fun, man [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=839.54s)]
*  Yeah, on a scale of one to ten. How nervous were you like an 11? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=844.32s)]
*  There's only you know, it's 70 million people are so watching exactly it's a it's a very big moment [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=849.84s)]
*  And yeah [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=854.44s)]
*  I just I saw it as an opportunity to look directly at the American people and communicate the ways in which I thought [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=855.12s)]
*  We could do it out, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=861.38s)]
*  There was one person ahead of you if I'm not mistaken. No, there were a lot of people ahead of me including my wife [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=862.96s)]
*  I think she was number one. Yeah, he was number one. He was way ahead of me. Yeah, but no man [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  It's such a cool opportunity to get to talk to the American people [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  To get to make your case to them to get the remind them like Kamala Harris's policies have been a failure [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=876.52s)]
*  And I tried as much as possible to make it about policy because I think that's where Donald Trump is such a better [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=881.24s)]
*  Candidate, but most importantly a much better president than these guys [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=888.64s)]
*  Record low unemployment for every demographic African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and take home pay [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=893.48s)]
*  biggest and most significant acceleration [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=901.8s)]
*  In 40 years in this country, I mean you go back [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=904.0s)]
*  There's a chart Sean that I was obsessed with in college [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=906.28s)]
*  Where you look at the wages of working-class people black brown white whatever their skin color and it basically kind of stagnates for like 30 [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=908.84s)]
*  years now and then all of a sudden this thing happens where it shoots right up and that's the presidency of Donald J [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=916.42s)]
*  Trump it's an amazing record to run on and not only were there wages of all these working people of every skin color going up [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=922.16s)]
*  But then inflation was between one and a half and two percent the entire time that he was president [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=928.78s)]
*  It's the best economic record of any president at least since World War two and man. It's not just like look [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=934.02s)]
*  Yeah, I love I'm running with a guy. I love to brag on Donald Trump's economic record [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=940.74s)]
*  People were happier and healthier families like mine could afford the essentials because he was a good president [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=944.74s)]
*  We've got to get back to it, you know last question and I now read the book and watch the movie [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=951.3199999999999s)]

*  I only had watched the movie and when you think of where you came from and I thought you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=960.6s)]
*  My four grandparents came from Ireland legally and they were poor my parents both grew up very poor and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=966.4399999999999s)]

*  That is what the presidency of Donald Trump represents. It's not just about red team versus blue team like yeah [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczPBge3zcU&t=1050.48s)]
