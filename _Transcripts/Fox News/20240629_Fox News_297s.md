# Tomi Lahren: Gavin Newsom is being a good soldier for Biden
**Fox News:** [June 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc)
*  And the host of Tommy Lahren is fearless on outkick Tommy Lahren, former Bill Clinton [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=0.0s)]
*  adviser, pollster Mark Pan, who I'm going to be really nice to tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=5.04s)]
*  I just made myself a promise before you came on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=9.28s)]
*  Tommy, I do have to start with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=13.0s)]
*  I got to tip my hat to you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=16.96s)]
*  I mean, you have been the most steadfast of anybody, saying he's going to be replaced [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=18.44s)]
*  and it's going to be Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=24.28s)]
*  You've not backed off that position. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I would assume after last night you're more locked in than ever. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=28.68s)]
*  More locked in than ever. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=35.08s)]
*  And I'd also like to say when you hear Governor Gavin Newsom say things like, I've got Joe's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=36.64s)]
*  back, notice he's not saying I will not replace him anymore. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=42.56s)]
*  I will not take the nomination. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=47.8s)]
*  He's not saying those definitive words. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=50.2s)]
*  He's saying I will have his back. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=52.32s)]
*  So, Sean, again, this sends me a lot of signals that Gavin Newsom is being a good little [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=54.92s)]
*  soldier for Joe Biden. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=60.04s)]
*  He's his number one surrogate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=61.44s)]
*  He's out there following him around, cleaning up his mess, eating up his crumbs like a vulture. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=63.12s)]
*  So when the time comes that they convince Joe Biden to step down or convince Jill Biden, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=68.76s)]
*  rather, then Gavin Newsom is going to be the one waiting there in the wings. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=73.28s)]
*  I hear a lot of people float other names. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=76.56s)]
*  I don't hear anybody floating Kamala Harris, by the way, but that's a different topic. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=78.4s)]
*  You hear Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=81.88s)]
*  You hear maybe some other promising Democrats. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=83.0s)]
*  But those other Democrats have not put in the work. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=86.52s)]
*  They have not gone on a red state tour. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=88.84s)]
*  They have not gone to Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=90.68s)]
*  They have not courted foreign leaders and Chinese presidents. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=92.08s)]
*  They have not put in the work that Gavin Newsom has put in on behalf of himself, but on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=95.16s)]
*  behalf of Joe Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=99.8s)]
*  So I am more steadfast than ever that Gavin Newsom will replace Joe Biden by the time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=100.92s)]
*  we hit November. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=106.28s)]
*  He does have a record that he's going to have to run on, and that California record [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  is pretty radical left, more radical than Joe Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=112.56s)]
*  That will be a big issue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=116.96s)]
*  You know, I'm sure there are going to be meetings, Mark, that none of us will know [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=119.88s)]
*  about, private meetings with Joe. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=123.84s)]
*  And I'm sure Joe and Jill Biden will be people will be pleading with them for the good [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=126.72s)]
*  of the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=132.92s)]
*  I think it's important that you step aside. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=134.04s)]
*  You've served the country well, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=136.4s)]
*  I'm not convinced that the Biden's are going anywhere. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=139.92s)]
*  With that said, I want to know what you think. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=143.64s)]
*  And if he was to be replaced, how do you get past Kamala Harris to Tommy's selection [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=147.2s)]
*  of Gavin Newsom? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=153.92s)]
*  Well, I think I've been equally steadfast on the other side of this, saying that Joe [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=157.72s)]
*  Biden is the nominee. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=163.68s)]
*  He was elected by the Democratic voters in the primaries. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=165.32s)]
*  He's not going anywhere. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=169.0s)]
*  I will say that last night's debate creates some potential turbulence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=170.96s)]
*  I think the Democrats are going to see what happens with the polls. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=177.52s)]
*  I think people in Congress are going to be worried. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, but I don't think that there's really going to be a change. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=185.24s)]
*  I think that things are going to consolidate back around Biden in advance of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=188.88s)]
*  convention. And they figure, look, we'll pull this thing back together in the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=193.32s)]
*  convention. But there will be some turbulence here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=196.68s)]
*  As well, we're in the middle of the turbulence. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=200.72s)]
*  Probably it's a good thing for him that we're heading into the Fourth of July [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=203.04s)]
*  weekend. But I assume these conversations will take place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=206.92s)]
*  If you were to put out odds, Mark, what would you say the odds are that he's the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=212.76s)]
*  candidate come November? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=217.4s)]
*  Oh, I still think it's kind of eight or nine and ten that he's the candidate, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=219.44s)]
*  because it really takes a lot to unseat a sitting president who has control of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=225.56s)]
*  party and wants to run. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=230.4s)]
*  And as you saw, he got out there today. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=232.48s)]
*  He wants to run. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=235.0s)]
*  You know, in politics, when you give up your seat, you're done. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=236.4s)]
*  And people do not want to give up that seat and those planes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=239.76s)]
*  Tommy, what are the what are the odds you're correct? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=243.8s)]
*  I'm sticking with my original thought. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=246.56s)]
*  I don't think Joe Biden's going to have a choice at this point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=248.72s)]
*  And Joe Biden's not either. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=251.08s)]
*  They're not going to go and continue to be embarrassed like this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  They're egomaniacs, so they're not going to let their legacy come down to this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=255.08s)]
*  Joe might not even be able to stand by September. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=258.92s)]
*  Let's just be honest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=261.12s)]
*  All right. Well, one of you are right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=263.48s)]
*  Just don't know which one yet. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=266.44s)]
*  We'll find out. We're going to watch it unfold. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=267.68s)]
*  We only have one hundred and twenty nine days. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=270.12s)]
*  So we're going to have to wait and see. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=272.32s)]
*  We only have one hundred and twenty nine days till Election Day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=274.52s)]
*  And if they try a dirty trick, I don't think it's going to go over well [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=277.76s)]
*  with the American people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=281.08s)]
*  They try and jump over Kamala Harris. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  They got a problem. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0ylp7cqjc&t=284.35999999999996s)]
