# Elon Musk: We’re watching the ‘thrashing’ of bureaucracy
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds)
*  Welcome back to Hannity and we are back at the White House and here is part two of my [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=0.0s)]
*  exclusive interview with President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=5.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=8.76s)]
*  This is the million dollar or billion dollar, among billionaires question. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=9.76s)]
*  So you have all this going on and you stop in a way. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  You're still doing it and you partner with him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=20.72s)]
*  And this is what you get for it from the Democrats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=25.82s)]
*  Nobody voted for Elon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=29.28s)]
*  Well nobody voted for any of your cabinet nominees. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=30.8s)]
*  People are dying because of Doge cuts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=33.96s)]
*  I'll give you a chance to respond to all of that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=37.08s)]
*  What Doge is doing is illegal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=39.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is more street vernacular for a male body part. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  It's a constitutional crisis. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=46.2s)]
*  Why are they reacting like this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=48.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, do you give it a flying rip, number one? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=51.72s)]
*  Well, I guess we must be over the target or doing something right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=56.92s)]
*  You know, like they wouldn't be complaining so much if we weren't doing something useful, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  I think. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=63.96s)]
*  What we're really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  And what we're finding is that there's an unelected bureaucracy, speaking of unelected, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=73.28s)]
*  there's a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the president and the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=77.44s)]
*  cabinet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=84.8s)]
*  And you look at, say, at DC voting, it's 92% Kamala. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=86.72s)]
*  Okay, so we're in 92% Kamala. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=92.24s)]
*  They don't like me here either. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=94.2s)]
*  I think about that number a lot. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=95.28s)]
*  Like 92%. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=96.64s)]
*  That's basically almost everyone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=97.96s)]
*  And so, but if, but how can you, if the will of the president is not implemented and the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=100.56s)]
*  president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=111.52s)]
*  implemented and that means we don't live in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=114.88s)]
*  And so I think what we're seeing here is the sort of thrashing of the bureaucracy as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=119.84s)]
*  we try to restore democracy and the will of the people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Is this making sense? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=129.84s)]
*  I mean, so. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=130.84s)]
*  No, of course it does. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=131.84s)]
*  I mean, to me, if you look at our framers and our founders and you really become a student [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=132.84s)]
*  of history, Mr. President, and we've had conversations both on air and off air, and if we talk about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=139.72s)]
*  constitutional order or transformational change, nobody can argue that what's happening here [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=146.72s)]
*  is going at the speed of light. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  But however, what were the principles of our framers and our founders? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=153.24s)]
*  They wanted limited government, greater freedom for the people, and we'll get to the specific [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  cutting of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=163.0s)]
*  That is your goal, is it not? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and my goal was to get great people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something I knew him a little [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=169.56s)]
*  bit through the White House. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Originally, I'd see him around a little bit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  I didn't know him before that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=178.52s)]
*  And I respected what he did. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=180.56s)]
*  And he fought hard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=181.88s)]
*  You know, he was maybe questioned for a while. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=182.88s)]
*  He was having some difficulties. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=187.44s)]
*  It was not easy doing what he did. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=191.08s)]
*  made a better car where it's beating these big companies that that's all they do is cars? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=194.6s)]
*  I mean, it's really amazing the things he's done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=199.84s)]
*  But I didn't know it as much then as now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=202.4s)]
*  I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=205.6s)]
*  But I wanted great people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=209.52s)]
*  And he's a great person. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=212.4s)]
*  He's an amazing person. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=213.8s)]
*  He's also a caring person. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=215.0s)]
*  You know, he uses the word care. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=216.0s)]
*  So they signed a contract in a government agency, and it has three months. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  And the guy leaves that signed the contract and nobody else is there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=223.28s)]
*  And they pay the contract for 10 years. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  So the guy is getting checks for years and years and years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  And he's telling his family, obviously, maybe it was crooked, maybe paid to get the contract [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  or maybe paid that they didn't terminate it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=236.68s)]
*  But you know, we have contracts that go forever. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  And they've been going for years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're supposed to end in three months or five months or two years or something. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=243.88s)]
*  And they go forever. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=247.28s)]
*  So the guy is either crooked, you know, where he knew this was going to happen, or he's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=248.74s)]
*  crooked because he's getting payments that he knows he shouldn't be getting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=252.16s)]
*  But they're finding things like that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=255.72s)]
*  They're finding things far worse than that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=257.12s)]
*  And they're finding billions and will be hundreds of billions of dollars worth of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=259.38s)]
*  fraud. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=265.04s)]
*  I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=266.52s)]
*  And he's doing an amazing job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=271.18s)]
*  And he attracts a young, very smart type of person. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  I call them high IQ individuals. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=278.44s)]
*  And they are. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  They're very high IQ and high IQ. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people, you know, the people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  think they're going to pull it over. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  They don't. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  These guys are smart. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  And they love the country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, there's a certain something. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  But he uses the word care. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=293.64s)]
*  So people have to care. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=295.78s)]
*  Like when I bought Air Force One, I negotiated the price. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=298.12s)]
*  It was $5.7 billion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=302.12s)]
*  And I got it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  I got them down $1.7 billion. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  Now, they're not building the plane fast enough. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=306.58s)]
*  I mean, they're actually in default. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=308.82s)]
*  Boeing, they're supposed to have been building this thing forever. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=310.98s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=313.98s)]
*  We don't build the way we used to build. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=316.18s)]
*  We used to build like a ship a day. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=318.26s)]
*  And now to build a ship is like a big deal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=319.9s)]
*  And we're going to get this country back on track. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=323.24s)]
*  We can do it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=325.24s)]
*  But so many things. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=326.58s)]
*  It takes so long to get things built and get things done. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=328.02s)]
*  And a lot of it could be something we've been discussing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=331.46s)]
*  The regulators go in and they make it impossible to build. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=333.7s)]
*  They make it very difficult to build anything, whether it's a ship, a plane or a building [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=336.82s)]
*  or anything. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=340.42s)]
*  And some of them do it because they want to show how important they are. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  Some of them do it maybe because they think they're right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=345.96s)]
*  They use the environment to stop progress and to stop things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=349.62s)]
*  It's always the environment. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=353.38s)]
*  It's an environmental problem. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=354.58s)]
*  It's not an environmental problem at all. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=355.74s)]
*  But they do a lot of things. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=358.06s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, Lee Zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=359.06s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=362.26s)]

*  It is not fixing the system itself. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=416.2s)]

*  I'm going to, just for the sake of saving time, because I could spend—and I've done [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=523.42s)]
*  on radio and TV. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=530.38s)]
*  I can spend an hour finding the outrageous amounts of money being spent abroad like USAID. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=531.38s)]
*  And I just want to mention a couple, but I'm going to scroll it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=537.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess at a high level, I think it's what the president mentioned earlier, which [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=541.5400000000001s)]
*  is that in order to save taxpayer money, it comes down to two things, competence and caring. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=545.98s)]
*  When the president was shown the outrageous bill for the new Air Force One and then negotiated [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=554.3s)]
*  it down, if the president had not applied competence and caring, the price would have [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=561.02s)]
*  been 50 percent higher. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=567.06s)]
*  Literally, 50 percent higher. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=569.14s)]
*  The president cared. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=571.2199999999999s)]
*  The president was competent. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  The price was not 50 percent higher as a result. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=574.8599999999999s)]
*  And so when you add more competence and caring, you get a better deal for the American people. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=577.66s)]
*  But we could take—we were talking about this yesterday. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=582.34s)]
*  I could take—give me thousands of bills. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=584.34s)]
*  I could pick any one of them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=588.0600000000001s)]

*  And let's say it's a bill for $5,000, just $5,000, and it's done by some bureaucrat. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=590.7s)]
*  And if he would say, I'll give you three, I don't want to pay you five, it's too [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  high, I'll give you three. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=601.86s)]

*  This is true with lawyers, legal fees. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=613.98s)]

*  But you offer people a much lower number because, you know, they actually put—I'm not even [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=625.5400000000001s)]

*  They put more on because they expect to be negotiated. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=634.0600000000001s)]
*  When you send in a bill to the government, there's nobody to negotiate. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=637.22s)]
*  If you send in a bill for $10,000, then they send you a check back for $10,000. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=641.38s)]
*  If you would call them and say, we'll give you five. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpcLT8-Eds&t=644.58s)]
