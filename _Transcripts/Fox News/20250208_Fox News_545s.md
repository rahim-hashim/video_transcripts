# How Riley Gaines inspired Jillian Michaels to 'reject absurdity'
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ)
*  All right, every educational institution in the country now has a choice to make. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  They can either block biological men from playing in women's sports, or they can say [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=7.08s)]
*  goodbye to federal funding for the foreseeable future. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=10.88s)]
*  Well, that's thanks to a new executive order signed today at the White House by President [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=13.92s)]
*  Trump, fulfilling a major campaign promise to keep men out of women's sports in America. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  And Trump announced today that promise includes the upcoming Olympics in Los Angeles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=23.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=28.62s)]
*  With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=29.8s)]
*  With my action this afternoon, we're putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  notice that if you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=42.0s)]
*  you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  There will be no federal funding. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  In Los Angeles in 2028, my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=56.74s)]
*  batter female athletes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=62.86s)]
*  And we're just not going to let it happen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=64.86s)]
*  And it's going to end. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=66.58s)]
*  And it's ending right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=67.58s)]
*  And nobody's going to be able to do a damn thing about it, because when I speak, we speak [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=69.26s)]
*  with authority. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  Now Trump's executive order was cheered by people who have actually played women's sports [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  and denounced by only those that pretend to care about female athletes, including ESPN, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=80.9s)]
*  which I was pretty shocked, said in a post on X that Trump's order was, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=86.34s)]
*  designed to prevent people who were biologically assigned male at birth from participating [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=90.42s)]
*  in women's or girls' sporting events. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=96.14s)]
*  People who are biologically assigned male at birth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=99.78s)]
*  Isn't that men? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=103.34s)]
*  Anyway, here with more podcast host Jillian Michaels and the host of the Gains for Girls [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=104.94s)]
*  podcast on the Outkick Network, Riley Gaines. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=110.7s)]
*  Riley, you live this life. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=113.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, think back, you would have, you know, won that race. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=114.5s)]
*  You had to deal with, you know, a naked male in the locker room. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=118.62s)]
*  I'm sure that was a little awkward for a lot of the girls on the team, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, not even just awkward, of course. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  That is one of the most violating experiences you could possibly imagine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=129.68s)]
*  I'm not diminishing it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=133.7s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=134.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=135.7s)]
*  No, no, absolutely. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=136.7s)]
*  I would never, I would never allow my daughter to do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=137.7s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=141.26s)]
*  Well, that's because you're a good dad and you sound like my father. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=143.1s)]
*  But to see President Trump's decisive action today, as you said, it was a campaign promise [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  of his, issue number 17 on his platform. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=150.26s)]
*  No men and women's sports. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=153.22s)]
*  So to see him deliver in the way that he did, that visual that you saw, him signing this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=154.62s)]
*  executive order with, I mean, dozens of young girls surrounding him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=159.64s)]
*  I mean, I can't even tell you what that visual means to me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=163.62s)]
*  Someone who, of course, I mean, three years, it doesn't sound like a long time, especially [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=167.42s)]
*  for those who I feel indebted to, who fought long before me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=170.94s)]
*  But man, I just feel vindicated and I feel this overwhelming feeling of gratitude every [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  day since January 20th. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=180.5s)]
*  I have been just overwhelmed by God's mercy that we certainly do not deserve. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=182.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=187.5s)]
*  I mean, it was cool to see in the Oval Office. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=188.5s)]
*  That was great. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=190.74s)]
*  You know, Jillian, you come at this from a different angle. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=191.74s)]
*  California, you'd said to Sage Steele, California got too crazy for me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=194.34s)]
*  I grew up here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=198.26s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=199.26s)]
*  My mom's a Jew. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=200.62s)]
*  My dad's an Arab. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=201.62s)]
*  I have a black kid. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=202.62s)]
*  And believe it or not, my son is half Latin, even though he doesn't look like it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=203.62s)]
*  You said, I hold a million cards in your game of woke victimology poker. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=208.26s)]
*  And when I leave California, maybe you lost your effing mind. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=213.98s)]
*  I wish I was that articulate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  I will concede I cannot come up with a line that good. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=220.42s)]
*  Oh, I appreciate it, Sean. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=224.14s)]
*  If I could just take a quick moment, I have never met Riley in person. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=228.5s)]
*  I regret that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=232.54s)]
*  I am so excited to meet you, at least in this capacity tonight, and to say how much I have [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=233.82s)]
*  admired your strength and your courage. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=239.22s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=241.98s)]
*  And a thank you on behalf of my daughter and women across the country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=243.34s)]
*  If I was to speak to now my position on this, I would say it's straight science. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=248.34s)]
*  I owned a sports medicine facility before being plucked to become a TV trainer. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=254.34s)]
*  And I have reviewed 19 different studies that looked at the ways biological males who have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=259.26s)]
*  transitions so they're on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and they still retain [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=265.86s)]
*  significant physical advantages in pretty much every aspect of athleticism across the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=271.62s)]
*  board, even against transgender males, meaning women who are on puberty blockers and cross-sex [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=278.82s)]
*  hormones. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=285.5s)]
*  And in strength alone, they have a 17% advantage, even while being on the hormones and the blockers. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=286.5s)]
*  You know, Riley, you know, as I saw you there today, I felt I was happy for you, because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=293.98s)]
*  you went out there and you went out there publicly and you took a lot of heat and you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=299.18s)]
*  went to college campuses and the lunatics were ranting and raving, as they always do, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  and you still, you kept going, you kept showing up, you kept fighting, you never stopped. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=308.82s)]
*  And why did you feel that strongly? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=313.26s)]
*  Why was it, why did you feel that, you know, God, God created you to take on that fight? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think a couple reasons. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=321.38s)]
*  You mentioned God, but personally, that is a big part of why I do what I do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=324.26s)]
*  Yes, of course, we are fighting for objective truth, biological reality, but as a Christian [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  myself, knowing that we're fighting for biblical truth, it goes back to the first book, he [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=333.22s)]
*  created the male and female. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  That's all the reassurance that I need. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=338.38s)]
*  And of course, having a younger sister myself, you know, one day hoping to have, I can only [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=340.18s)]
*  hope to have a daughter of my own. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=344.74s)]
*  How in the world could I look at myself in the mirror when going through what I went [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=347.16s)]
*  through, experiencing what I did and not fighting for my younger sister? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=351.66s)]
*  So that's a large part of why I do what I do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=356.82000000000005s)]
*  And again, that visual today, that is it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=359.5s)]
*  That is why I fight the fight and not just me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=363.06s)]
*  I think I speak for a lot when I say it's really about the next generation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=365.26s)]
*  Well, you know, I think God created Jillian so that Jillian could push me further and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=368.26s)]
*  further and further away from McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken and nicotine and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=373.54s)]
*  all the things that I love in the world. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=379.02s)]
*  That's, you know, she always is in a very nice way, giving me the best advice. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=381.18s)]
*  And I'm getting better. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  Riley, I'm sorry you're getting dragged into this, Riley. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not fair to you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=390.3s)]
*  This is a personal fight and now you're in the middle of it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=391.9s)]
*  It's not a fight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  I apologize for that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  It's not a fight. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  It's absolutely a fight, Sean. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  It's a fight to be in the middle of. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  It's absolutely a fight. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  I've got to say this publicly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  Jillian sent me grass- [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=404.26s)]
*  Riley, do you eat McDonald's? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  What would you like to say to Sean about that, Riley? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=406.73999999999995s)]
*  Grass-fed organic beef. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=410.38s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  I had a steak this weekend and it was awesome. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=413.78s)]
*  It was great. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  You win. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  There we go. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=420.06s)]
*  She's an elite athlete, Sean. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=421.22s)]
*  I want something. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=422.22s)]
*  In the whole MAHA movement. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=423.22s)]
*  Of course she does. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=424.22s)]
*  Of course she does. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=426.22s)]
*  Which I will say that is one of the greatest collabs to come out of President Trump's campaign. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=427.62s)]
*  The whole MAHA MAGA collab that we've seen, it mobilized a lot of moderates. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=432.82s)]
*  Similarly to how the issue of allowing men into women's sports did. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=438.3s)]
*  A lot of moms, right, right, they see what is happening to their children, whether it's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  what's in their kids' food or how their kids are being targeted by these large institutions [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=445.66s)]
*  in the way that they have in regards to education or what have you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=451.82000000000005s)]
*  And these mad mama bears, they turned out. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=456.18s)]
*  They turned out for President Trump for his America First agenda and to reject absurdity. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  And that is what the Democratic Party has become. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=462.62s)]
*  We'll give you the last word, Jillian. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=464.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think both of you played a very big role in this in different ways. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Jillian, you know, coming from California and saying goodbye to California in such a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=471.14s)]
*  powerful way, I think, sent a loud message that it's okay to think differently. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=475.74s)]
*  And obviously the work that Riley did, you know, played a pivotal part in this as well. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=480.46s)]
*  Honestly, Riley is spot on. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=487.86s)]
*  It's issues like this that are just so absolutely and completely unhinged and defy logic, dragging [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=491.46s)]
*  me into this fight. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=500.1s)]
*  I was inspired by her and Sage Steel on this issue, and I wanted to support them with the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=501.22s)]
*  science as best as I could. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=507.54s)]
*  And hopefully victories like this will continue to flow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=510.1s)]
*  And I just say again, Riley, congratulations. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=513.62s)]
*  Thank you for all you do. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  And Sean, I'm proud of you, buddy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=518.38s)]
*  I'm proud. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's keep it going. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  We're on a streak. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Jillian. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm 50-50 on the other issue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm making a lot of progress, but I'm not going to get into it now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=526.98s)]
*  I don't need all the hate mail. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=530.7800000000001s)]
*  Anyway, thank you both. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=532.7800000000001s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3SSNKLKCgQ&t=534.7800000000001s)]
