# Newt Gingrich: Democrats are watching this 'with terror'
**Fox News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4)
*  Fox News contributor, former House speaker Newt Gingrich is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, great to—great to see you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=3.56s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  You're the great historian. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  First, can you explain why would the Democrats double down on hundreds—tens and tens of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=9.76s)]
*  billions—it'll be hundreds of billions by the time it's over—of reckless spending [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=19.48s)]
*  on the Green New Deal, woke policies, DEI practices, transgenderism internationally, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=24.44s)]
*  taking that money from the American people, double down on men playing women's sports [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=32.32s)]
*  and double down on protecting people in this country illegally, many of them hardened criminals? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=36.8s)]
*  Why is that their strategy? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, when I watched the video you showed, I concluded that it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  was a real commentary on the decay of American education, that you had all these so-called [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=52.88s)]
*  leaders who are utterly, totally incapable of speaking in an understandable way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=59.2s)]
*  I mean, going around yelling curse words if you're an elected member of Congress is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=66.16s)]
*  just stupid, and it tells you how much our education system has decayed, that this is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=70.72s)]
*  the best the Democrats can produce. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=76.56s)]
*  Second, there are two different things going on here with the Democrats. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=79.76s)]
*  The first is they are watching with terror as all the different sources of government [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=84.16s)]
*  money that has propped them up for the last 60 or 70 years, all of it is now being challenged [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=90.08s)]
*  by President Trump and by Elon Musk. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=96.28s)]
*  I mean, this cuts at the very base of their coalition. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=98.16s)]
*  And if they can't bribe people, if they can't act corruptly, if they can't take [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  care of their friends, their entire coalition is going to collapse. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=106.04s)]
*  Second, you have a very large part of the Democratic Party for whom the beliefs you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=109.64s)]
*  were describing, transgenderism, for example, are religious beliefs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=114.92s)]
*  This is a secular religion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=121.0s)]
*  They can't unlock, because they believe these things. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  They believe in an open border. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=126.16s)]
*  They believe that there really is no such thing as America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  They believe that it's really good to have millions of people flood into this country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=131.14s)]
*  It's really good to have people who don't have to work, that work requirements are inherently [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=136.42s)]
*  bad. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  All of these things are a semi-religious or religious belief system, and that's why they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  can't unlock. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  It's not rational. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  They can't sit down and do a common sense analysis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  They're instead trapped into being for things that are profoundly unpopular with most Americans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=154.22s)]
*  There's an untold story behind this money, too, because Congress has a duty called oversight. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=161.34s)]
*  And there were senators and Congress people that were asking USAID, for example, and other [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=168.34s)]
*  departments for an accounting of their money. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=174.18s)]
*  They would get back nebulous, obscure, obtuse answers, which tells me that the Democrats [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=177.38s)]
*  knew what they were doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  They knew the American people would not want their money spent this way, but they did it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=188.9s)]
*  anyway, and then they basically lied to the American people and would not disclose the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=193.66s)]
*  true nature of the spending that was actually going on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=199.7s)]
*  Look, I mean, you have to accept that there was a lobbyist, bureaucratic empire, that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=202.42s)]
*  that empire took your money, gave it to its friends, even if they were totally incompetent, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=210.18s)]
*  and you'll find case after case where your money went out to systems that just don't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=216.06s)]
*  work. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=220.7s)]
*  They're this crazy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=221.7s)]
*  And at that time, they were taking care of themselves. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=222.7s)]
*  What makes President Trump potentially the most consequential president since Abraham [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  Lincoln is the fact that he's taking a sledgehammer and he is pounding the establishment in a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=231.9s)]
*  way that no one has since Franklin Roosevelt created it in the 1930s. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=239.74s)]
*  He's the first person, and I'm a great fan of Ronald Reagan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=245.22s)]
*  Reagan defeated the Soviet empire, but he didn't try to take on the American establishment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=248.18s)]
*  Trump has had the guts to go straight at it, and I think the American people are going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=253.38000000000002s)]
*  to be with him even more so when they learn how really sickeningly bad it is. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=257.3s)]
*  What do you make—we are expecting sometime very soon, within the next hour, that American [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=263.54s)]
*  Mark Fogel, who has taken American teacher detained by Russia under the Biden years, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=269.74s)]
*  will be in the Trump White House. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=275.74s)]
*  We expect he's back. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=278.18s)]
*  And his special Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, went to Russia and is bringing him home. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  And the president will see him tonight, and there are a lot of people that will greet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=286.18s)]
*  him tonight. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=288.94000000000005s)]
*  How do you interpret what Vladimir Putin is doing here? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=290.48s)]
*  And the president also drew a line in the stand, and he said that all the hostages have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=296.62s)]
*  until noon Saturday to be released by Hamas or all hell will break loose. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=301.38s)]
*  I believe—if I was Hamas and Iran, I'd believe Trump. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, the people who should most be in the target zone are Qatar. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  Qatar has the money. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=319.94s)]
*  Qatar is hosting all the leaders of Hamas in very nice condominiums. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=321.42s)]
*  Qatar is the place to really put the pressure to break Hamas permanently. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=326.66s)]
*  Second, I think what you see happening—and I give Steve Witkoff a lot of credit, both [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  in the Middle East and now with Russia. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  He's a very good negotiator. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  And what you're seeing is Putin is trying to say, you know, I don't want to give up [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=340.62s)]
*  everything, I don't want to surrender, but can't we be friends? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=344.22s)]
*  How many little things can I do to show you that I'm not automatically your enemy? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=348.86s)]
*  And I think with Keith Kellogg as the special envoy, they're very methodically trying [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=353.46s)]
*  to work out what is it that allows Ukraine to survive, what is it that gets Russia to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  stop and do so without a risk of a nuclear war? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think Trump has a very clear sense of what he wants to get done, and inch by inch [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=367.94s)]
*  you're going to see them move towards some kind of very serious truce. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=372.76s)]
*  All right, Mr. Speaker, always good to have you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=377.62s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4GthWGIU4&t=379.5s)]
