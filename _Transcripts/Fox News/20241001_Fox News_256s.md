# Psychological pressure made its way into the White House: Israeli Special Ops Veteran
**Fox News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE)
*  And this is a Fox News alert. The Israeli military says it has begun a quote limited ground [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=0.0s)]
*  invasion in southern Lebanon following Israel strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=6.8s)]
*  Now also tonight Reuters is reporting that Iran's supreme leader the Ayatollah [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=13.84s)]
*  Khamenei is now hiding in a secure location deep underground, obviously fearful of heading to hell [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=19.04s)]
*  where he belongs. And meanwhile you got the New York Times, the AP under fire, rightly so, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  for praising the Hezbollah leader after his death. New York Times publishing this tribute to the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  terrorist leader writing that he wanted equality for all religions and was beloved by many. No, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=37.68s)]
*  he was dedicating to wiping Israel off the map for those dumbasses at the New York Times. And [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  in an updated headline the AP referred to Nasrallah as quote charismatic and shrewd. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=49.6s)]
*  This is how repulsive and corrupt the media is in this country. Here with Reaction Israeli special [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  ops veteran Aaron Kohn is with us. You know after Iran fired directly on Israel I was really impressed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=62.56s)]
*  how deep into Iranian territory Israel was able to penetrate. Then we had the number five four three [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=69.84s)]
*  two and then the number one leader of Hamas all taken out by Israel. Huge military successes in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=77.2s)]
*  each one in their in and on their own merit. And then we have Nasrallah here 32 year leader [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=83.36s)]
*  of Hezbollah. We had the pager incident the walkie talkie incident and Bibi says regime change for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=90.4s)]
*  Iran might come a lot sooner than people think. I would say Israel is probably the mightiest [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=98.64s)]
*  military and smartest military force on the face of this earth. And I say that sadly because I want [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=106.24s)]
*  America to be that and I feel our military has been weakened under Harris and Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=112.88s)]
*  Sean I agree with you 100 percent. I think that America definitely needs to step up how they view [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=118.64s)]
*  the global war war on terror. Israel's had to get after it for the last 11 days. We've been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=124.08s)]
*  systematically taken out terrorists left and right. Starting with the pager operation Sean [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=131.2s)]
*  that's a five year operation right there just to establish and target those resources flippin get [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=136.16s)]
*  them working for us. But here's where I'm out with this Sean. I really Israel doesn't have a choice. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=141.36s)]
*  Israel's got to be good right now. And the reason why Israel's got to move quick. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=147.68s)]
*  I believe that all of that psychological warfare that's being funded by Qatar and by Iran with all [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=151.76s)]
*  those bots that are being engine and fired up which has taken over the brains of the 14 to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=156.8s)]
*  24 year olds and radicalized the entire internet through TikTok has real that psychological [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=161.52s)]
*  pressure Sean I believe made its way into the White House forcing the handcuffs on Israel at [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=166.8s)]
*  Rafa which I believe we would have been able to save Hirsch and those five additional hostages [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=172.24s)]
*  just like we did Sean with Noah Argami. Our hostage rescue teams are the finest in the world [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  and I believe that this same psychological pressure is going to work its way up into the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=182.72s)]
*  Kamala Biden White House and they're going to start putting the brakes on Bibi again. Now we're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=187.28s)]
*  going to see it in Lebanon and so Israel's got to move quick. Bibi's moving quickly. Our shell dog [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=190.96s)]
*  unit our JTAC unit just lays that that giant little hole that we put in the ground taken out [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=196.8s)]
*  in a srala and Israel's got to get those commandos in there to mop up the rest of those elements in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=202.72s)]
*  southern Lebanon. But my fear again is that the White House is weak minded and immune to that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=208.24s)]
*  psychological warfare of lies that's being pumped into the social media handheld devices [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=214.32s)]
*  and there's nothing we can do about that but work quickly Sean. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=222.0s)]
*  And we have a presidential candidate that wants every American to be courageous and never say [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=226.88s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorism. No you've got to defeat the terrorism, win the war. Israel is doing their [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=232.0s)]
*  job. These people are dedicated to destroying the state of Israel. Aaron our prayers are with you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExbHgAwBIwE&t=238.0s)]
