# Trump’s DHS secretary: We’re picking up the ‘worst of the worst’
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA)
*  All right, joining us now, DHS secretary Kristi Noem is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Secretary, great to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=4.4s)]
*  Boy, that didn't take long. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=6.76s)]
*  You got to work really, really quick. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=8.48s)]
*  You were out with—in protective vests. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=11.08s)]
*  You were embedded with ice last night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=14.42s)]
*  You got these dirt bags, as you call them, including the Trend Day Aragwa ringleader, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=17.44s)]
*  which is a huge get, I think, for your department and for Tom Homan and for all these agents. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=24.12s)]
*  Congratulations on a successful raid last night in New York. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=31.28s)]
*  Well, Sean, we've just gotten started. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=34.84s)]
*  We are picking up the worst of the worst in this country that are making our streets so [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=38.2s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=41.6s)]
*  And so, yes, we did encounter and incarcerate a Trend Day Aragwa member, one of the ringleaders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=42.6s)]
*  He had warrants out for his arrest in Colorado. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, he was one of those that we saw on some of the video from that apartment building [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=50.0s)]
*  that they had taken over and had perpetuated so much violence there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  So this was a good morning for our agents and the cooperation with the NYPD and ATF [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  and DEA. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=65.0s)]
*  We had a great partnership going and did several of these arrests. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  And the community is safer now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=71.12s)]
*  That's the reality of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Everybody who has been concerned about walking their children to school or spending and doing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=74.48s)]
*  business in these communities now know that New York City is safer because these dangerous [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=79.84s)]
*  criminals are gone and they're no longer living in their community. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=83.72s)]
*  What a difference a couple of days can make. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=89.08s)]
*  I mean, I saw when you were sworn in by Clarence Thomas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  I was very happy for you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=93.64s)]
*  We've known each other a long time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=95.8s)]
*  You did a great job as governor. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=97.12s)]
*  Seeing you, though, out with agents in that protective ice vest embedded with these federal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=99.44s)]
*  agents and going after target after target in New York, you I also understand it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=105.72s)]
*  You got a number of criminal illegal aliens, those with kidnapping, assault charges, burglary [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=112.44s)]
*  charges. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=119.44s)]
*  This was a very successful raid. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=120.44s)]
*  It was. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=124.08s)]
*  And I appreciate the president following through on what he promised the American people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=125.08s)]
*  He promised them he would make America safe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=128.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  So going in all night long and doing these targeted raids against these criminal aliens [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=132.64s)]
*  was very specific. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=139.0s)]
*  And we pulling them out, obviously, we're going to gather more information about some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=141.0s)]
*  more of the criminals that are out there doing these activities. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=144.68s)]
*  So this this ringleader had just tried to buy some grenades. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  He had been a part of a gun by before. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=151.64s)]
*  We talk about families that are losing their kids to violence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=154.16s)]
*  They're losing our next generation of American to drugs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=157.04s)]
*  These folks are perpetuating that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=160.24s)]
*  And we're going to get them out of here and make sure that we're continuing to build [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=161.96s)]
*  on that and know that the American people are truly being hurt, that they're being [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  listened to and that these agents are going out with the support that they need in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=169.24s)]
*  cooperation of local governments to do what they need to do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=172.72s)]
*  We estimate that anywhere between 12 to 15 million unvetted Harris Biden illegals came [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=178.0s)]
*  into the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=183.84s)]
*  We know that among that group are known terrorists, but we don't know where they are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=185.44s)]
*  We know among that group are cartel members, but we don't know where all of them are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=190.08s)]
*  and gang members. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=194.96s)]
*  We know we we have tens of thousands of murderers, rapists and other violent criminals. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=196.08s)]
*  We've seen Americans murdered, raped, including young children. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=202.96s)]
*  We have a fentanyl problem, other violent crime. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=207.96s)]
*  How it seems like the enormity of this task of finding these people seems incalculable [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=211.24s)]
*  to me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  How do we find them all? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, Sean, we have some of these folks on our radar when they commit crimes, though, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  in this country, we need to not release them again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=227.8s)]
*  And working with the mayor of New York City was fantastic. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=230.76s)]
*  I talked to him four or five times last night about what we were doing, our operations, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=234.2s)]
*  how they could support us. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=238.44s)]
*  We also need these sanctuary city laws to be lifted so that we can use the full authorities, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=240.16s)]
*  that when we bring up these people and when we capture them, that we can prosecute them [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=244.32s)]
*  and that we can truly get them out of this country so that they can't continue their [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=248.72s)]
*  ring of violence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=252.4s)]
*  So these are the worst of the worst. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=253.4s)]
*  And we need mayors and governors partnering with us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=255.92s)]
*  But we will do our job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=257.84s)]
*  We will do our job regardless of that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=259.52s)]
*  And we will continue to go forward and identify these folks and get them out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=261.56s)]
*  And these agents did good work and fantastic work. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=266.04s)]
*  They're very dedicated. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=269.44s)]
*  They're so happy, Sean, they finally get to do their job. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=270.44s)]
*  They're so happy they finally get to get these dirtbags out of our country and to actually [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=272.84s)]
*  fulfill the mission to which they took their oath of their office to be protecting their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  communities. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  So the community, while I was spending time there, were grateful. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=283.11999999999995s)]
*  When they'd walk by us, they would say thank you several times and saw us pulling people [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=286.55999999999995s)]
*  out of these apartment buildings where they knew there was dangerous individuals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=291.02s)]
*  We saw kids coming out of these apartment buildings that had to live in these situations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=294.52s)]
*  It's going to be a much better situation the more that we can target this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=299.0s)]
*  And we'll gather more and more information and continue to remove dangerous criminals [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=301.88s)]
*  out of this country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=306.4s)]
*  Remember, that's what President Trump said. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=307.4s)]
*  We're going to start with the worst and we're going to continue to go after them and remove [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=308.4s)]
*  them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  The cartels and the people that are on the terrorist watch list, when we find you, there [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  will be consequences and we will remove you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  We are saving people's lives because of the actions that we're taking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=320.24s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=324.28s)]
*  And I call them the state-run legacy media mob. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=326.32s)]
*  They've been so—oh, this is very expensive, deporting people as if it's not expensive [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=329.32s)]
*  to offer them free food and housing and healthcare and education and Kamala wanted, you know, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=335.56s)]
*  taxpayer-funded sex change operations. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=341.92s)]
*  That's more expensive. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=343.92s)]
*  My next question, do you plan on going on a lot more of these raids? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=345.56s)]
*  Is this something you will do on a regular basis? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=349.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=351.76s)]
*  I will be out there with our agents and with our law enforcement officers, our border patrol, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=353.6s)]
*  ICE, HSILB, with all of them because I think that when I'm there, they know they have [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=358.12s)]
*  a leader that supports them, but also I'm learning from them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=362.76s)]
*  I'm learning what tools they need, what authorities they need to truly—that when they arrest [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=366.12s)]
*  someone and turn them over to the process that's in front of them, that there actually [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=370.52s)]
*  can be consequences and we can prosecute them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=374.88s)]
*  Talking about the difference in some of these sanctuary cities, how they're just released [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=378.12s)]
*  as soon as they come into our custody and not necessarily our custody, but the local [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=382.2s)]
*  government. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=386.76s)]
*  So I need to tell that story and then be the liaison to help get those local leaders on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=387.76s)]
*  board and talk to the community so they see the good work that we're doing as well. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=392.12s)]
*  And remind them, you know, President Trump said that he would take action. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=396.32s)]
*  He's—we're encountering and arresting three times the amount of criminal aliens that the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=400.24s)]
*  Biden administration did by average and we're having less than 10 percent the amount of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=405.52s)]
*  encounters at the southern border because we've sent the message clearly to the world, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=410.28s)]
*  don't come here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2R4wOSk9XA&t=414.59999999999997s)]
