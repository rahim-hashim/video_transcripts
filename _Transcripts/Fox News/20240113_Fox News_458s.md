# Nikki Haley: Biden has been too slow and too weak on everything
**Fox News:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU)
*  Carolina governor and UN ambassador and 2024 presidential Republican presidential candidate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=0.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=5.96s)]
*  You know, it seems that the economy gets the most play because that impacts people's lives [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=6.96s)]
*  daily. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=13.0s)]
*  But peace and prosperity historically drive elections. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=14.0s)]
*  We now have conflicts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=18.66s)]
*  We have war in Europe. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=19.66s)]
*  We have war in the Middle East. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=20.84s)]
*  We have Iran sponsoring terror. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=23.2s)]
*  They're the ones that have been providing all their military equipment, their proxy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=27.48s)]
*  war against Saudi Arabia, their missiles being fired into Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=31.84s)]
*  You know, so I guess it raises the obvious question about foreign policy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=36.44s)]
*  You know, what would the Nikki Haley doctrine be on all three of these issues? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=39.84s)]
*  First of all, Sean, I mean, it is a constant topic of conversation that comes up with voters [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=48.04s)]
*  here in Iowa. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=52.68s)]
*  We've also seen it in New Hampshire. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=54.24s)]
*  People are worried. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=56.28s)]
*  They see those wars and they're worried about what this means. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=57.28s)]
*  We should always be focused on national security and prevention of war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=60.56s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden's missed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=65.12s)]
*  The reason all this has happened is because he's been too slow and too weak on everything. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=66.48s)]
*  We saw it from Afghanistan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=71.4s)]
*  We saw it in the fact that Putin surrounded Ukraine a whole year before and he did nothing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=73.48s)]
*  We see it now with Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=78.6s)]
*  They smell blood in the water. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=80.44s)]
*  And so what they're doing is they're taking advantage of every situation because they [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=82.14s)]
*  know Joe isn't. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=85.82s)]
*  And what bothers me even more than that, I've told people what keeps me up at night is what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=87.46s)]
*  happens between now and Election Day, because you just showed that clip of Joe Biden. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=92.66s)]
*  It didn't even feel like he knew where he was. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=97.61999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's chilling. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  I mean, when I first started pointing this out, which was in the election of 2020, you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=103.33999999999999s)]
*  know, I was actually excoriated by some for stating the obvious that he was weak and frail [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=108.06s)]
*  and a cognitive mess. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=113.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=114.94000000000001s)]
*  But more specifically, what should America's role in the world stage be? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden is, you know, he wants over what, $200 million billion going to the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=120.14s)]
*  Ukraine war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  That's that to me looks like a proxy war between us and Russia. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  Joe is pressuring Israel, you know, for a ceasefire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=132.58s)]
*  And if I was president, I'd be telling Israel, go win your war. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  You're a victim of terror. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=140.5s)]
*  If you extrapolate the population out of Israel and compare it to the U.S., that would be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=142.2s)]
*  the equivalent of losing 40,000 Americans on October the 7th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=146.28s)]
*  My advice to them would be to beat back Hamas in the south, Hezbollah in the north, to take [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=150.8s)]
*  on Iran and take out their refineries and probably their nuclear sites if they want [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=158.4s)]
*  peace in the region for a long period of time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=164.48s)]
*  I think they've got to they've got to win the war and secure their nation because they're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  surrounded by a lot of enemies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=171.56s)]
*  Well, the first thing I'll tell you is we should never give cash to any country, friend [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=175.4s)]
*  or foe, because you can't follow it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  You can't hold it accountable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=182.68s)]
*  You know, take these one at a time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=185.08s)]
*  You look at Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=186.6s)]
*  Here's a pro-American freedom loving country who was invaded by a thug. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=188.04s)]
*  Half a million people have died and been wounded because of Putin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=192.52s)]
*  But why should America care about Ukraine? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=196.04s)]
*  That's a legitimate question to ask. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=198.32s)]
*  The problem is Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=200.08s)]
*  We know and I saw this every day at the UN. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=204.36s)]
*  Dictators, thugs and terrorists tell us exactly what they're going to do. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=207.08s)]
*  They're amazingly transparent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=210.36s)]
*  Hamas said they were going to go into Israel. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  They did. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  We watched it. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  It happened. China says Taiwan is next. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=221.96s)]
*  Those are NATO countries. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  That puts America at war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=229.4s)]
*  This is about preventing war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=231.0s)]
*  It's always been about preventing war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  And if we were to support Ukraine with just equipment and ammunition, no cash. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=234.84s)]
*  That's only three and a half percent of our defense budget. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=240.24s)]
*  The Europeans have paid more than that and they should. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  It's their neighborhood. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=245.0s)]
*  When it comes to Israel, they're the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  They're a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=250.84s)]
*  It has never been that Israel needs America. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=253.0s)]
*  It has always been America needs Israel. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=256.32s)]
*  And when you look at the fact that on that terrible day of October 7th, when they beheaded those people and burned those babies alive and took those girls from the concert and raped them and dragged their naked bodies through the streets of Gaza, what did they say? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=259.16s)]
*  Death to Israel, death to America. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=273.0s)]
*  And if you look back on that horrific day, Sean, of October 7th, that was Putin's birthday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=275.6s)]
*  Putin had hit rock bottom. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=282.0s)]
*  We know that because he had lost 87 percent of his fighting force that started the war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=283.48s)]
*  They'd raised the draft age to 65. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  They were getting drones from Iran and missiles from North Korea. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=290.84s)]
*  Who's the happiest person in the world right now? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=293.8s)]
*  It's Putin. Why? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  Because the U.S. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  and the West took their eyes off of Ukraine and moved it to Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=299.08s)]
*  Putin never called Netanyahu after that, not for 10 days. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=303.44s)]
*  You know who he did call? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=306.52s)]
*  He called Hamas, invited them to Russia. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=307.64s)]
*  They came the next day and they held hands as friends. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=309.76s)]
*  Russia, China and Iran are bound together in an unholy alliance because they hate freedom. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=312.68s)]
*  They hate democracy and more than anything, they hate America. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=318.2s)]
*  I call it the next. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=321.8s)]
*  It is a new axis of evil. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=323.04s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=324.6s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden did not demand that Europe protect their own continent first. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  They should have put the bulk of money. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=333.2s)]
*  Joe Biden then put handcuffs on Zelensky and said, oh, you can't take Migs from Poland. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=335.0s)]
*  They offered him 28 Migs at the time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=339.88s)]
*  Then he said, oh, and you can't use cluster bombs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, at that point, we're throwing our money down the drain because Joe's not allowing Ukraine. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  And they have fought valiantly. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=351.24s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=353.12s)]
*  Putin's a thug and a murderer and a dictator. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  But Joe Biden put handcuffs on their ability to fight the war as it relates to Israel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  You're exactly right. You're exactly right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  And on Israel, all he needed to say is go win your war and stop the behind the scenes [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=365.56s)]
*  way as one message publicly, one message privately. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  All my sources in Israel say he is putting pressure on Israel not to have a ceasefire, not [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=375.16s)]
*  and not continue the conflict. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  No, the message should be beat back the terrorists that were raping, murdering and killing your [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  citizens in the dark of night. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  And Joe Biden doesn't seem to have that philosophy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=390.6s)]
*  And he's allowed Iran and Russia to get rich because of his energy policies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=393.16s)]
*  All of that is impactful to the entire world. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=399.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And that's why our friends don't trust us at this point. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=404.08s)]
*  And that's why our enemies don't fear us. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zo3qq18fIU&t=407.76s)]
