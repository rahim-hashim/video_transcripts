# Biden has been AWOL for 4 years, Tammy Bruce says
**Fox News:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk)
*  With reaction is Fox News contributor, Tammy Bruce and former Clinton [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=0.0s)]
*  advisor and democratic pollster Doug Schoen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=4.0s)]
*  Uh, thank you both for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  Uh, Tammy, you, uh, you watch this, you watch this closely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=9.18s)]
*  I can't imagine why and how the president can justify going to Italy and why that's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=13.26s)]
*  in the best interest of the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=17.78s)]
*  But he's been absent, but nobody cares. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=20.34s)]
*  It put us in perspective. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=22.82s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=25.26s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=25.78s)]
*  When they say he's been AWOL over the last few days or weeks, he's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  been AWOL for four years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=32.56s)]
*  We've discussed this on various programs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=33.08s)]
*  Certainly Sean's always discussed it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=35.92s)]
*  You've been on top of it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=37.56s)]
*  Uh, Douglas knows this has been the case from the beginning and it has been [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=39.0s)]
*  disturbing that we've, you know, the country and certain legacy media is kind [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=45.84s)]
*  of suspended disbelief that this has always been fine and this is, this is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  the Democrats are, this is their usual standard procedure here without this guy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=55.26s)]
*  The good news is Donald Trump actually had his first victory that awful 1500 page, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=61.44s)]
*  uh, debacle, uh, woke debacle, uh, was, uh, eliminated, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=68.78s)]
*  That was something that the Republicans and Johnson was going to move ahead with. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=74.4s)]
*  And that has been stopped. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=78.94s)]
*  And they're getting down to at least, I don't know if president Trump will be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=80.62s)]
*  entirely happy with this first stage, but they're actually going to get some [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=84.34s)]
*  business done if we wanted business as usual, as per your conversation with the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=88.12s)]
*  Senator, we would have elected Biden again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=92.84s)]
*  I mean, this statement, the election of Trump and Vance and, and the cabinet [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=96.64s)]
*  that he's put together is a statement and a recognition about what the American [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  people want. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=106.2s)]
*  So yes, this has been our problem and deserves investigation when Trump is in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=106.72s)]
*  office is exactly what has been going on for four years in the white house. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=112.2s)]
*  Doug, did the Democrats, I mean, how do they look anybody in the eye? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=118.38s)]
*  They seem to claim, oh, we were oblivious to the, how absent he was. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  We were oblivious to his cognitive decline. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=129.94s)]
*  I mean, how do they have any credibility on this topic? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=130.74s)]
*  And, and certainly we're near the midst of a budget negotiation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=134.38s)]
*  I mean, the guy should be there on the phones, working the phones, working with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=137.58s)]
*  senators, working with the house members, and he's just absolutely nowhere. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=141.72s)]
*  You know, the problem for me, Jason, is I wish I could disagree with you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=146.92s)]
*  And as Tammy acknowledged, this is something that people across the aisle have seen, but [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=152.92s)]
*  we Democrats haven't been as candid as we need to be. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=158.94s)]
*  And if we had been, we probably would have had a more robust nominating process and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=162.8s)]
*  potentially nominated a stronger candidate than Kamala Harris. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=168.18s)]
*  So it's been effectively a fraud on the American people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=172.78s)]
*  And I dare say has hurt my party in being competitive in the recently completed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=176.98s)]
*  elections. I frankly think that Joe Biden, given that report about Afghanistan, was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=182.8s)]
*  not fully capable of making decisions during the bulk of his presidency. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=188.9s)]
*  And we, the American people, have been the losers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=193.72s)]
*  Effectively now Tammy's right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=196.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is the president, not Joe Biden. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=198.36s)]
*  Doug, that's why we love you, because you call balls and strikes and you're right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  There's no defending this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  But Tammy, it's amazing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=209.56s)]
*  It's amazing how many people were complicit from the national media to the family [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  members, to the senior staff, to the senators around him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=217.36s)]
*  How could they let this go for four years, as you said? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=222.38s)]
*  Well, you know, this, the bureaucracy has always believed that they're the ones who [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  run the country, that a president does not matter, that they're the ones who who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=232.7s)]
*  matter. They're the ones who make the decisions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  They're the ones who are there forever. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  And so that hubris comes through. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=243.26s)]
*  They were panicked. And this also tells you about the lack of talent on the Democrat [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  side. Sorry, Douglas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=250.36s)]
*  But that Biden was their only choice. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, this is it's a serious situation for the country because the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=254.84s)]
*  Republicans need obviously a loyal opposition. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=259.52s)]
*  And this country expects it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=264.0s)]
*  And the founders expected it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=265.72s)]
*  But you have people now and this is the unconstitutional quandary here, is that we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=267.76s)]
*  have a president who is answerable, who has a lot of power and is answerable to the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=274.36s)]
*  people through the elections and can be impeached, can be removed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=278.85999999999996s)]
*  But when you have a faceless, nameless, unelected bureaucracy that may make [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=283.02s)]
*  horrific decisions, destroy the military, destroy the country, who do you punish? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=288.34s)]
*  Who do you bring forward? Because none of them are known. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=294.9s)]
*  And then they they slink back as they expect to do into the system itself, into [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  the bureaucracy to continue. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  That is not what the Constitution demands. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=306.04s)]
*  It's not what the American people want. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  And as we've seen, Jason, it destroys things because everybody knows who's doing it, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=311.52s)]
*  that they'll have no repercussions publicly or when it comes to their jobs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=316.6s)]
*  Doug, we only have a few seconds left, but I want to make sure you get the last word [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  here. Yeah, what I took from today, which was heartwarming and beneficial, is that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=325.88s)]
*  there was a bipartisan vote of about three thirty six, if I remember correctly, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=332.98s)]
*  for the bill. This suggests that with a common sense, centrist agenda [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=338.38s)]
*  on crime, the budget and on the border, we can potentially do serious business [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=344.82s)]
*  as the negotiations on the on immigration are suggesting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=351.66s)]
*  Let's hope that's what comes for it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=355.66s)]
*  And Joe Biden, he's MIA and gone. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's to the good. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, great point. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  Tami, thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=364.66s)]
*  And by the way, thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=365.66s)]
*  Justification for going to Italy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=368.82s)]
*  Have a wonderful Merry Christmas. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYxySb8cIfk&t=369.90000000000003s)]
