# Sean Hannity: Trump Derangement Syndrome is very real
**Fox News:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4)
*  Now, the threats against Donald Trump, they are very real. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=0.0s)]
*  The lack of urgency, the lack of accountability at the DHS, and frankly, the entire Biden-Harris [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=3.48s)]
*  administration is beyond appalling. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=9.18s)]
*  Make no mistake, Donald Trump has a huge base of devoted supporters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=11.82s)]
*  Now, there are Americans who would walk over hot calls to vote for him, and they will. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=15.92s)]
*  But there are also people who hate the former president with a passion, which has now made [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=21.34s)]
*  the number one target in terms of assassination in our country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=26.88s)]
*  He has a lot of enemies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=32.32s)]
*  The Democratic Party, state-run media mob, the deep state, government officials. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=33.8s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome is very real. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  They have demonized him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  They have besmirched him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=43.72s)]
*  They have smeared him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=44.84s)]
*  They have slandered him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=45.84s)]
*  They have created a caricature of him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=46.92s)]
*  In less than a decade, Donald Trump has gone from a billionaire celebrity, beloved by Democrats [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=49.16s)]
*  and the media, to a Republican. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  These same people now refer to constantly as a threat to democracy because Donald Trump's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  politics and rhetoric did not align with this Democratic machine, and many on the left have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=62.16s)]
*  done nothing but vilify him and even at times glorified violence against him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=68.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=73.56s)]
*  That man cannot see public office again. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=75.0s)]
*  He is not only unfit, he is destructive to our democracy, and he has to be eliminated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=79.0s)]
*  The donor class can't just sit back on the sidelines and say, oh, well, don't worry, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=87.24s)]
*  this will all work itself out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=91.12s)]
*  They're still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=92.88s)]
*  fact. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=95.56s)]
*  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=96.56s)]
*  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=102.28s)]
*  I want to clarify, I'm not an actor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  I lie for a living. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=109.76s)]
*  However, it's been a while. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=113.76s)]
*  And maybe it's time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=118.28s)]
*  How dare he say the things he does. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=119.76s)]
*  Of course I want to punch him in the face. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=121.64s)]
*  Press always ask me, don't I wish I were debating him? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  No, I wish you were in high school, I could take you behind the gym. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=128.28s)]
*  That's what I wish. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=131.4s)]
*  And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=133.08s)]
*  Can you imagine any conservatives said anything similar about any Democrat? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=138.68s)]
*  Now, even Trump's 2020 opponent once joked about killing the former president, you might [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=144.12s)]
*  recall, and it's not funny. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence or Jeff [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=152.0s)]
*  Sessions, who would it be? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  Does one of us have to come out alive? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=159.28s)]
*  Now, for years, Donald Trump, his family, his supporters have been vilified, dehumanized. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=161.56s)]
*  Falsely, they create this, the ridiculous caricature of him that remains in the minds [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  of too many people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=179.88s)]
*  But despite nonstop hysteria, let's see, the Russia hoax, the Mueller witch hunt, the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=181.48s)]
*  two bogus impeachment, Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian disinformation dossier, a weaponized [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=187.0s)]
*  DOJ, they cannot erase a simple fact. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=193.64s)]
*  And that is that Donald Trump's presidency was marked by sound policies and stability, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=197.2s)]
*  and you are not better off four years with having had Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=204.0s)]
*  office. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=209.2s)]
*  Back when Trump was president, the economy was strong. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=210.2s)]
*  It was rebounding well from COVID. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=212.76s)]
*  The world was a far more peaceful place. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Gas was cheap. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=217.72s)]
*  Productivity was high. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  He set record after record low unemployment for every demographic in the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=220.88s)]
*  Our borders, they were secure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=225.6s)]
*  Trump did not cause a world war or become a dictator. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=227.84s)]
*  He upheld the U.S. Constitution. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=231.22s)]
*  He worked within three branches of government to implement his agenda. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=233.0s)]
*  Democrats, the mob, the media, well, they lie repeatedly and say Donald Trump is a threat [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=236.88s)]
*  to democracy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  What do people think when they hear this? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=244.58s)]
*  You decide. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  Watch what happens. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  It's a danger. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  It's a genuine danger to American security. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump presents a challenge and a threat fundamentally to the republic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=254.10000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and our most fundamental freedoms. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=259.94s)]
*  Don't give them the power. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=265.38s)]
*  Look, are they a threat to democracy? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=266.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=267.66s)]
*  Are they going to take our rights away? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=268.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=269.66s)]
*  You're saying that Donald Trump isn't exactly like Mussolini, exactly like Hitler? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=270.66s)]
*  He is that guy? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=275.1s)]
*  Donald Trump presents an existential threat to democracy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=276.1s)]
*  He is advertised he is going to transition this country from a democracy to a dictatorship. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=280.06s)]
*  He is paving the way to become a Vladimir Putin or to become an Adolf Hitler or a Kim [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=284.94000000000005s)]
*  Jong-un. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  That's what he wants to be. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  We have to defeat a person who is a threat to our democracy of the kind that we have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=293.96s)]
*  not seen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=300.52s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, two psychotic Democrats took that rhetoric to heart and now tried to murder Donald Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=305.32s)]
*  And yet the White House continues to fan the flames, according to Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=311.52s)]
*  The real danger is coming from anyone who attempts to question their radical and extreme [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=316.5s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=321.96s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=322.96s)]
*  How many more assassination attempts on Donald Trump until the president and the vice president [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=324.52s)]
*  and you pick a different word to describe Trump other than threat? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  Peter, if anything from this administration, I actually completely disagree with the premise [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=334.96s)]
*  of your question, the question that you're asking. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=344.32s)]
*  It is also incredibly dangerous in the way that you're asking it because American people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=347.96s)]
*  are watching. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=353.88s)]
*  A lot of people are listening, too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=354.88s)]
*  Just to recap, Democrats told everyone Trump was evil. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  The next coming of Hitler plotting to end American democracy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=361.68s)]
*  People make direct threats about blowing up the White House, assassinating Donald Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  Nothing happens to them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=370.28s)]
*  Two people then try to assassinate Donald Trump while he's running for reelection. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=371.88s)]
*  The White House thinks it's dangerous for anyone to ask about the extreme rhetoric coming [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=376.2s)]
*  from their side. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=381.08s)]
*  Of course, Democrats are not going to make any effort to bring down the temperature. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=382.56s)]
*  Just one day after Trump was almost killed, Hillary Clinton, she goes on MSDNC and told [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=387.08s)]
*  the network's top conspiracy theorists and their viewers that Trump is a danger to the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=392.76s)]
*  country and the entire world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=398.24s)]
*  The day after he got shot or attempted, a guy attempted to kill him, he had a wannabe [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=400.76s)]
*  assassin in the bushes and thankfully he was stopped. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=406.08s)]
*  One day after. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=410.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=411.28s)]
*  Journalists should, you know, really try to achieve objectivity and by that he said, I [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=412.28s)]
*  mean, they should cover the object. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=418.28s)]
*  Well, the object in this case is Donald Trump, his demagoguery, his danger to our country [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=420.44s)]
*  and the world and stick with it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=428.18s)]
*  I'd actually like Hillary to explain how she, you know, had funds that she funneled [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=434.02s)]
*  through a law firm to an op research firm to and a former MI6 agent and got Russian [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=440.22s)]
*  disinformation that was used for four FISA wards. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=446.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=449.86s)]
*  You know, curious people would like to know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=450.86s)]
*  I'd like to know how Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=453.26s)]
*  She held accountable for that or had top secret classified information on her servers. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=457.62s)]
*  I'd like to know all that too. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=462.14s)]
*  Hillary Clinton so deeply worried about the spread of misinformation while she now wants [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=463.9s)]
*  Americans to be thrown in jail for posting so-called misinformation online. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=468.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=473.08s)]
*  I think it's important to indict the Russians just as Mueller indicted a lot of Russians [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=474.38s)]
*  were engaged in direct election interference and boosting Trump back in 2016. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=481.82s)]
*  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda and whether [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=488.78s)]
*  they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=496.78s)]
*  be a better deterrent. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=502.8s)]
*  And of course, with the DOJ, the weaponized DOJ of Harris and Biden, they think if you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=506.94s)]
*  talk about inflation, you could be spreading Russian disinformation even though it's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=512.14s)]
*  completely true. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=517.1s)]
*  Never forget Hillary Clinton, her campaign funneled that money through that law firm [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=518.46s)]
*  to hire an ex-foreign spy that put together the dirty Russian disinformation dossier, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  which has been completely debunked, although it was then used by James Comey and others [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=528.78s)]
*  to get four FISA warrants to backdoor spy on Donald Trump, the candidate, the president, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=534.22s)]
*  and she and all of her co-conspirators and all of those who peddled their lies were never [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=540.46s)]
*  held accountable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=544.76s)]
*  This is the very definition of election interference. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=546.24s)]
*  Hillary, her campaign, were even forced to pay a huge fine for lying about the dossier, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=548.82s)]
*  calling it a legal expense. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=555.34s)]
*  If she lived in New York and they actually had equal justice under the law, she would [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=557.5400000000001s)]
*  have been tried for that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=561.46s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, frankly, the queen herself of misinformation. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=563.02s)]
*  And so, of course, she appears on the show's country—on this country's, you know, number [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=567.02s)]
*  one conspiracy theorist show on MSDNC and spreads more propaganda and lies. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=572.02s)]
*  Now, of course, most Democrats, they don't really care about misinformation or democracy [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=577.1s)]
*  or divisive rhetoric. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=582.02s)]
*  They use it all the time. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=583.38s)]
*  Now, these are merely tools that they use to gain and hold onto power. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=584.7s)]
*  It's a means to an end. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=589.02s)]
*  And of course, when something bad happens, like an assassination attempt against Trump, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=590.82s)]
*  then they just blame Donald Trump. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=595.42s)]
*  I can't make this up. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=597.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=598.5s)]
*  Just the fact that right now you have a former president who, yes, has been the target of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=599.5s)]
*  apparent assassinations twice, but is also an instigator of political violence. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=605.18s)]
*  So you know, you can't—you don't get to be a very big part of the problem and then [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=610.98s)]
*  pretend that it's just the other people on the other side who caused this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=616.42s)]
*  I mean, the irony of it is that the violence, the actual violence we're seeing, comes [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=620.5799999999999s)]
*  much more disproportionately from MAGA themselves. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Do you expect to hear anything from the Trump campaign about toning down the rhetoric, toning [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=628.18s)]
*  down the violence, or would that be atypical of the former president? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=633.5s)]
*  You hear this fight, fight, fight chant, which you heard Trump do right after the shooting [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=637.86s)]
*  in Butler. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=644.0999999999999s)]
*  We saw that once again on Truth Social. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=645.82s)]
*  That does scare me a little bit. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZmZxKKSs4&t=649.74s)]
