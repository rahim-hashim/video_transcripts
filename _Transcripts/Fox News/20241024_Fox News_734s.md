# Sean Hannity: Democrats can't be happy tonight
**Fox News:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight, Democrats, they have failed Americans, all of you across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=0.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=6.26s)]
*  Their policies have caused backbreaking inflation, rising crime, a housing crisis, and of course [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=7.26s)]
*  an illegal immigration crisis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It has created one of the biggest national security threats in the history of our country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=15.92s)]
*  We now have known terrorists inside our country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=20.7s)]
*  Iranian hit squads, we know, are in the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=23.76s)]
*  We have gang members, people that have murdered Americans, raped Americans, violent crimes [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=26.72s)]
*  committed against Americans. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=31.34s)]
*  We have cartels and the list can go on and on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=33.18s)]
*  And now, even simple tasks have become worse under the radical policies of Harris and Biden. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=36.64s)]
*  You can't even buy laundry detergent without having to call over a cashier in some stores [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=42.28s)]
*  to unlock some glass security case. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=48.28s)]
*  That is, if you can actually afford it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  And gassing up, yeah, buck, buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  How does that feel every time you fill up your car? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=56.32s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=58.52s)]
*  Now, no matter how hard you work, the American dream is now getting out of reach for so many [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=59.52s)]
*  people, two-thirds of Americans saying they're gulping water, Washington Post even suggesting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=64.84s)]
*  that Americans now need to give up on the American dream of a house or the backyard, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=70.28s)]
*  settle for a townhouse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=75.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=77.76s)]
*  We should settle? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=78.76s)]
*  No, how about we aspire to? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=79.76s)]
*  And the media mob and the left-wing, you know, in this country scratching their heads, why [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=83.2s)]
*  is Donald Trump doing so well? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=87.48s)]
*  It's not sexism, as suggested by Barack Obama, or racism and sexism suggested byâ€”of African-American [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=90.0s)]
*  men as alleged by Stacey Abrams. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=98.88s)]
*  Pretty insulting comments. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  These surrogates for Kamala, they're not doing too well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=103.08s)]
*  They're not helping her. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=106.08s)]
*  Coming up tonight, we'll check in with my buddy, our friend Stephen A. Smith. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=107.88s)]
*  He will join us with more on why Kamala Harris is actually losing so much support from African-American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  men and Hispanic-American men. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=117.12s)]
*  But let's be clear about this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  The serious problems that are facing most Americans, they're not going to get better [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=121.12s)]
*  under a Harris administration. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=126.48s)]
*  She even said, I'd change nothing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=128.88s)]
*  At best, that would be the best-case scenario. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=131.0s)]
*  She'd be a continuation of Joe Biden, which in and of itself is a continuation of American [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=133.4s)]
*  decline. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=140.12s)]
*  At worst, she will embrace her stated positions, her own words, those core, radical, extreme [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=141.12s)]
*  socialist Marxist values, and kind of turn America into Venezuela. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, during a disastrous town hall last night, Kamala failed to take any responsibility for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=152.84s)]
*  the failures of the Harris-Biden administration and could not or would not say how the next [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  four years would be any different. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=164.28s)]
*  It was a disaster last night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=166.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=168.28s)]
*  Some voters, though, might ask, you've been in the White House for four years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  You were vice president, not the president. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  But why wasn't any of that done in the last four years? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, there was a lot that was done, but there's more to do, Anderson. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=177.92s)]
*  And I'm pointing out things that need to be done, that haven't been done but need to be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=181.76s)]
*  done. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=185.88s)]
*  And I'm not going to shy away from saying, hey, these are still problems that we need [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=186.88s)]
*  to fix. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  Haven't been done, need to be done. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  We have to do them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=196.16s)]
*  I can't take it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=197.16s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=198.16s)]
*  Apparently, your border czar, Kamala Harris, was just not prepared for a question about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=199.68s)]
*  illegal immigration or her hypocrisy on the border wall. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=204.12s)]
*  She once called that Donald Trump medieval vanity project. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=208.64s)]
*  How wasâ€”how was it even possible? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=212.92s)]
*  She didn't have an answer for this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=216.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=217.8s)]
*  Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=218.8s)]
*  You called it stupid, useless and a medieval vanity project. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=222.32s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=226.98s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=236.84s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=237.84s)]
*  But you're agreeing to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=238.84s)]
*  that wall. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=242.44s)]
*  Weâ€”I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=243.44s)]
*  and secure our border. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=251.44s)]
*  To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=252.44s)]
*  It does call for $650 million that was earmarked under Trump to actually still go to build [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=255.4s)]
*  the wall. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=260.28s)]
*  I am not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=261.28s)]
*  You know, you say you don't think it's stupid anymore. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it wasâ€”did not make much sense because he actually didn't [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=265.08s)]
*  do much of anything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=269.68s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=274.0s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=275.0s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=277.28s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=279.68s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=282.84s)]
*  Just to get a simple answer, tonight Kamala Harris is getting mocked and ridiculed for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=284.56s)]
*  that performance, especially when she declared her only weakness was that she cares too much [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=288.64s)]
*  and she works too hard and surrounds herself with good people and everything. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=293.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=298.24s)]
*  What weaknesses do you bring to the table, and how do you plan to overcome them while [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=299.68s)]
*  you're in office? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  That's a great question, Joe. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, I am certainly not perfect. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=306.84s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think that perhaps a weakness, some would say, but I actually think it's a strength, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=311.48s)]
*  is I really do value having a team of very smart people around me who bring to my decision-making [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  process different perspectives. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=329.04s)]
*  And that is why I engage and bring folks around. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  So I may not be quick to have the answer as soon as you ask it about a specific policy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=336.64s)]
*  issue sometimes, because I'm going to want to research it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=341.96s)]
*  I'm going to want to study it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=345.24s)]
*  I'm kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  And some might call that a weakness. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  The giggling, the non-answer, you know, the passage of time is about time passing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  about people in the community that like the community because they live together in the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=364.32s)]
*  community as a community. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=368.32s)]
*  Democrats cannot be happy tonight. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=370.92s)]
*  One political analyst of fake news CNN said Kamala participated in a one-person debate [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  and she lost. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=379.56s)]
*  David Axelrod called her performance prettyâ€”I wish I'd thought of itâ€”a word salad city. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=380.8s)]
*  And frustration and despair at fake news CNN was palpable. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=387.6s)]
*  You know if you lost CNN, you lost. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=392.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=397.08s)]
*  The things that would concern me is when she doesn't want to answer a question, her habit [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=398.36s)]
*  is to kind of go to word salad city. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=403.52s)]
*  And she did that on a couple of answers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  One was on Israel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=408.7s)]
*  Anderson asked a direct question, would you be stronger on Israel than Trump? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=409.84s)]
*  And there was a seven-minute answer, but none of it related to the question he was asking. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=414.24s)]
*  If her goal was to close the deal, they're not sure she did that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=420.24s)]
*  I think that the word salad stuff gets on my nerves. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=425.4s)]
*  I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=428.2s)]
*  She focused a lot more on Donald Trump, I think it's fair to say, than she did on many [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=430.56s)]
*  specifics in terms of what she would do. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=437.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris participated in a one-person debate last night and she lost. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=440.56s)]
*  The word salad, the giggling, the non-answers, Donald Trump is Hitler and he's a fascist. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=446.16s)]
*  I mean it's just unbelievable we're at this point. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=452.24s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, he couldn't believe how bad Kamala's answers were. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=457.64s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=460.52s)]
*  She said during that town hall, she believes they've handled the border correctly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=461.88s)]
*  CNN pressed her on it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=465.72s)]
*  Would you have done anything different? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=467.06s)]
*  Do you regret anything? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=468.06s)]
*  And she said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=469.06s)]
*  Wait a minute, that she's handled it correctly? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=471.4s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=474.4s)]
*  She said that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  She said that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  We allowed 21 million people in. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  We allowed 13,099 murderers. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=480.64s)]
*  We allowed mental institutions from all over the world. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=483.92s)]
*  If she said that, look, she's a grossly incompetent person. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  And if she said that, they had the worst border in history. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=491.72s)]
*  Now as you can probably tell, almost no one on either side of the aisle thinks this Kamala [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=496.32s)]
*  Harris is a good candidate. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=502.64s)]
*  Make no mistake here, she would be an even worse president. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=505.04s)]
*  That's the scary part. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=508.16s)]
*  And her closing argument to you, the American people, is that Donald Trump is a fascist [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=509.16s)]
*  and a Nazi and that her surrogates are claiming that she's Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=513.88s)]
*  We have all heard these smears times and times again. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=520.24s)]
*  By the way, by Democrats historically, over the last eight years, they even compared John [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=525.04s)]
*  McCain, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan to Hitler. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=531.52s)]
*  And meanwhile, Trump's presidency was marked by, let's see, global peace, economic growth [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=535.72s)]
*  and stability by some measures, the best we'd had in 60 years, wealth income going up, lowest [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=540.64s)]
*  job for minorities in this country that had suffered under the Obama years and the Biden [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=547.84s)]
*  years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=553.64s)]
*  And Israel never had a better friend in the White House than Donald J. Trump. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=554.76s)]
*  Needless to say, Americans, they're just not buying Kamala's smear campaign. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=559.4s)]
*  As of tonight, Donald Trump is up in four separate national polls. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  National, he's up by three in The Wall Street Journal and up by two according to NBC. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=567.92s)]
*  He's up by two and over 50 percent according to Forbes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=573.0s)]
*  Rasmussen has him up by three. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=578.64s)]
*  Now, these polls looked a lot different four years ago, even though Trump lost by razor-thin [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=580.68s)]
*  margin. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=586.4s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal had him down by a whopping 10 points in 2020. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=587.4s)]
*  CNBC showed him down 10. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=591.96s)]
*  Rasmussen had Trump down by one. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=594.2s)]
*  And at this point in 2020, zero national polls showed Donald Trump in the lead. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=597.04s)]
*  In fact, the Real Clear Politics average showed Biden up by more than eight points at this [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=602.12s)]
*  point in 2020. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=607.16s)]
*  And now Harris is up by less than eight point and trending in the wrong direction. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=609.32s)]
*  And in the battleground states, Real Clear Politics, you see a similar pattern. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  At this point in 2020, Trump was down by nearly a point in Georgia, more than five in Wisconsin, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=618.3399999999999s)]
*  more than five in Pennsylvania, more than nine in Michigan, more than two points in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=623.54s)]
*  Arizona, more than five points in Nevada and more than a point in North Carolina. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=627.74s)]
*  Now, every one of those states has flipped, and Donald Trump is leading the Real Clear [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=633.18s)]
*  Politics average in the battleground states. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=638.14s)]
*  His favorability rating is also up four points. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=640.38s)]
*  Al-Kamala's favorability is more than seven points lower than Biden at this point in 2020. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=643.78s)]
*  But again, there's only one poll, and I say this with all seriousness, only one poll [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=650.06s)]
*  that matters, and that's election day. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=655.8199999999999s)]
*  And despite a dramatic shift in the polls and the betting markets, this race is still [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=659.38s)]
*  within the margin of error. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  I am asking everybody, if you care about the future of your country, you want to leave [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=665.78s)]
*  in a better position for your children and grandchildren, assume that your vote will [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=670.1s)]
*  decide the outcome of this race. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=674.22s)]
*  Don't forget that red wave in 2022, everybody was predicting it never materialized, did it? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=678.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are desperate, they are terrified of losing power, they hate Donald [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=685.02s)]
*  Trump, they will jump through hoops to turn out their base. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  The only way to counter this is to treat every single day like election day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=693.54s)]
*  In states all across the country, it's election day. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=698.9s)]
*  You can vote tomorrow morning. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=702.5s)]
*  And don't wait. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=705.02s)]
*  The polls, get out, vote, bank your vote. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  I talked to my friend Joe Bustardi, weatherbell.com. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=709.74s)]
*  He said, Sean, we may have as many as two more hurricanes this year. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=712.86s)]
*  What if it happens election week? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=715.9s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  This is not the system I want, system we got. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=718.48s)]
*  You want to change it, you got to win elections. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=720.84s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Wn56lIzrA&t=728.86s)]
