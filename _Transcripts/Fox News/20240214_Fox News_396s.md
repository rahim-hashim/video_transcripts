# Biden ‘broke’ our southern border: Sen. Tim Scott
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc)
*  And here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, first, let me start with the news on Mayorkas and his impeachment today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=2.72s)]
*  I would imagine with a partisan, left-wing, radical, Democratic party that probably is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=7.88s)]
*  not going to be convicted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=13.56s)]
*  However, he certainly has not been enforcing our nation's laws, and I think he deserved [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=15.16s)]
*  it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=19.56s)]
*  One thousand percent agree with you, Sean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=20.56s)]
*  Without any question at all, the courage of our House Republicans should be applauded. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=23.76s)]
*  The best way to get rid of Mayorkas is to fire Joe Biden. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=29.76s)]
*  It is time for the American people to be heard. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=33.96s)]
*  Our country, as you've just said, is experiencing a 10 million illegal immigrant invasion in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=37.28s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=43.28s)]
*  It is brought to us because Joe Biden broke our southern border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=44.28s)]
*  Joe Biden can fix it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=48.92s)]
*  Here's the one thing that we can see in common. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=50.6s)]
*  When Donald Trump was our president, there was no invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=53.56s)]
*  Our southern border was completely closed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=58.28s)]
*  Before Donald Trump, Obama, invasion in Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=60.92s)]
*  After Donald Trump, invasion in Ukraine. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=64.8s)]
*  What's the one common denominator for a safer world, a stronger America, a closed southern [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=68.12s)]
*  border, no crime on the streets of America, or less crime on the streets of America? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=75.08s)]
*  A strong American president. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=80.92s)]
*  Sean, it's time for us to realize we're better off with Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=83.56s)]
*  South Carolina will deliver a 25 point win for Donald Trump, and it is time for us to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=89.64s)]
*  get to Joe Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=95.8s)]
*  Let me ask you specifically, I mean, even Mitt Romney joining, you know, with the likes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=99.28s)]
*  of Joe Biden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=103.92s)]
*  Joe Biden said to reject Trump's dangerous un-American pro-Putin stance on Ukraine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=104.92s)]
*  That is not Donald Trump's position, nor is it, you know, Senate Republicans, the majority [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=111.08s)]
*  of which you included. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you don't want to offer aid and support when warranted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=119.28s)]
*  Even Nikki Haley, by the way, is now joined in as well, you know, warning Trump that this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=124.24s)]
*  will mean more war and slammed Donald Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=129.18s)]
*  Nikki Haley said this, of siding with the thug Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=133.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=137.76s)]
*  So, in other words, if you believe that securing our borders is far more important right now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  for our national security interests, if you believe that should be funded first, what, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=143.56s)]
*  that makes you a Putin puppet? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that the new definition? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=150.76s)]
*  Because that's bull. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=151.76s)]
*  That's hogwash. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Number one, it's called putting America first. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  America cannot be the city on the hill if we don't have borders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=158.72s)]
*  Our border needs a wall. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=162.84s)]
*  A wall, a physical impediment, would slow down and close to stop illegal immigrants [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  from walking across our southern border. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  And you hit the nail on the head, Sean. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Military-age men account for the vast majority of the folks coming across our border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  Thousands of Chinese nationals have been crossing our border. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=182.68s)]
*  And what has this administration done? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Blamed somebody besides the one person. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=189.68s)]
*  One person in America today could close our southern border. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=192.6s)]
*  He'd rather have the issue than solve the problem. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=196.16s)]
*  That's why we need a new president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=200.2s)]
*  Second thing I'll tell you, without any question, the remain in Mexico policy worked. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  Title 42 worked. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Having an asylum policy that requires you to seek asylum with a country contiguous with [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=211.24s)]
*  yours, it worked. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  Being a president with a backbone to stand up to dictators and murderers like Putin, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=218.2s)]
*  he did not do in Ukraine when President Trump was our president what he did with Obama and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=224.12s)]
*  what he's doing with Biden. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=230.64s)]
*  We should ask ourselves, why is that the case? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=233.24s)]
*  A strong American president makes a weak Putin. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=237.16s)]
*  A weak American president makes a strong Putin. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  This story has been playing out for darn near eight years, four before President Trump, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=244.72s)]
*  four after President Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=250.32s)]
*  You add that to the border and crime in the streets of America, and that's why African [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=251.6s)]
*  Americans, Hispanics, millennials are all turning to the GOP along with the rest of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=259.0s)]
*  our country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=264.48s)]
*  We're sick and tired, John, of being sick and tired. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=265.48s)]
*  Well, let me tell you something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=269.24s)]
*  For Joe Biden to say that Trump's and the Republicans' policies, if you don't fund [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=270.24s)]
*  Ukraine, we've already given them $75 billion, but Republicans that are standing firm, if [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=276.24s)]
*  they fund Ukraine, they give up any leverage, any hope of ever securing that border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=282.92s)]
*  And the likes of Mitt Romney and frankly, Nikki Haley, I'm shocked by her comments, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=289.0s)]
*  that you're supporting the thug Putin. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  Because they want the border secure first and they'd like to have a budget finished. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  We can't continue to live with, you know, record high budget deficits. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  Now that we're laying $34 trillion in debt on our children, Senator, we can't survive [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  as a country doing that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=314.92s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=318.56s)]
*  Here's the truth. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=319.56s)]
*  We will have spent $135 plus billion securing Ukraine's borders, but we won't spend $25 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=320.56s)]
*  billion, $30 billion to secure our border. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=329.68s)]
*  We will use the Israeli tragedy to fund Ukraine and not Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=332.92s)]
*  That's just wrong. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=340.44s)]
*  Fix our border, Joe Biden. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=342.36s)]
*  Fix our border. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=344.16s)]
*  Fix the border first. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=346.62s)]
*  Then we can discuss all these other things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=348.36s)]
*  Get your budget under control first, then we can take care, talk about other business. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=350.48s)]
*  See how much money we have left. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=355.32s)]
*  All right, Senator, if you get a call from Donald Trump and he asks you to be his VP, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  what would you say? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=362.16s)]
*  You know, I would say America first. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=365.22s)]
*  Only objective I have is to make sure President Donald Trump gets four more years, John. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=367.88s)]
*  You're never going to answer my question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=375.76s)]
*  I tried this way, that way, sideways, you know. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=377.52s)]
*  Anyway, we love having you on. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  Great to see you, Senator. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTYW-zP8Uc&t=382.59999999999997s)]
