# Tom Homan hits back at AOC: She is making this more difficult and dangerous
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y)
*  President Trump's border agenda is working. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The administration has the numbers now to back it up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  This morning, Border Czar Tom Homan announced that over the past 24 hours, only 229 illegals [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=5.94s)]
*  crossed over the entire southwest border, down from a high of more than 11,000 a day [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=12.34s)]
*  under Biden and Harris. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=18.54s)]
*  This afternoon, Homan announced that Interior ICE arrests have increased by a whopping 137 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=20.04s)]
*  percent under Donald Trump, while arrests of illegals with criminal convictions and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=26.98s)]
*  illegal alien gang members have more than doubled. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=32.42s)]
*  The border has become so much more secure under Donald Trump that a migrant shelter [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=35.3s)]
*  in San Diego is now closed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  They don't have any people going, after receiving no new arrivals since Donald Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=42.1s)]
*  took office. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=46.22s)]
*  Still, some of the left are doing everything they can do to stop Donald Trump from cleaning [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=47.22s)]
*  including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which earlier today Tom Homan said he finds [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=52.1s)]
*  quote disturbing, and Border Czar Tom Homan joins us now with more. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=58.94s)]
*  Tom, great to see you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=63.7s)]
*  You actually said about AOC, which I'm glad you took on, that let's pray she's not [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=65.42s)]
*  educating the next murderer of a young college nursing student on how to evade arrest by [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  ICE, and how many more young women have to be raped, murdered and burned alive until [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=76.9s)]
*  she wakes up? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=83.42s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=84.42s)]
*  No, it's a fact. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=85.42s)]
*  You know, she wants to go out and say she's teaching people the constitutional rights. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=86.42s)]
*  Yeah, you can call it that, but we all know what she's up to. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=91.78s)]
*  She wants to tell these people how to evade arrest, how to evade lights. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=94.66s)]
*  And we still got child predators we're looking for in New York in her district, people who [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=99.34s)]
*  convicted of child sex crimes, people who've been convicted of rape. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=102.98s)]
*  And she wants to say she's educating them on constitutional rights. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=107.3s)]
*  We're trying to enforce the laws that Congress enacted. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=109.78s)]
*  I believe she's a member of Congress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=112.94s)]
*  So if they're writing laws they don't want to enforce, I can think they got better things [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=114.82s)]
*  to do at the time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=118.02s)]
*  But as a member of Congress, you would think she'd want ICE to enforce the laws, the laws [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=119.02s)]
*  they enacted, that they appropriate us funding to do, and that's what we're trying to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=123.46s)]
*  do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=127.42s)]
*  And she's making it more difficult and more dangerous. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=128.42s)]
*  You know, I'm sure a free speech argument can be made, okay, she has every right to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=131.34s)]
*  say anything she wants. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=135.62s)]
*  When does it cross a line into aiding and abetting law breaking? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=137.7s)]
*  Would it have to have direct involvement by her in helping people to evade ICE? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=142.17999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly the question I posed to the deputy attorney general. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  I asked him to look into it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=153.82s)]
*  I said, you know, I know through my career someone steps in front of you, in between [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=155.18s)]
*  you and the person you're arresting and repeating, yeah, that's a violation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=159.58s)]
*  But at what point do you cross the line on saying you're educating people versus you're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=162.3s)]
*  teaching them how to evade ICE arrest? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=166.94s)]
*  So I've asked that question to the Department of Justice for clear guidance so I can share [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=168.34s)]
*  that with the officers of ICE. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=173.18s)]
*  So we're looking for that clear direction so we can start taking action on people who [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=175.26s)]
*  want to help educate these people to evade ICE. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=181.46s)]
*  So hopefully any day now we get that guidance sent out to the field. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  All right, 200â€”only 229 illegals entering the entire southwest border. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=188.7s)]
*  It was up to 11,000-plus a day under Biden and Harris. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=194.74s)]
*  Interior arrests by ICE up 137 percent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=199.3s)]
*  Deportations are at a record. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=203.66s)]
*  And even a San Diego illegal immigrant shelter has no new arrivals, so they closed, I would [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=207.74s)]
*  say, by any objective measure that that can only be defined as success. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  How quickly do you think it will be to get the known terrorists, murderers, rapists, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=220.62s)]
*  cartel members and drug dealers and gangs out of here? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=227.22s)]
*  First of all, you know, I got to salute President Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=233.38s)]
*  You know, he's been in office less than a month. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=235.5s)]
*  I said from day one on your show, Sean, he's a game changer. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  He proves to the American people every day why I consider him the greatest president [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=240.78s)]
*  in my lifetime. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=245.3s)]
*  No one's had success like this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  But I've said it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=248.3s)]
*  I'm happy the numbers are up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=249.3s)]
*  I'm happy with the results so far. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  I am not satisfied. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=252.34s)]
*  I will not be satisfied to every gang member, every illegal alien gang member, every illegal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  alien public safety threat and national security threat to eradicate from this country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=259.06s)]
*  So we're expanding the amount of teams now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=263.12s)]
*  We got Pam Bonnie suing the sanctuary cities. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=265.5s)]
*  We got Kristi Noemann now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=268.2s)]
*  She's been out with the board of patrols. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=269.9s)]
*  She's been on the ice. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=271.14s)]
*  She's done more enforcement operations in a week than my office has done in four years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=272.14s)]
*  Our team's coming together. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=276.3s)]
*  You got the architect, Steve Miller. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=277.3s)]
*  We're all working together to increase those numbers until we can eradicate once and for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=279.06s)]
*  all every illegal alien gang member and public safety threat and national security threat [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=283.54s)]
*  to this country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=287.74s)]
*  It's all on. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=288.74s)]
*  Our foot's on the gas and God bless President Trump for giving us the authorities, the resources [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=289.74s)]
*  do this job. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=294.42s)]
*  It's his vision that's making this all possible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=295.42s)]
*  What do you make of the New York Times headline? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump might have a case on birthright citizenship. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  And they rightly point out the Supreme Court held in 1898 a case where children born here [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=305.82000000000005s)]
*  to permanent residence are citizens. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  It has never held that children born to those illegally present have a right to birthright [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=324.18s)]
*  I would argue that they do not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=325.3s)]
*  I think the president is correct on that, and I'd like to see the Supreme Court take [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=327.1s)]
*  that up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=330.7s)]
*  Your take on it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=331.7s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=332.7s)]
*  You know, the left talks about that case. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=333.7s)]
*  They fail to mention, that's the wrong case, that those people are here illegally with [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=336.7s)]
*  the administration's approval. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  So they have never found a baby born to illegal aliens here in violation of law who entered [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=344.0s)]
*  the country illegally, which is a crime, and have a baby here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=349.96s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=353.08s)]
*  I don't think it's a clear-cut case. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=354.18s)]
*  I'm happy that the Supreme Court can take it on. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=355.62s)]
*  I think they're going to find that these children are U.S. citizens. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=357.94s)]
*  And that is a big driver of illegal immigration in this country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  One of the first things they do is have a child here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=364.3s)]
*  Even under Barack Obama, when Jay Johnson was the secretary, we did an operation looking [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=366.9s)]
*  for families that were already deported. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=371.06s)]
*  When we found them, 42 percent ordered were pregnant or had a U.S. citizen child. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=373.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=377.9s)]
*  Well, I want to thank you, because, you know, for four years, nobody in the last administration [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=378.9s)]
*  would talk to us. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=384.38s)]
*  And whenever Alejandro Mayorkas or Kamala or Joe, they just flat out talked about illegal [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=385.38s)]
*  immigration, they just flat out lied to the American people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  You're being straight up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=394.02s)]
*  You're being transparent. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=395.34s)]
*  You're literally telling the American people about progress on an updated basis, and we [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=399.26s)]
*  appreciate it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=403.5s)]
*  Thanks for your transparency. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=404.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y41jOW6Oj0Y&t=414.26s)]
