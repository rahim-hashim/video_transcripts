# Hannity: It's clear Kamala Harris now needs help two weeks before election day
**Fox News:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk)
*  Welcome to Hannity and in only 18 days you will elect a new president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=0.0s)]
*  Make no mistake with early voting now underway all across the country and the next two and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  a half weeks are critical for both campaigns. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=16.28s)]
*  By the way, as a public service, I put on my website, Hannity.com. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=18.92s)]
*  If you want to look up your state, your Commonwealth, how to register when early voting starts and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=22.84s)]
*  you can look it up there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=28.72s)]
*  And last night a massive unforced error from the Harris campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=30.32s)]
*  This has not been a good week for them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=33.48s)]
*  No presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984 has skipped out on the Al Smith dinner. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=35.36s)]
*  Now it's a charitable event benefiting Catholic charities where candidates get to poke fun [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=42.0s)]
*  at each other. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  But Kamala was nowhere to be found for a campaign supposedly built on joy, giggling and laughter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  It was kind of a weird move, especially since it's a very friendly room, usually New York [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=55.8s)]
*  City for Democrats, predominantly attended by liberals from New York City. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=60.96s)]
*  Kamala did send what was nothing but a short, cringeworthy, heavily produced, not funny [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=66.4s)]
*  edited video featuring a former SNL star that we won't force you to watch again. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, the dinner's host, comedian Jim Gaffigan, I mean, he just roasted Kamala's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=78.64s)]
*  absence and had some very interesting observations about the Democratic Party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=84.84s)]
*  They were funny. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=89.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=90.28s)]
*  This event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=91.28s)]
*  Twenty-two percent of Americans identify as Catholic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=102.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, why is Vice President Harris not here? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=107.8s)]
*  This is a room full of Catholics and Jews in New York City. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=112.26s)]
*  This is a layup for the Democratic nominee. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=119.62s)]
*  I mean, in her defense, I mean, she did find time to appear on The View, Howard Stern, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=124.26s)]
*  Colbert, and the longtime staple of campaigning, the Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats have been telling us Trump's reelection is a threat to democracy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=139.02s)]
*  In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup, ousted their democratically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=145.74s)]
*  elected incumbent, and installed Kamala Harris. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=152.94s)]
*  The media has begun discussing the phenomena of secret Trump voters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=156.46s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard about this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  People who publicly say they would never vote for Trump, but then when they go in the voting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=164.02s)]
*  booth, they do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=168.94s)]
*  It's a small group. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=169.94s)]
*  They're called the Biden family. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=171.34s)]
*  That was a great line. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=173.42s)]
*  Now, while Kamala was a no-show, many of the prominent Democrats were in attendance, including [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=176.22s)]
*  Chuckie Schumer, Kathy Hochul, who wanted all conservatives to get on a bus to move [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=180.82s)]
*  to Florida. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=185.28s)]
*  Okay, I took up your advice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=186.28s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg was there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  Even New York's Attorney General Letitia James was there, after of course weaponizing New [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=190.72s)]
*  York's court system and justice system against Donald Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=195.84s)]
*  And still, former President Trump was there, getting along pretty much with everybody. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=199.28s)]
*  He was hysterical. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  His jokes are going viral on social media. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=205.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Do something that's incredible, the Catholic Church, you're helping the poor, educating [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=213.64s)]
*  But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=221.76s)]
*  and she would have been here guaranteed. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=229.1s)]
*  I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=230.73999999999998s)]
*  I really hoped that she would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=235.98s)]
*  laugh. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  She laughs like crazy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  All polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  be. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=248.82s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  She hasn't. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=252.94s)]
*  Instead of attending tonight, she's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=253.94s)]
*  But Catholics, please don't be too insulted by Kamala's absence. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=262.7s)]
*  If the Democrats — he says, thank you very much, I appreciate it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=267.94s)]
*  If Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening, they would have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=273.54s)]
*  just sent Joe Biden. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=278.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself, but don't worry, he'll say that he was. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=279.62s)]
*  He's going to say he was. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=285.12s)]
*  We all know that Kamala likes to giggle incessantly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=287.12s)]
*  Why did she skip out on the dinner after all her campaign is desperately trying to make [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=293.04s)]
*  up ground after more than two weeks of horrible polls and horrible media appearances? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=297.14s)]
*  Let's look at it this way. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=302.88s)]
*  At this point in 2016, real clear politics average showed Hillary Clinton with a seven-point [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=303.88s)]
*  lead over Donald Trump, and she lost in 2020. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  Same average had Biden up by nearly nine, 8.9 percent, and that race was decided by [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=312.5s)]
*  a few thousand votes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=317.73999999999995s)]
*  But now Harris is barely holding on to a one-point lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden had substantial leads. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=325.46s)]
*  Now Donald Trump has the edge. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=328.44s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=330.38s)]
*  Look, anything, especially with Democrats and 51 former intel officials, anything can [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=331.88s)]
*  happen in 18 days, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=339.32s)]
*  But there is real panic on the left, including fake news CNN. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=341.52s)]
*  Look at this analysis. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=345.76s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=346.76s)]
*  If you believe that Donald Trump has somehow become less popular over time, let me change [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=349.2s)]
*  your mind about that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  In fact, he is more popular at this point in the campaign than he was at this point [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  in the 2020 campaign or the 2016 campaign. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=358.0s)]
*  The momentum of Kamala Harris has stalled, and I think they feel like they have to change [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=360.64s)]
*  something that's going on in their campaign because they were seeing a rise, and now it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=365.3s)]
*  has stalled out. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=368.86s)]
*  Look, she's still more popular than Trump, but look, Joe Biden was more popular than [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=369.86s)]
*  Trump, much more, and barely won, and Hillary Clinton was more popular than Donald Trump [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=373.46s)]
*  and lost. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  Let me take this moment and urge caution. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=379.34s)]
*  2022 was supposed to be a red wave. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=381.38s)]
*  It didn't work out that way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=383.3s)]
*  I'm telling all of my friends in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=385.36s)]
*  Arizona, Nevada, please assume that your vote will decide this election. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=392.36s)]
*  Take nothing here for granted. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  The Bernie Sanders are the top Democrats. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=399.48s)]
*  They are openly worried about the critical swing state. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=401.48s)]
*  For example, in this case, Pennsylvania, according to Politico, quote, Dems see warning signs [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=404.52s)]
*  for Harris with Latino men in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=410.64s)]
*  There are also tonight concerns about Michigan. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=413.92s)]
*  Quote, Harris went to Detroit to appeal to black voters. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=416.86s)]
*  They're still skeptical. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=421.3s)]
*  And here's David Brooks from the New York Times. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  Why the heck isn't she running away with this? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=426.06s)]
*  Well, let me answer that question. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=428.5s)]
*  For starters, everything about Kamala Harris and her campaign, it is fake, it is phony, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=430.1s)]
*  it is fraudulent. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=435.94s)]
*  She didn't get a single vote in the primary. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=437.42s)]
*  She was in democracy in peril and was installed by party elites. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=440.22s)]
*  Her website only recently published a policy section, which was basically a cut and paste [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=444.16s)]
*  from the Biden campaign and all of her own recently held radical beliefs that her stated [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=449.94000000000005s)]
*  positions and her own words that we have played over and over again have now all of a sudden [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=455.82000000000005s)]
*  changed according to anonymous campaign aides. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=460.76000000000005s)]
*  The moment she became her party's nominee and she now pretends that she had said nothing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=464.36s)]
*  about any of these things. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=470.32s)]
*  She had nothing to do with all of the catastrophes from the Biden-Harris administration, although [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=471.48s)]
*  she wouldn't do anything differently. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=477.32s)]
*  After bragging, she was the last person in the room for every major decision. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=479.40000000000003s)]

*  With a deep affection for the communist Chinese. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  And both Walls and Harris have long held radical, extreme, far-left beliefs, including support [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=495.52s)]
*  for ending capitalism in favor of New Green Deal radical Marxism. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=501.32s)]
*  At the very least, for everyone watching tonight, your taxes, they will go up in the first year [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=505.96s)]
*  of a Harris administration. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=511.28s)]
*  Your take-home pay will be less. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=513.14s)]

*  The only two policies that Kamala has detailed are her plans to massively increase government [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=518.72s)]
*  spending and simultaneously increase a number of different taxes, even unrealized capital [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=524.0400000000001s)]
*  gains and not just on the wealthy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=531.64s)]
*  And by the way, the border crisis, oh, that's going to get way worse. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=534.2s)]
*  Terrorists, gang members, cartels, convicted murderers, you know, the ones that killed [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=537.96s)]
*  dozens of Americans, rapists that raped dozens of Americans, hundreds of other Americans, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=542.96s)]
*  victims of violent crimes, all the human trafficking, drug trafficking, all the Americans killed, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=549.0s)]

*  If you think she did a bad job as borders are, just wait, God forbid, if she was ever president. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=559.44s)]
*  According to this analysis from the left-leaning Brookings Institution, a Harris presidency [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=565.0s)]
*  will allow another 12.3 million illegal immigrants into our country, and you can rest assured [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=570.24s)]
*  they'll be unvetted also. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=577.88s)]

*  That's their closing argument. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=589.7s)]
*  Unfortunately for her, she's not doing a very good job. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=591.2s)]
*  It is now more clear than ever why she got virtually no support from the 20, in the 2020 [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=594.68s)]
*  Democratic primary. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  I took on the big banks and fought to deliver $20 billion for middle-class families that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=603.0799999999999s)]

*  I stood up to veterans and stood up for, excuse me, stood up for veterans and students being [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=610.5s)]
*  scammed. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  I stood up to veterans. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, sorry, that was kind of like her Joe moment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  Anyone can have one. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=623.6s)]
*  Anyway, it's clear she needs help. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=624.6s)]
*  And now both Barack and Michelle Obama, they're hitting the campaign trail this week after, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=626.7600000000001s)]

*  men and accusing them of sexism, saying, quote, the brothers aren't coming out for Kamala. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, former President Trump was in the Bronx. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=645.8800000000001s)]
*  He was out of barbershop, just talking, listening to the current concerns of everyday Americans. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63kyrThVsk&t=648.2s)]
