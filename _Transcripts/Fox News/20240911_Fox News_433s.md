# JD Vance: ABC moderators did not do their job
**Fox News:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk)
*  Joining us now is 2024 Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Senator J.D. Vance. Senator, great to see you. How are you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=0.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=6.44s)]
*  You getting ready for your debate? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=6.94s)]
*  Yeah. Get a lot of pointers this evening. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=8.0s)]
*  Okay. All right. Let's get your overall take. I think the thing that's frustrating to me and a lot of people, number one, I think three on one was a little frustrating. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=11.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=19.0s)]
*  Number two, the topics that are so relevant, the radical positions that she's taken. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=20.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=25.5s)]
*  When I first interviewed you, the first interview you did when you were Vice President, when you announced to be the candidate, I asked you every hard question and you answered every one of them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=26.0s)]
*  And I kept you longer. It was supposed to be 10 minutes. I kept you 30. I was being very nice. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=38.0s)]
*  And all these radical positions she's taken, still no answers. We have not moved the ball an inch. It is frustrating. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=44.0s)]
*  It is frustrating. And the moderators, I think, did a terrible job of following up on that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=53.0s)]
*  But look, I think President Trump did a good job at reminding the American people that this is a person who wanted to ban fracking. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=56.5s)]
*  Here we are in Pennsylvania. She supported banning fracking. She supported defunding the police. She supported opening the border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=62.0s)]
*  And I think that though the moderators didn't do their job, I think President Trump did do his job in reminding the American people that she has taken a number of radical positions, that as he joked, she's run away from. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=68.0s)]
*  Now she's acting like Donald Trump. She's about to put on a MAGA hat because she realizes her radical- [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=77.5s)]
*  That was a pretty good line. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=82.0s)]
*  It was my favorite moment of the debate. But she is a radical who is trying to run towards Donald Trump's positions because she knows that's what's popular, but it's not what she actually believes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=83.5s)]
*  And I think that if you go to her performance, Sean, the most striking part of it is if you actually listen to what she said, it was platitude after platitude, after slogan, there was no substance. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=94.0s)]
*  How is she going to lower grocery prices for American citizens? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=105.0s)]
*  The Hearst cliché is everything that you want to say. And the bottom line is fundamental. I hate Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=108.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And also, look, both of them have records. That's what's different about this election, almost any other election in my lifetime. You have two people with a record. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=113.5s)]
*  Donald Trump is proud of his record. Kamala Harris is running away from her record because her record is higher grocery prices, homes that are unaffordable, a wide-open southern border, rising fentanyl deaths. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=122.0s)]
*  This is happening because of her failed leadership. And all we need to remind the American people of. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=133.0s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump did a great job of this tonight is the reason why these problems happen is because Kamala Harris failed to do her job. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=138.0s)]
*  You know, the thing is she's 50 days and prior to tonight, she does one interview, no press conferences. You're out there every day between you and President Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=144.0s)]
*  You're nearing what, 50 combined. And it's still a mystery. It's like the candidate protection program and the media keeps her in there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=154.0s)]
*  You know, I have all of these files, the Kamala files, the Walls files, them in their own words. This was all available to ABC tonight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=164.0s)]
*  You said this about fracking. You said this about drilling. You said this about sex change operations that taxpayers pay for for criminals and for illegal immigrants, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=172.0s)]
*  free housing, health care, education for illegal immigrants, the elimination of private health care. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=183.0s)]
*  All of these positions that she's taken, you know, and it's it's amazing that we're this far that we're this close to an election. We don't have these answers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=189.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. Well, she's running a campaign based on vibes and she's running. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=200.0s)]
*  What the hell is a vibe? Are we in the 60s? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=203.0s)]
*  It feels like it sometimes. I feel like watching Kamala Harris, like I've taken some psychedelics. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=207.0s)]
*  But look, she is a total disaster, Sean, and she runs away from a record. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=211.0s)]
*  This is the most striking thing is if you're the vice president, you've been in power for three and a half years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=216.0s)]
*  Is she running by saying, look what we did to lower your grocery prices? Look what we did to make the world more secure? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=221.0s)]
*  She can't. She can't because her record is one of failure. And we just have to remind the American people of this, Sean. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=226.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I think if you watch the debate, you're sitting at home, you're an undecided voter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=231.0s)]
*  What you saw is a person who repeats slogans instead of respecting you enough to treat you like an adult. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=235.0s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump gets criticized by this by the left for this, by the way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=241.0s)]
*  Donald Trump actually answers the questions because he respects the American people enough to treat them like citizens. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=245.0s)]
*  That's why he does every day debate. That's why he goes out there and talks to people because he thinks the ought to try to win the people's vote, not just have it given to you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=251.0s)]
*  She also told a lot of lies about Project 2025. Project 2025 is her radical agenda for her. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=260.0s)]
*  A national abortion ban. That wasn't true. She lied about her saying in 2000, no, I didn't say I'm for fracking. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=266.0s)]
*  Mandatory gun buyback. She said at the end of the debate, oh, no, I never said that. I'm a gun owner. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=274.0s)]
*  I'm like, that is exactly what you said. Yes, you did. It's on tape. We have it. We played it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=280.0s)]
*  That's right. Well, that's the entire trick here, right? Is the media is helping Kamala Harris run away from a record. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=286.0s)]
*  But we have her on tape saying all these things, Sean. And by the way, when she said that she supported a ban on fracking, then she changed her view in 2020. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=291.0s)]
*  That's another complete fabrication. She has never once changed her view that she wanted to ban fracking. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=299.0s)]
*  And you're an American sitting at home became the presumptive nominee. Well, that's right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=304.0s)]
*  She changed her mind in 2024, but not in 2020. So another complete fabrication. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=309.0s)]
*  But think about this. If you're a Pennsylvania energy worker or you're an American suffering from high utility and energy bills, Kamala Harris is telling you she wants to make you pay more. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=314.0s)]
*  And she wants to put these energy workers out of a job. It's a disgrace, but it's what she said in her own words. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=323.0s)]
*  And we've got a record of success to run on. We just have to keep on doing it. Let me ask you this because I think this is very important. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=329.0s)]
*  So with 56 days, but we have early voting. We're one week away. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=336.0s)]
*  Early voting starts here in Pennsylvania. You're spending a lot of time in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=341.0s)]
*  And one has to wonder, you know, to what extent has has her past statements of radical positions penetrated the consciousness of the American people? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=348.0s)]
*  Look, I think they've penetrated a little bit and it's our job over the remaining 56 days of the campaign. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=361.0s)]
*  You're right. Early voting starts in just a couple of weeks. It's our job to make it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=366.0s)]
*  We have to do this every single day. We have to remind the American people of what she said. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=370.0s)]
*  But this is not complicated. We just have to tell the truth. Kamala Harris wanted to ban fracking. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=375.0s)]
*  She wanted to defund the police. She said it all on video. We just have to remind people of what she said. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=380.0s)]
*  And by the way, Sean, it's not just reminding people what she said. It's reminding what Donald Trump did and has plans to do again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=385.0s)]
*  We had prosperity. We had peace. We had the American dream that started to feel alive again. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=392.0s)]
*  Thanks to Donald Trump's leadership, Sean, you know, I believe this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=398.0s)]
*  I think we've got the best workers, the best history and cultural traditions in the world. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=401.0s)]
*  We've got the best natural resources in the most beautiful country. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=405.0s)]
*  We have got failed leadership that is ruining our great inheritance as a country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=408.0s)]
*  We just need better leadership. It's that simple. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=413.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Senator. Good to see you. Appreciate it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=415.0s)]
*  We'll see you out on the campaign trail. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaDZwDKl0mk&t=418.0s)]
