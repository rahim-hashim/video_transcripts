# We won’t tame inflation if our spending problem grows: Larry Kudlow
**Fox News:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI)
*  Here with reaction, the host of Cudlow on the Fox Business Network, our good friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=0.0s)]
*  Larry Cudlow is back with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Larry, great to have you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=9.52s)]
*  Well, we've seen the inflation numbers, and June has come and gone, and the Fed can't [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=10.64s)]
*  lower rates yet again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=15.96s)]
*  I don't know if we'll even see any this year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=19.56s)]
*  We see now—I don't know why. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=22.12s)]
*  The last four months have been 3.2, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 percent inflation rate, GDP up year over [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=24.28s)]
*  year, so inflation has not tamed either. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=33.36s)]
*  Now I have three headlines today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=36.36s)]
*  Disappointing retail sales showing Biden inflation has taken its toll. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=38.32s)]
*  Retailers close over 3,000 stores because of Biden inflation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh, the administration inflated their job creation number by nearly 800,000 in 2023, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=50.080000000000005s)]
*  Larry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=56.84s)]
*  It sounds like they were lying to us, like they lied about the border and lied about never [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=57.96s)]
*  talking to Hunter or his brother or anybody. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=65.76s)]
*  So thanks for having me, Sean. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=68.76s)]
*  You know, you're right, the consumer seems to be sputtering. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=70.4s)]
*  Probably about half the country thinks they're in some kind of financial trouble. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=74.48s)]
*  I mean, over the course of Biden's entire term, the consumer price index has gone up [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=79.36s)]
*  about 20 percent, so that number's not changing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=87.12s)]
*  It's not getting any better. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=90.84s)]
*  Here's the best headline I can think of. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=92.68s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office just put out brand new numbers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=96.2s)]
*  We have a worsening debt crisis, and the cause of that crisis is spending. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=101.88s)]
*  Just in the past four months, it looks to me like spending has been re-estimated by [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=108.88s)]
*  two and a half trillion dollars higher. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  It's not a revenue problem, it's a spending problem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=119.48s)]
*  All these programs continue. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=122.8s)]
*  This is inflationary. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=124.88s)]
*  Debt is rising to roughly $50 trillion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=126.9s)]
*  This is according to the so-called nonpartisan CBO. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=130.9s)]
*  And as a share of the economy, it's about 120 percent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  Now, what does that mean? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=138.02s)]
*  Well, it means you're not going to tame inflation if you have a spending and debt problem that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=139.5s)]
*  keeps growing every four or five months. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=145.94s)]
*  And that's what people are looking at, and that's what they're feeling. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, real wages have continued to decline by about four and a half percent on a weekly [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=152.62s)]
*  basis. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=157.9s)]
*  Gasoline prices have come down, but they're still up about 45 percent from where they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=158.9s)]
*  were four years ago. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  Food prices, groceries are up 20 percent. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  But you can't stop inflation unless you curb spending. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=168.74s)]
*  And the Bidens have a spending problem. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=174.02s)]
*  I mean, these CBO numbers, we've looked at this on the business network. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=175.9s)]
*  Experts have looked at this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  This is completely unsustainable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=181.46s)]
*  This is the kind of numbers you'd think if you were in a depression. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=183.58s)]
*  But we are not in a depression, and all it is is going to continue the inflationary surge [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=186.94s)]
*  that we've had over the course of Biden's whole term. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=192.06s)]
*  Well, $56 trillion, they estimate that that will be our debt that we owe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=195.46s)]
*  And the interest on that debt is now about $1 trillion a year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=202.5s)]
*  We cannot sustain our economy with those numbers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=206.8s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=209.3s)]
*  Larry Kudlow. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=210.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ6LTuy3hI&t=211.3s)]
