# If I were a Democrat, I’d get rid of Biden and Harris: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs)
*  All right, here with more reaction, Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Kellyanne, I often say that Democrats circle the wagons, Republicans create circular [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=3.44s)]
*  firing squads, all right? So, this is what's going to be interesting to me this week when we have [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=9.6s)]
*  this impeachment inquiry vote. Will Democrats that maybe don't want Joe Biden to be their [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=14.96s)]
*  candidate in 2024, do you see them maybe using this as an opportunity to vote with Republicans [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=21.28s)]
*  to slowly push Joe off the ticket? It's possible, and I think it's going on with the mainstream [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=29.28s)]
*  media, and they're polling, Sean, why are CNN and NBC and other outlets that endorse Joe Biden, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=35.28s)]
*  don't want Donald Trump to be president again, running all these polls that show historically [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  high unfavorability rating for Joe Biden, high unfavorability rating when it's handling the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=47.36s)]
*  economy, energy, crime, the Middle East, Ukraine, the border, you name it. So I think these Democrats [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=51.92s)]
*  in Congress, either through their silence, which should be seen as acquiescence, or they're voting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=57.12s)]
*  with Republicans to move forward on an impeachment inquiry, are answering your question for you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=62.08s)]
*  They're taking the advice of people like me, who tell Democrats all the time, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=67.36s)]
*  if I were a Democrat, I'd roll the dice, get rid of Biden and Harris, and just take my chances [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=71.28s)]
*  because they're going to ruin the future of the party. You know, Sean, if there's nothing to see [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=76.88s)]
*  there, if there's truly no evidence, the Democrats should welcome the inquiry. Maybe it would help Joe [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=81.12s)]
*  Biden in the polls. They'd see him as a victim. They'd see him as put upon. They can say it's a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=85.92s)]
*  partisan witch hunt. They know Joe Biden has very little, if any, political currency going into this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=89.52s)]
*  impeachment inquiry, and they know this is a White House that has stonewalled and is noncompliant [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=95.52s)]
*  with the simplest of subpoenas. That's why I think you're going to see Democrats come forward. They [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=101.44s)]
*  should come forward, Sean, and they should say with dignity and transparency, I want the White [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=105.84s)]
*  House to at least comply with an inquiry. Sean, we lived through conclusions in search of evidence [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=111.28s)]
*  all during the Trump candidacy presidency and frankly post presidency. There is Russia collusion. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  We will find it sometime somewhere. They still haven't. Years later, we have more Russia [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=124.08s)]
*  collusion, more Ukrainian collusion with the Bidens than we do with Trump. So if they don't fear, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=128.72s)]
*  if there's nothing to fear, go for it. I think Biden is in such deep trouble, though, in all this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=134.4s)]
*  polling for the Wall Street Journal poll to have Trump beating him for the first time in its poll, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=140.24s)]
*  for Trump to be beating Biden on 22 percent, by 22 percent on people say the economy is the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=145.12s)]
*  number one issue to them. That spans all demographic and geographic groups. And if you think it's not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  so bad for Biden, watch him take Hillary Clinton with him on the campaign trail. That will really [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  be the death knell. She is a two-time loser, election denier, the second most popular person [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  in a two-person household every day when she wakes up. And in twenty twenty two, one or two [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=168.08s)]
*  candidates wanted her with one of her with them. Kathy Hochul in New York, I think he wants Barack [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Obama by his side. He's going to get the cheap version of that Hillary Clinton. All right. Let [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  me ask you this. So as we go into twenty twenty four, you know, the old saying, are you better off [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=184.4s)]
*  than you were four years ago? That will be a question next year. I honestly and I mean, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  objective as I can, I cannot think of a single policy success, any policy that has benefited [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=195.12s)]
*  the American people, Joe Biden. That's number one. Number two, if you look at Joe Biden and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=202.32s)]
*  and I think this is interesting, I can't think of a single public event, Kellyanne, not one [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  where he has not had some cognitive incident. Either he mumbles, he bumbles, he fumbles. You [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=214.72s)]
*  can't understand him. He's incomprehensible or something like what happened and I'll read it to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=220.72s)]
*  you. I'll put it up on the screen again for Betum because you can't make this up in case you missed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=227.76s)]
*  it. You know, over a billion, three hundred million, trillion, three hundred million dollars. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=232.72s)]
*  OK, I don't have an abacus like Joe does. I actually have a real computer. You know, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=241.68s)]
*  it's actually on my phone, a calculator. And all right. How does he get away with that day [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=247.04s)]
*  after day, week after week, and nobody in the media seems to care? By the way, he doesn't. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=253.12s)]
*  Who cares? Hey, Sean, who cares what the media thinks and doesn't covers and lies about when [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  the people themselves are telling pollsters right, left and center, this guy's got to go. They have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=262.64s)]
*  no faith in him whatsoever. There's not a single issue where Joe Biden is more approved than [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=268.24s)]
*  disapproved in his handling on the issue. You name the issue. And these are public events where he [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=273.28s)]
*  has teleprompters. You're showing it right there. He's reading from a teleprompter and he's making [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=277.44s)]
*  these flubs and gaffes. Can you see him in a 90 minute debate with Donald Trump when he is asked, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=282.56s)]
*  why do you go to East Palestine, Ohio? Why did you kill those Keystone pipeline jobs on day one and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=287.44s)]
*  punish forty two thousand innocent Americans who either were or could be working in those jobs? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  Why did you chaotically pull out of Afghanistan in August of 2021? Why did you do this, that and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=297.92s)]
*  the other in Ukraine, in the Middle East, at the border? Why are you letting nine million people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=303.76s)]
*  through? How in the world is he going to have the agility and the acuity and the ability to actually [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  do that without a teleprompter on his own defending his record? I don't think he's getting away with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=313.44s)]
*  a thing. I think the Democratic Party long term is in a very bad place by just hanging on to Biden [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  and to Harris. Sean, what you see in the polls now, it's how people are going to vote a year [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=323.92s)]
*  from now. I promise you a less than a year from now because things are going to change. They're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=327.92s)]
*  worried about their own economic anxiety. They stopped worrying about his acuity and his health. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  They're worried about their own economic wherewithal. Last point, these new CNN polls, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  nine, nine percent of people under the age of 45 in Michigan and Georgia said that Joe Biden is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  the kind of president that aligns with their policy positions. Over a billion, over a billion, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=347.36s)]
*  300 million, trillion, 300 million dollars. Dr. Seuss lives and breathes in Joe Biden. I mean, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=353.12s)]
*  I think he'd get a big applause in kindergarten for knowing all those big words. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=360.24s)]
*  We all love yellow school bus. You got it. We love having you. Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvm00d0jTs&t=364.72s)]
