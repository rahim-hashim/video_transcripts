# House Speaker Mike Johnson: Republicans can't waste any time
**Fox News:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4)
*  Joining us now with more, the man himself, Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you for joining me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=5.44s)]
*  Hey, Kellyanne, happy new year and congrats to Sean and Ainsley. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=7.8s)]
*  That's exciting news. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=12.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=13.8s)]
*  Sir, so to become speaker again or to remain speaker, it's not a matter of biology or chemistry [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=14.8s)]
*  or art. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=20.04s)]
*  It's math. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=21.04s)]
*  Do you have the votes? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=22.04s)]
*  I think we do, Kellyanne. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=25.04s)]
*  And I'm really humbled and honored to have President Trump's endorsement for speaker [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=26.08s)]
*  again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  He and I work so well together, so closely together, and we have a lot of big things [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=34.2s)]
*  He recognizes that what we need right now, I think my colleagues recognize this as well, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=35.2s)]
*  is a proven fighter and a true MAGA conservative, but also someone who can work with every single [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=39.48s)]
*  member of our very diverse House GOP so that we can get President Trump's priorities over [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=45.4s)]
*  the line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=50.64s)]
*  That's what's ahead of us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=51.64s)]
*  I think this could be the most consequential presidency and Congress of the modern era [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=53.24s)]
*  because we have to fix everything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=56.92s)]
*  It has to start on day one, so we can't waste any time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=58.6s)]
*  And Mr. Speaker, in 2017, I went to the White House, and on day one, I noticed we had a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=61.4s)]
*  35-seat majority for Republicans in the House of Representatives, and yet even with plus [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=66.36s)]
*  35, you have a plus a handful, it was so difficult to repeal and replace Obamacare to get infrastructure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=72.16s)]
*  passed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  The American Jobs Act got signed into law in December, not March, because there was [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  some resistance in the ranks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like you have a handle on unifying a very diverse coalition. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=85.0s)]
*  What do you think the first three, four major priorities for the America First agenda could [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=91.16s)]
*  actually pass the House and go to the Republican Senate majority first couple weeks? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=95.24s)]
*  Well we have to do a number of things simultaneously. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  The budget reconciliation process is going to be the key of the first 100 days because [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=105.36s)]
*  in order to fix all the things that we've got to fix, we have to squeeze a lot of policy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=110.28s)]
*  changes through that process. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=114.8s)]
*  And not to get too deep in the weeds, but why that's so valuable is it avoids the 60-vote [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=117.5s)]
*  threshold that's necessary in the Senate under normal circumstances. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=121.8s)]
*  So we can move the Republican agenda, the American First agenda, through reconciliation, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=125.42s)]
*  but it takes a lot of coordination, planning and executing those plans with precision to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=130.24s)]
*  get that done. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  And so you'll see a lot of energy on that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  We're going to fix the border. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  We are going to get the economy humming again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  We are going to restore our stature on the world stage, get our energy policy fixed, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=141.28s)]
*  make sure that we don't have the largest tax cut in U.S. history imposed upon the American [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=145.84s)]
*  people at the end of next year when the tax cuts from the Trump era expire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=150.24s)]
*  So a lot of big agenda items on the table. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  And you're right, it's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=157.92s)]
*  Republicans to get it done, but I'm absolutely convinced that we can. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=161.76s)]
*  We're going to stay unified and we are going to get this job done. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  One of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard said about President Trump is that he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=168.92s)]
*  wants to surround himself with yes men and yes women. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=173.0s)]
*  I know that's not true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  Obsequiousness bores him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  He likes for people to give him a multitude of opinions, and of course he makes the final [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  decision. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  sweeping victory, all seven swing states, a popular vote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=185.12s)]
*  The country looks very red. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=189.24s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I think that's an important point moving forward. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=191.04s)]
*  The fealty, the loyalty is not to a man or even a political party, it's to the agenda. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=194.44s)]
*  And so for some of those holdouts, for Thomas Massie, who said he's not going to vote for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=199.04s)]
*  you, for Victoria Sparks, who gave you a list of demands today, for maybe Chip Roy, what [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  do you say about the America First agenda to them that they can glom onto rather than [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  be, I think, disruptors and interrupters to getting a lot of this great policy through [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=212.88s)]
*  that Americans are relying upon? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=216.84s)]
*  Well, the three members you just named are all good friends of mine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=219.28s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time talking with each of them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=223.44s)]
*  I spoke with Victoria for about 45 minutes, about an hour and a half ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=226.28s)]
*  I spoke with President Trump most recently, about 15 minutes ago. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  We're in constant conversation about all this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that those members and all of them want to be a part of these solutions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=235.56s)]
*  They made big promises to their constituents in this campaign cycle, and we've got to deliver [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=239.5s)]
*  upon them now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=244.72s)]
*  It's the media and the left that wants to divide us and distract us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=245.88s)]
*  We can't fall into that trap. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=249.52s)]
*  We've got to stay united. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=250.74s)]
*  And if we do, we can bring about this America First agenda quickly and deliver for the American [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=251.74s)]
*  people so they see results very early in the year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=257.7s)]
*  We have a lot on our plate, but I'm confident we're going to be able to get it done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=260.3s)]
*  And I'm really grateful for the support across the spectrum in the House GOP and all the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=263.42s)]
*  endorsements that have come forward. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=268.46s)]
*  We're going to unite and get this thing done for the American people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=270.29999999999995s)]
*  And you got the biggest endorsement of all in President-elect Trump because he's signaling [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  to everyone this is the way that we don't interrupt the momentum that's there and that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  the policy agenda piece by piece gets implemented. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=280.34s)]
*  You put it on his desk, he'll sign it, and it'll become law. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=282.9s)]
*  Many more people will feel the relief. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=286.46s)]
*  So Mr. Speaker, in terms of energy independence, you mentioned that, in terms of border security, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  tax cut and jobs act. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=293.98s)]
*  If those things don't happen, what do you see for the country? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=295.7s)]
*  In other words, paint a bleak picture. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=300.06s)]
*  These things don't pass and people say it really doesn't matter who the president is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=302.82s)]
*  Why does it matter if we have all three chambers now, if we have the House, the Senate and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=306.46s)]
*  the White House? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=309.98s)]
*  Well, this is a great blessing for America to have unified government. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=311.7s)]
*  When you have Republicans in charge of all three of those levers of power, we'll actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=315.96s)]
*  be able to move this agenda. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=320.06s)]
*  Trump spoke to the American people directly and what he said resonated with them because [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=321.74s)]
*  it was common sense. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=327.86s)]
*  It's restoring America's greatness. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=329.42s)]
*  It's things that all of us agree with. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=331.14s)]
*  And you saw a demographic shift in the election cycle, Kellyanne. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=333.46s)]
*  Large numbers, large groups of people who had not traditionally been with the Republican [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=337.54s)]
*  Party, at least not in a long time, because they believe in those ideas and those principles. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  So now's our opportunity to do it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=345.94s)]
*  If we don't, then the country that we know and love will not long survive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  This truly is kind of an existential moment for the country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=354.02s)]
*  People recognize that in the election cycle. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  And they gave President Donald J. Trump 77 million votes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  It was a landslide, a mandate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=363.18s)]
*  And we have to execute upon that mandate now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=365.14s)]
*  Now's our time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  The Republican Party, the America First movement is growing and with that comes some growing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=368.5s)]
*  pains, no doubt. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=372.14s)]
*  You mentioned a couple of key constituencies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=373.14s)]
*  The media, maybe they want to break us apart. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=375.14s)]
*  Maybe they want to divide and conquer. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=379.06s)]
*  Do you see any John Fettermans in the House of Representatives, those Democratic elected [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=380.94s)]
*  officials like Senator John Fetterman, freshman member of Pennsylvania, who basically is making [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=384.78s)]
*  joyful noises about the America First agenda, giving President Trump a chance, recognizing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=390.5s)]
*  that President Trump won his state of Pennsylvania handily this time? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=394.62s)]
*  Any Democrats you think you could start peeling off to make a difference for their constituents [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=398.44s)]
*  and put partisan politics aside? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=403.04s)]
*  Yeah, look, I hope so. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=405.04s)]
*  I mean, our arms are open to anyone who wants to help us save the country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=408.08s)]
*  And these are policies, again, that are common sense, that the people favor. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=412.36s)]
*  And I think a lot of our Democrat colleagues see that, particularly those who are elected [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=416.12s)]
*  in close districts and swing districts. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=419.88s)]
*  I think they want to be a part of these solutions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=422.24s)]
*  And when you're in an era of small majorities, which we have now, I mean, we'll have a one [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=424.12s)]
*  or two, three seat majority at any given time this year, we're certainly open to bipartisanship [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=428.48s)]
*  and having Democrats come along to help us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=434.24s)]
*  I think we are going to attract some of those. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=436.32s)]
*  I think some of them may even be wondering whether or not they should switch parties [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=438.56s)]
*  right now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=442.6s)]
*  So this is a great time for the Republican Party, not a great time to be a Democrat. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=443.6s)]
*  They're in total disarray. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=447.6s)]
*  They have no leader and they have no vision going forward. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=448.6s)]
*  So this is a real moment for us and we're going to deliver. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, thank you so much. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  All the best. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=456.24s)]
*  Happy and healthy New Year to Kelly and you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=457.24s)]
*  And since I'm a Philadelphia Eagles fan, I have a feeling I'll be in New Orleans for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=458.72s)]
*  the Super Bowl rooting on my team. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=461.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=464.12s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=465.36s)]
*  We'll see you on January 3rd. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtswaNJtPI4&t=466.36s)]
