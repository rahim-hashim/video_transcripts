# Mike Huckabee: Kamala Harris doesn’t want people to find this out
**Fox News:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE)
*  All right, Peter, thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, co-host of the hit show, The Five, Jessica Tarlov, former Arkansas Governor [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=1.54s)]
*  Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=6.2s)]
*  Jessica, I hope you heard my monologue. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=7.2s)]
*  I went through— [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=10.16s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=11.16s)]
*  —I won't repeat everything, but her position is on immigration, on law and order, defund, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=12.16s)]
*  dismantle, you know, no bail laws, and her position on energy, no fracking, no drilling, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=17.8s)]
*  her position bragging about Bidenomics. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=24.04s)]
*  She's not bragging about it anymore. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=25.84s)]
*  Now she wants price controls. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=27.6s)]
*  And then, of course, there are foreign policy disasters and, you know, don't say radical [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=33.8s)]
*  Why are they running so hard, your party running so hard from who they really are and who they've [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=35.4s)]
*  been? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=41.04s)]
*  Because I've never seen this before. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=42.04s)]
*  Well, the Kamala Harris of 2019 wouldn't win this election, but the Kamala Harris of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  2024, it looks like she has a very real shot at it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=49.16s)]
*  And I understand that we're still underdogs, and she acknowledged that today when she was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=52.32s)]
*  out doing her Pennsylvania bus tour. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=55.28s)]
*  Yeah, but, Jessica, I don't mean to interrupt. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=57.2s)]
*  I'm trying to get to what are her true beliefs, because she only made these changes as soon [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=58.32s)]
*  as she became the presumptive nominee. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=72.12s)]
*  That tells me she's doing it for political expediency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=74.44s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=77.12s)]
*  No, it's not true that she's done that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=79.12s)]
*  She has been President Biden's vice president for the last four years, three and a half [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=81.2s)]
*  And the policies that they have enacted, and you take this for better or for worse, are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=86.48s)]
*  policies that she's going to have to account for. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=90.64s)]
*  But none of those policies are banning fracking. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  They were actually more drill baby drill than Donald Trump was. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  13.4 million barrels of crude oil per day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=98.36s)]
*  Why was she bragging about binomics? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=101.2s)]
*  Why was she saying, you know, that the border's secure? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=103.76s)]
*  Why was she saying inflation's transitory? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=107.68s)]
*  Why was she lying to us? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  She wasn't lying to you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=112.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris has made it clear that there is a lot about binomics, as it was called, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  that there is to be proud of, looking at the GDP rate, looking at the fact that we have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  lowered inflation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=122.0s)]
*  We're leading the world, actually, in how fast we've recovered. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=123.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean the job is done, but it's a lot of progress. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  The jobs record better than Donald Trump's. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=128.28s)]
*  The number of people who have gotten insurance under the Biden-Harris administration, these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  are all part of binomics. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=133.84s)]
*  She wants to eliminate private insurance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=135.4s)]
*  No, she doesn't. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  She wants to eliminate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  She wants universal health care. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  It is — you will meet a lot of people who, in their heart, want universal health care, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=142.04s)]
*  but understand — [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  That was her. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  That was her. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  That was her. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  So what in 2019? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Have you ever heard her as vice president say — [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't Joe Biden. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't the Biden policy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  It was her policy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry — [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  That's what she wanted. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  She said it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  In 2019 — [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  I didn't say it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  I understand. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  I watched the clip. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  I understand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  But if you talk to her today about it, there is no way that she is going to say that she [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  wants to eliminate private insurance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=169.12s)]
*  There's just no way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=171.12s)]
*  That's why there's an expanding — [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=172.12s)]
*  So she'll say — let's be honest. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=173.12s)]
*  — Medicaid — [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=174.12s)]
*  All right, let me go to Mike Huckabee. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=175.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=176.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=177.12s)]
*  She will say and do anything she needs to say or do to become president. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=178.12s)]
*  That's the only way to interpret it, Governor Huckabee. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  And we're really looking at a con artist, and we're looking at a smoke and mirror campaign [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  and a phony that is trying to manipulate the American people with the help of a very complying, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=188.36s)]
*  complicit media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just tell you that Peter Ducey has a hotel room in Chicago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=196.32s)]
*  He registered under the name of Sean Hannity. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=202.56s)]
*  So just be careful. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=205.16s)]
*  Secondly, let's be clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=207.16s)]
*  There's going to be a special ceremony on Wednesday night at the DNC. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  An Emmy will be presented to Kamala Harris for the best performance of a person who has [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  changed all of her positions conveniently in order to be acceptable as a candidate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  The fact is, you outlined all of those policies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=225.6s)]
*  But Kamala Harris is one of those people that she says, I've got principles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=229.24s)]
*  And if you don't like the ones I've got, I'll find some more. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's what she's done. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=237.56s)]
*  And let's not kid ourselves. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=239.36s)]
*  This is a person whose policies that she has been touting for all her political life are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=240.68s)]
*  totally unacceptable to the American people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  And her best shot at winning is for us to never find out that she was for higher taxes, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  open borders, open insanity when it comes to regulating businesses and making sure that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  we fund the bail for people who have violently burned down cities. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=262.64s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  She stands for that stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=269.44s)]
*  Now, she may claim she doesn't now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=271.0s)]
*  And if I were her, I wouldn't want to claim for it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=276.06s)]
*  I hope this convention is peaceful. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=277.14s)]
*  I really do, Sean, because it's better for the country if it doesn't turn into 1968, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=279.34s)]
*  which I remember very well. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=284.58s)]
*  But the Democrats, they got themselves a problem. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=286.6s)]
*  And the problem is, they haven't gone far enough to the left for the crazies that are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=289.2s)]
*  going to be out there demanding stuff that is totally insane. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=293.22s)]
*  And they won't go after these people hard if they're involved. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=299.42s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=302.42s)]
*  I pray for peace. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=303.86s)]
*  I don't want anything to happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=304.94s)]
*  However, just like they lied in the summer of 2020, they're mostly peaceful. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=306.62s)]
*  Let's open up the windows and smell burning rubber. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=311.3s)]
*  Let's support a bail fund for the people burning down cities and hurting cops and even killing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=313.82s)]
*  people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  It's definitely Jessica, your week, not mine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=322.58s)]
*  I'll see you in Chicago. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=325.18s)]
*  Where else? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXPL14SJ7jE&t=336.62s)]
