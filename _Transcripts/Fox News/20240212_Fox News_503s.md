# Sean Hannity: It’s ‘obvious’ Biden’s not fit to be your president
**Fox News:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE)
*  Also tonight, after Joe Biden's latest string of bizarre gaffes and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=0.0s)]
*  highlighting problems with his age and memory, well, Democrats and the left, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=4.0s)]
*  they are waking up to what we have been telling you on this program for years now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=9.52s)]
*  And that is the White House is a massive problem with Joe Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=13.92s)]
*  It's an age problem and it's bad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=17.84s)]
*  And it's now obvious that Joe Biden is not fit to serve as your president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Last night, while exiting Marine One, well, here we go again, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Biden appeared to hit his head. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=27.52s)]
*  This comes as a new ABC poll shows that a staggering, look at this, nearly nine [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=29.88s)]
*  in 10 Americans, 86% of you, the American people think, rightly so in my view, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=35.04s)]
*  that Biden is too old to serve another term in the White House. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=41.68s)]
*  That'd be five more years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=44.96s)]
*  Now with the country so divided, when was the last time 86% of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=46.8s)]
*  Americans agreed on anything? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=51.04s)]
*  Most people can't agree on the time of day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=52.92s)]
*  And instead of worrying about her husband's mental health, well, Jill Biden [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=55.32s)]
*  is doubling down with the excuses. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  And last week's damning special council report with Robert Herd noted that Biden [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  couldn't even remember within several years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=67.16s)]
*  This is sad. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=70.16s)]
*  This is tragic when his son, Bo, died. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=70.92s)]
*  But this weekend, Jill Biden defended Joe's inability to remember writing in a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=73.76s)]
*  campaign email quote, well, if you've experienced a loss like that, you know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=78.92s)]
*  that you don't measure it in years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  You measure it in grief. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=85.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=87.24s)]
*  And according to an upcoming book, she allegedly berated staff for not stopping [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=87.6s)]
*  a disastrous press conference that Joe held in 2022. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  And if that was bad last week, well, it had to be Joe Biden's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=97.08s)]
*  worst week of his presidency. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=100.8s)]
*  It should not be a surprise that Jill is rushing to cover for his growing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  struggles after all, she did have ample practice doing so, reportedly now having [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=106.88s)]
*  to show Joe how to walk off stage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=112.6s)]
*  You can't remember to exit stage left stage, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  You know, he could have used, uh, couldn't have, couldn't have done it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=117.52s)]
*  without our help, frankly, he gets lost in his own white house, by the way, he [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  got lost delivering remarks with the king of Jordan can't make this up, but it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=129.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=129.72s)]
*  Your majesty over to you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=131.48s)]
*  Mr. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=142.6s)]
*  Sorry, Mr. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=145.72s)]
*  President. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Uh, thank you for your gracious hospitality. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=149.32s)]
*  I think I'll go to this side. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=154.0s)]
*  No, that side. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=155.16s)]
*  I couldn't remember. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=156.0s)]
*  Anyway, last week's special counsel report is simply pointing out the obvious. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=157.32s)]
*  Joe Biden has been and continues to struggle. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=161.2s)]
*  It's not going to get better from here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=164.16s)]
*  Remember, this is a guy who has repeatedly now recall conversations with a lot of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=166.44s)]
*  dead people, French president meter on German chancellor, helmet, coal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=171.32s)]
*  Remember the Amtrak conductor that had long since passed or introducing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=176.32s)]
*  congresswoman Jackie Wolorski after she had passed away or Margaret Thatcher. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=181.08s)]
*  There's a lot of conversations with a lot of dead people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=185.64s)]
*  Yesterday, his attorney, Bob Bauer attacked a special counsel's report. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=188.28s)]
*  He was on CBS has faced the nation, but then waffled on whether or not he wanted [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=192.24s)]
*  the full interview, the transcripts to be released. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=197.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=199.36s)]
*  So along with the legal conclusion comes this flood of characterizations, factual [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  misstatement, pejorative comments about the president that are inconsistent with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=206.36s)]
*  DOJ policy and norms. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=212.52s)]
*  And that is you see over the last 48 hours have been widely criticized by legal [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=214.36s)]
*  experts. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=218.4s)]
*  This is not what prosecutors do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=219.36s)]
*  It is shoddy work product. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=220.8s)]
*  Would you recommend that these be made public if they indeed back up your [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=222.28s)]
*  personal record? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=225.84s)]
*  Again, there's a process underway. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=226.52s)]
*  I'm not a specialist in that process, and so I really have to defer to those who [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=227.96s)]
*  have to work through those issues. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  This would not be something you have to defer to anybody on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=234.56s)]
*  If what you're saying is true, then let's see the transcripts of that videotape. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=236.96s)]
*  Let's see that too soon. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=241.0s)]
*  These transcripts may soon be released to Congress and frankly, you, the public, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=242.84s)]
*  you have a right to get the transcripts and see the video and breaking tonight, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=247.68s)]
*  the House impeachment inquiry managers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  They have just subpoenaed the transcripts of the full interviews given the DOJ until [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=254.16s)]
*  5 p.m. next Monday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=258.8s)]
*  That would be a week from today to comply. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, things have gotten so bad that even the media mob, they are coming to terms [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  with truth and reality. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=267.64s)]
*  On Friday, New York Times, their editorial board published a column highlighting, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=269.0s)]
*  quote, the challenges of an aging president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  While another New York Times op-ed this weekend was titled, quote, The question is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=276.12s)]
*  not if Biden should step aside, it's how. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  Even Maureen Dowd is now calling on Biden's team to quit being in denial and writing, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=284.36s)]
*  quote, ditch the stealth about health. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=289.44s)]
*  She's not wrong. Politico echoing that alarm, saying the Democrats, they may need to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  turn to Plan B and replace Biden on their ticket. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Even Biden's staunchest defenders on the left, they are sounding the alarm. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=304.68s)]
*  This is a problem for the president. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=306.52s)]
*  Anderson, the most damaging things that can happen in politics are things that reinforce [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=308.56s)]
*  a meme that's out there that is hurting you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=313.56s)]
*  And the central meme that is hurting the president is this issue of age. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=316.2s)]
*  Look, I'm a Biden supporter. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=320.52s)]
*  I slept like a baby last night. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=322.08s)]
*  I woke up every two hours crying and what the bet. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=324.08s)]
*  This is this is terrible for Democrats and anybody with a functioning brain knows [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=327.12s)]
*  that. If Biden's hubris is such that he doesn't understand the best interests of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=331.6s)]
*  his party and more important his country, then he has to be shown the door. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=337.24s)]
*  Period. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=341.92s)]
*  You don't accept a Super Bowl interview. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=343.36s)]
*  You're about to know polling averages you three points down in a two way. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=345.8s)]
*  It's the biggest television audience, not even close. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  And you get a chance to do a 20, 25 minute interview on that day and you don't do [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=355.12s)]
*  it. That's a kind of sign that the staff or yourself doesn't have much confidence [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=361.44s)]
*  in you. There's no other way to read this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=366.76s)]
*  All right, Carvel, Bagala, Van Jones, David Axelrod, Maureen Dowd. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  Those are a lot of prominent names within liberal Democratic circles. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=376.48s)]
*  Remember last month, it was Van Jones himself who said that if he were Biden, I'd [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=380.92s)]
*  hide. I'd stay hidden. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=385.44s)]
*  And Joe and his handlers might want to take that advice. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=387.4s)]
*  That's probably the only advice they can give him. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=389.8s)]
*  Let other people campaign for him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=391.52s)]
*  Hide him in the basement again. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=393.12s)]
*  It worked once. Let's see if it can work a second time. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=394.6s)]
*  Not everyone seems concerned, though, over his age. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  Hillary Clinton tried to downplay the issue in an interview last week. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=399.92s)]
*  Let's look at this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=403.56s)]
*  You know, I talk to people in the White House all the time and, you know, they know [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=405.12s)]
*  it's an issue. But as I like to say, look, it's a legitimate issue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=409.2s)]
*  It's a legitimate issue for Trump, who's only three years younger. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzaPjL_KNXE&t=412.6s)]
