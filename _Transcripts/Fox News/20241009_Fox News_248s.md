# Sen. Josh Hawley: The Secret Service doesnâ€™t want the public to know the truth
**Fox News:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU)
*  And tonight, another whistleblower has come forward to Senator Josh Hawley, revealing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=0.0s)]
*  disturbing allegations about the Secret Service in a letter to Acting Director Roe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=4.5s)]
*  Hawley wrote that a Secret Service whistleblower has alleged the agency blocked multiple DHS [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=9.4s)]
*  auditors from accessing certain Trump campaign events, and that they did this because former [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=16.1s)]
*  President Trump was not receiving the full level of protection at all of his events. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=22.06s)]
*  Also breaking today, an Afghan national living in Oklahoma, arrested, charged with plotting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=27.54s)]
*  a terror attack on Election Day in the U.S. on behalf of ISIS. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=32.1s)]
*  He entered the country under Harrison Biden just weeks after their disastrous Afghanistan [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=36.9s)]
*  withdrawal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=43.1s)]
*  We're now with more Senate Homeland Security Committee member Josh Hawley. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  Senator, what are we learning here? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  Because I know from people around President Trump that they have repeatedly requested [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=51.22s)]
*  more security and they have been denied again and again and again and again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=57.22s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=62.86s)]
*  You know, Sean, it sounds like he's still not getting the security that he's been promised. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=64.06s)]
*  And here's what this new whistleblower says. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=69.66s)]
*  He says that investigators are now not allowed to come to all the Trump rallies because if [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=71.86s)]
*  they did, they would see that Trump is not getting the full presidential protective detail. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=76.7s)]
*  He's only getting it selectively. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=81.9s)]
*  So the allegation is Secret Service leadership is now saying to its own internal investigators, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=83.56s)]
*  no, actually, wait, don't don't come to that event. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=88.84s)]
*  Come to this one over here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=91.52s)]
*  And they're trying to conceal the fact Trump is still not getting the full levels of protection. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=93.3s)]
*  I don't know why they're doing this, Sean. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Other than that, they don't want the public to know the truth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  And I tell you what, I've had enough of this from Secret Service leadership. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  I really have. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=105.36s)]
*  They need to level with the American people about what's going on here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=106.36s)]
*  They need to tell us if Trump is really getting all the security he needs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  These rallies need to be safe for everybody who goes to them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And I've had enough of the prevarication, of the concealment and the stonewalling. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=116.44s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=120.76s)]
*  Well, you were chased off the site at Butler when you went days after the shooting that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=121.76s)]
*  took place there, the assassination attempt there, which is unconscionable to me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  We know he's being denied, but we also know one other thing, and it's been widely reported [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=132.56s)]
*  that there are Iranian assassination squads in the country targeting Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=137.28s)]
*  With that knowledge, how is it possible that Trump International, a known area where people, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=143.08s)]
*  paparazzi, hide, that that area was never swept by the Secret Service? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=149.52s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=154.56s)]
*  How is it possible a guy gets within 130 yards of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, with a rifle [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=155.78s)]
*  in what would be a tap-in putt for somebody? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  How is all this going on? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=170.84s)]
*  And just to take the Trump International incident, I mean, think about this, Sean, another whistleblower, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=172.68s)]
*  different one, tells me that it is standard protocol at that golf course, which Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=177.16s)]
*  plays all the time, by the way, as you know, it's standard protocol to sweep it before [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=181.72s)]
*  Trump gets onto the course. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=186.16s)]
*  It's also standard protocol to post up agents at those places along the course where they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  know that there's a clean line of sight and they didn't do any of those things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=192.8s)]
*  I mean, Sean, what is going on here? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we've got to get the facts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=198.68s)]
*  We need answers and all we're getting from the leadership of the Secret Service is more [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  stonewalling. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=204.56s)]
*  They're not answering questions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=206.0s)]
*  They're not cooperating with investigators. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Now it looks like they're trying to mislead their own internal investigators. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=208.96s)]
*  My gosh, this has got to stop. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  And this director, Director Roe, he's got a lot to answer for, Sean. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=215.0s)]
*  I mean, I have to tell you, I am losing confidence in him by the minute. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  He said after the Trump International Course incident that everything worked perfectly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=222.92s)]
*  If that's perfect, how do you define imperfect? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=230.2s)]
*  All right, Senator Hawley, thank you for that update. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUBl4QfUdU&t=233.23999999999998s)]
