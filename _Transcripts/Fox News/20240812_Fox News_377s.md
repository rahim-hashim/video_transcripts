# Sources to Fox: Iran could strike Israel soon
**Fox News:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo)
*  All right, breaking tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Moments ago, Elon Musk said a cyberattack was responsible for the disruption during [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=2.34s)]
*  the Trump interview on X. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=7.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=8.78s)]
*  Well, just for the late start, we unfortunately had a massive distributed denial of service [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=9.78s)]
*  attack against our servers and saturated all of our data lines, like basically hundreds [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  of gigabits of data were saturated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=25.5s)]
*  We'veâ€”we think we've overcome most of that, and so it's now time to proceed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=28.74s)]
*  But as this massive attack illustrates, there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=34.82s)]
*  what President Trump has to say. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=44.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, that interview, which they will post in full, was only open to a limited [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=46.54s)]
*  number of people as a result of that attack. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  We're going to have more highlights coming up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=54.14s)]
*  This on the heels of what many now believe was an Iranian attack that took out President [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=56.86s)]
*  Trump, some was hacked into President Trump's website himself, and President Trump's website [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=62.74s)]
*  was put together by some of the smartest, brightest cybersecurity experts in the entire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=68.98s)]
*  world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=74.06s)]
*  That should be chilling and scary to everybody, both attacks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=75.62s)]
*  How did the Harris campaign respond? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=79.78s)]
*  They mocked the cyberattack? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=82.02s)]
*  Kamala, there's nothing funny about a DDoS attack or an outside country like Iran, Russia, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=84.14s)]
*  China hacking President Trump's website. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=93.38s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=96.66s)]
*  Matter of fact, it shows a vulnerability that may run far deeper than anybody knows. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=97.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, tensions are high all across the Middle East. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=102.94s)]
*  Again tonight, sources are telling our own Trey Yanks that Israel fears a strike from [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=106.14s)]
*  Iran could come at any moment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=110.9s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal tonight reporting that Israel has put the IDF on high alert. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=113.06s)]
*  Now, today the Pentagon announced a new deployment of American resources to the region here with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=117.82s)]
*  reaction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=123.22s)]
*  IDF, special ops veteran, Aaron Cohen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=124.22s)]
*  Before we get into the Iranian threat with Israel, it looks like the number one prime [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=127.38s)]
*  suspect in the Trump website attack is Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=131.54s)]
*  You heard Elon Musk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=135.82s)]
*  You know what a DDoS attack is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=137.46s)]
*  I don't think anybody really fully recognizes the danger, the existential threat that is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=140.54s)]
*  a cyberattack like this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=149.26s)]
*  Israel has to deal with this every day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=151.54s)]
*  When you hear that's happening in this country, I'm sure sirens are blaring in your head. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=154.46s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  No, Sean, you're absolutely right once again. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  The fact is that the cultural warfare campaign, which is what I'm calling the radical left's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=167.14s)]
*  deployment over the last three and a half years within this country to implode it, has [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=176.42s)]
*  single-handedly emboldened the Iranian Islamic regime to switch gears and do what the Islamic [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=182.62s)]
*  regime does, which is guerrilla warfare. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=191.82s)]
*  They're not going to go head to head with the United States, but what they're going [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  to do is they're going to switch tactics. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=198.42s)]
*  They're going to move into this cyber warfare, which we're seeing play out now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  This will be the second time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't believe in coincidences. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  That cyber warfare is designed to dismantle the U.S.'s technical capabilities specifically [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=207.66s)]
*  for the purpose of disrupting this campaign, which is very dangerous in my mind coming [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=214.66s)]
*  from that counterterror world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  The fact is, and here's where I'm at with this, the naive appeasement only boldens Iran, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  and the U.S. is not deterring Iran. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  Iran is laughing at the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=232.5s)]
*  But I'll tell you who they're scared of. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=236.06s)]
*  They're scared of Israel because they know that we can wreak such damage to the Iranian [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=238.06s)]
*  capabilities in such a short period of time that they are pausing right now to decide [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=245.1s)]
*  how far they want to go, Sean. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=251.7s)]
*  If they attack again on their own, you can pretty much, you know, you can't count on [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=254.94s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=260.82s)]
*  They already surrendered in the war on terror. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=262.3s)]
*  She wants to, you know, have the courage not to ever say Islamic radical terrorism again, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=264.34s)]
*  which is bizarre or illegal alien. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=269.34s)]
*  So, but Israel might be fighting a three or four front war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=271.5s)]
*  You might be fighting Hezbollah of the north, Hamas in the south, the Houthi rebels and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=275.42s)]
*  Iran at the same time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=280.26s)]
*  And then if you want to defend yourself and fight back, Harris and Biden will have nothing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=281.98s)]
*  to do with that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=287.74s)]
*  What does that say to you about the U.S. and your relationship with the U.S.? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=288.26s)]
*  Because it's embarrassing to me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=291.86s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're absolutely right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  It is dangerous and you nailed it on the head again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=296.34s)]
*  You seem to be the only person who understands the this language of the Middle East, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=298.3s)]
*  the language of the Middle East, which is the only thing that this region understands [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=303.02s)]
*  is that strength, that strength through people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=309.34s)]
*  I'll tell you what they're scared of, Sean. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=311.38s)]
*  They're scared of Donald Trump because they know that Donald Trump is going to back Israel, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=312.9s)]
*  give us the weapons and supplies we need. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  But Bibi will not wait and Israel will preemptively strike. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  And it's a disappointment as an American Israeli. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=323.06s)]
*  There's a slight fear of abandonment here, but we're going to get the job done. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=326.26s)]
*  And Israel is going to go go all the way as needed to protect because you saw what happened [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=330.58s)]
*  on October 7th, Sean. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  We don't have the luxury to not be good. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=336.62s)]
*  So we're taking all that into account and Israel is getting ready to ramp up as needed. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=339.1s)]
*  And we are not asking for the Biden-Harris administration's permission. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=343.38s)]
*  Oh, I don't think you need permission. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=349.38s)]
*  And we saw how deep Israel penetrated Iranian territory the last time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=351.22s)]
*  I have full confidence in the prime minister and the IDF. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=355.18s)]
*  If they're foolish enough to do it this time, the price has to be very heavy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=359.22s)]
*  Eric Hone, thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=363.26s)]
*  You can find the interview on our YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=369.06s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2fA71N_CFo&t=375.54s)]
