# Secretary Rubio: None of this is possible without Trump
**Fox News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js)
*  All right, welcome to Hour 2 of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Two major developments from the White House tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=6.2s)]
*  First, we are awaiting President Trump's meeting with newly freed hostage Mark Fogel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=8.76s)]
*  He was released from a Russian prison only hours ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Plus, according to the United States Envoy for Hostages, Adam Bowler, another American [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=16.76s)]
*  hostage will be released tomorrow. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=22.88s)]
*  Anyway, joining us now with more details. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=25.0s)]
*  On the phone, we have Secretary of State Marco Rubio, along with the U.S. Special Envoy for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=28.06s)]
*  Hostages nominee Adam Bowler is with us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=32.94s)]
*  First, Mr. Secretary, Secretary Rubio, let me say to you and to President Trump and to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  Steve Whitcoff and to Adam and everybody involved, it brings a lot of joy to me and to most Americans [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=44.7s)]
*  to know that America—and America has been released. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=51.54s)]
*  We look forward to tomorrow's news as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=54.9s)]
*  Can you tell us about what happened? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=57.78s)]
*  Well, first, let me just tell you, we have a great team here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=59.34s)]
*  Adam and his team do a great job with this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=62.38s)]
*  And Steve Whitcoff is phenomenal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=64.26s)]
*  But none of this is possible without President Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=65.78s)]
*  This is the 10th American that's come home after being detained somewhere overseas in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=68.54s)]
*  just three weeks in the White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=72.78s)]
*  It's an extraordinary achievement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=74.34s)]
*  And look, this is what happens when you have a strong president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=77.3s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=79.78s)]
*  And look, any time an American comes home, we should be excited about it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=80.78s)]
*  We have an appr—this is a case that languished under the Biden administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=83.82s)]
*  They really didn't give it priority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=88.13999999999999s)]
*  I met with the family. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  I believe the mother got to meet President Trump at that now, you know, infamous rally [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=91.5s)]
*  at Butler right the same day the president was almost killed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  And so tonight is really a happy occasion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=101.33999999999999s)]
*  Should be for all Americans, but certainly for Mr. Fogel and his family. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=104.06s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you said 10 American hostages released. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=107.78s)]
*  I was only aware of seven, including tonight. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=111.5s)]
*  Tomorrow would be eight. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=115.38s)]
*  And you know, the six Venezuelan hostages and the one tonight, what are the other three? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  We've got a couple we can introduce. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=125.58s)]
*  We have somebody in Anastasia that was actually brought over from Belarus to the border of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  Lithuania, where the ambassador, part of Marco Rubio's team, took her in and then flew her [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=136.66000000000003s)]
*  to the United States, and she is in Texas right now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=144.18s)]
*  And so that's another example. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=147.78s)]
*  We don't always get to advertise every one of them, but Sean, the team's doing great. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=149.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=155.86s)]
*  What can you tell us about this? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=157.66000000000003s)]
*  Maybe I'll go back to Secretary Rubio and then we'll get your take, Adam. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  You know, Vladimir Putin, you know, two things have developed, and I know you're active [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=164.94s)]
*  and involved to the hilt on both of them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=170.58s)]
*  President Zelensky saying he's open to a deal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=173.78s)]
*  Now Vladimir Putin got nothing in return, is my understanding, for the release of this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=176.78s)]
*  hostage. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=181.86s)]
*  Steve Witkoff goes, apparently met for three and a half hours with Vladimir Putin, and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=183.02s)]
*  brings home this hostage, and—which I think is spectacular, but I think it's very similar [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=189.26s)]
*  symbolic in the sense that—and Vladimir Putin had made very positive public comments [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=194.9s)]
*  about Donald Trump and the adult being back in the White House, basically. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=199.9s)]
*  What can we glean from this and read into this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=204.58s)]
*  Is this hopefully the end of war in Europe? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, I wouldn't—one has nothing to do with the other directly, per se. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=210.9s)]
*  But it will in time because of the following reason. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  We have a strong president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=218.62s)]
*  And I think people forget, you know, how important that is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=219.62s)]
*  At the end of the day, we are dealing all over the world with strong leaders. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  We may not like them or what they do, but these are strong leaders that respect strength. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we have with Donald Trump in the White House. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=231.1s)]
*  And he also made this a campaign priority. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=233.66s)]
*  So I think you're beginning to see the fruits of what happened when we're led by a strong [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=236.06s)]
*  president who does what he says he's going to do and doesn't just give it lip service. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=239.26s)]
*  And I think that the reason why this might be linked to some of the other things over [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=244.82s)]
*  time is because of that strength. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=248.22s)]
*  When you have a president that's strong like Donald Trump, you're going to have a chance [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=250.5s)]
*  to achieve things, whether it's in Ukraine and ending that war, whether it's some of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=254.18s)]
*  the conflicts that we're now seeing in the Middle East or anywhere in the world, because [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=258.54s)]
*  they know he's not playing around. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=262.14s)]
*  I mean, he says he's going to do it and then he does it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=263.14s)]
*  This is not some president that wastes a lot of time talking about things that he's never [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=265.54s)]
*  going to do or doesn't mean to do. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=269.82s)]
*  If he says he's going to do something, he'll do it, and these leaders know it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=271.14s)]
*  And so hopefully that will bear fruit in a bunch of places beyond just what we're seeing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  tonight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=278.86s)]
*  And, Mr. Secretary, let me ask you—and I know you were in the meeting with King Abdullah [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=280.26s)]
*  today from Jordan, and he seemed supportive, at least on some level, of the president's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=285.22s)]
*  plan for Gaza, which is to clean up the rubble, clean out the mess and begin a process of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=292.22s)]
*  rebuilding Gaza and also demilitarizing the area of militants. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=297.86s)]
*  And he also gave a deadline of Saturday at noon for Hamas to release all the hostages [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=303.7s)]
*  or all hell will break loose. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=309.4s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=311.24s)]
*  What was your take on the meeting? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=312.24s)]
*  Well, it was always a good meeting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=314.24s)]
*  Jordan is a great ally of the United States, and the King's been a longtime ally of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=316.36s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=320.08s)]
*  We work very closely on a lot of things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=321.08s)]
*  But here's the bottom line. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=322.08s)]
*  If people don't like the Trump plan for Gaza, right now it's the only plan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=323.44s)]
*  And so I think it's now incumbent upon the Arab countries and our allies, we work very [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=326.88s)]
*  closely with them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=330.96s)]
*  If they think they've got a better plan, we need to hear it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=331.96s)]
*  And so hopefully that will be the product of that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=334.96s)]
*  And as far as the ceasefire is concerned, look, Hamas is breaking the deal. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=337.12s)]
*  The president's tired of the drip, drip, drip of he wants people out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  You saw the condition of the hostages that were released just a week ago and they were [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  on the verge of death. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=347.52s)]
*  I mean, they looked terrible. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=348.52s)]
*  They were really clearly in bad shape. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=349.52s)]
*  And the president just got fed up with it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=351.88s)]
*  If these guys don't go through with their deal on Saturday, then I think we're back [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=353.44s)]
*  to where we were a few months ago where Hamas is going to be eliminated. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  The Israelis are going to go in and take care of that problem. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=360.0s)]
*  Let's hope it doesn't get to that point. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=362.44s)]
*  But he's serious about it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's tired of waiting for one people, two people, three people at a time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=365.24s)]
*  It's time for all of them to come home. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=370.16s)]
*  We can't ignore the fact that the president, as his first foreign visitor, was Prime Minister [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=373.68s)]
*  Netanyahu, nor can we ignore the fact that weapons that were denied Israel, powerful [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=379.68s)]
*  bombs that are the equivalent of those bunker busters, he released to Israel, which should [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=385.68s)]
*  be an indication that if that deadline is missed on Saturday, that I would not only [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  think that Hamas should be nervous, but I would think that the Iranians also should [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=397.44s)]
*  be concerned. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=401.76s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=402.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think anybody who is an enemy of the United States or anyone who seeks harm to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=403.76s)]
*  the United States should be very concerned because Donald Trump has, President Trump [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=408.08s)]
*  has a history of acting on what he says. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=412.44s)]
*  Just ask the Iranians with Soleimani, just multiple incidents that, and things that would [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=414.68s)]
*  have never happened, okay? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  What happened in Afghanistan would have never happened under Donald Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=420.68s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened if Donald Trump was president. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  The war in Ukraine would have never happened. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=426.68s)]
*  But we had a weakness in the White House, and that led to these sorts of things happening. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  They're not going to happen now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=432.76000000000005s)]
*  Adam, let's talk about—I know that there has been an announcement that another hostage, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=434.56s)]
*  besides Mark Fogel, will be released tomorrow. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't have any details. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  Is there any light you can shed on that? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, I would say it's another in a stream of hostages. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=451.8s)]
*  It'll be unilateral as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=456.16s)]
*  And I can't release until the person's released. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, it could endanger a hostage release, and that I can't do. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=460.72s)]
*  But I can say that we expect another one tomorrow, and hopefully a lot more through that, because [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=465.12s)]
*  the president made it a priority to get all Americans home. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  Adam, how many hostages, American hostages, are there worldwide that maybe most Americans [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  don't know about? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  If it's all—there's definitional questions on this one, but let me try to answer it the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  best I can, which is when you look at hostages and people that are being withheld, that shouldn't [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  be withheld—you're talking about 100-plus—I will tell you right now, there are 6,000 Americans [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=493.84s)]
*  in foreign jails. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  That doesn't mean everybody's innocent, by the way. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  Right now, there are 6,000 Americans in foreign jails. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=503.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=507.76s)]
*  Secretary Rubio, you know, since Donald Trump has been elected—and it's hard to imagine—he's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=508.76s)]
*  only begun his fourth week, and now his second term here, and he's working at the speed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  of light, and I'm sure you're burning the midnight oil every night as well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=519.36s)]
*  And as we look at all these different hot spots around the world, I think I'm more [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=524.72s)]
*  optimistic than I've been in a long time. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=530.6s)]
*  And we saw, for example, Colombia and Canada and Mexico. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  I know you were actively involved and you went to Panama. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=538.48s)]
*  The issue of the Panama Canal and a violation of that treaty was in the forefront. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=542.76s)]
*  My sources are telling me that a deal is within reach that will be very favorable to America. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=549.88s)]
*  Any insight you can give us into that negotiation? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=556.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, the Panamanians have a process there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=559.28s)]
*  They are a country of laws. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=562.88s)]
*  They have to work through their system to get a good result. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=563.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think we left there with a very firm understanding that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=566.36s)]
*  the status quo in the Panama Canal was not acceptable. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=569.64s)]
*  As the president said, we gave the canal over to Panama, not to China. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=572.08s)]
*  And I think we'll see—have already seen concrete steps of the first country in the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=576.6s)]
*  Western Hemisphere to pull out of the Belt and Road Initiative. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=580.4s)]
*  I think there are other things forthcoming as well. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=583.2s)]
*  And look, it's a serious issue. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=585.84s)]
*  I mean, if that canal were to be blocked in a time of conflict by the Chinese, we—or [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=587.28s)]
*  anybody for that matter—we would have a lot of trouble getting naval assets over into [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=592.12s)]
*  the Pacific or back home to the U.S. for refueling or what have you, for restockpiling. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=596.2s)]
*  So it's an important—you know, there's a reason why they built it, and it's important [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=601.76s)]
*  to national security. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=606.76s)]
*  So I feel optimistic about that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=608.3s)]
*  It'll take a few more weeks to work through some of the details. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=609.96s)]
*  But again, I work for a president, President Donald Trump, who comes at things with a position [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=612.32s)]
*  of strength. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=617.88s)]
*  And people know it's not just tough talk. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=618.88s)]
*  I mean, he now has a history of acting on what he says he's going to do. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=620.0s)]
*  And he's always going to be on the American side of every issue. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=623.36s)]
*  I can't say that enough. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=625.88s)]
*  We had a foreign policy for a long time. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=627.38s)]
*  And I want to say, even under multiple administrations of both parties, we're oftentimes—it felt [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=629.22s)]
*  like we were arguing on behalf of what was good for the world. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=633.48s)]
*  And we're not for things that are bad for the world. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=636.36s)]
*  But we're the government of the United States. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=638.72s)]
*  We have to be first and foremost for what's good for the United States and for our people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=640.84s)]
*  And that's been completely lost in foreign policy. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=644.72s)]
*  Now it's back. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=647.02s)]
*  And I think you're seeing the—and there's more and more to come. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=648.36s)]
*  Would it be fair to characterize your feeling after being in Panama, that you have a high [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=653.4s)]
*  degree of confidence that a deal will be reached that will be favorable? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=656.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have a good outcome with the Panamanians. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=661.24s)]
*  Look, they're good friends. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=664.12s)]
*  I mean, the president of Panama is very pro-American. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=665.12s)]
*  And they've got to work through their own internal process. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=669.58s)]
*  They have laws about how they can do certain things, and they have to do it the right way. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=671.5400000000001s)]
*  And we want them to do it the right way. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=675.1s)]
*  But ultimately, we want to get an outcome that's good for them, by the way. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=676.34s)]
*  It's not good for them to have the canal with the kind of influence that another country [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  has over it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  So I think we're going to get a very good outcome there. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=683.6600000000001s)]
*  And we already have seen some things happen, and more are going to be happening. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=686.34s)]
*  And we just got to let that work its way through a little bit. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=689.74s)]
*  And—but we're going to get there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, Adam, I'll give you the last question here. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=693.86s)]
*  You're the special envoy for hostages. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=697.66s)]
*  And as we've been saying all night, we're moments away from Mark Fogel being released [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=701.1s)]
*  and showing up at the White House. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=707.22s)]
*  We know he landed in Washington, D.C. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=708.5s)]
*  He might even be at the White House at this moment. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=711.66s)]
*  As soon as that—as soon as we get some video of that, we'll bring it to you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=713.86s)]
*  That's him getting off the plane back on American soil that we're showing our audience [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=717.42s)]
*  right now. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=720.9s)]
*  But I want to go back. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=722.82s)]
*  I think every American, when they hear about American hostages, it makes their blood boil. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=724.5s)]
*  And Americans want our hostages fought for. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=732.1800000000001s)]
*  And they want these—they want our hostages brought home. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  And you know, are there areas of the world that you fear—that you feel that you have [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=739.98s)]
*  a high degree of confidence that we will be able to negotiate the return of Americans [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=745.58s)]
*  that have been held for, you know, any length of time? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=750.82s)]
*  I want to say something just because we just went out there and I witnessed a secretary [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=754.98s)]
*  of state, a national security adviser, the president's best friend, stand in the cold, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  in the snow, waiting for Mark Fogel. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=766.74s)]
*  I was there with them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=769.9s)]
*  And what that represents is Americans—this is why the president was elected by Americans. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=771.46s)]
*  There's none of this high horse things. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=778.06s)]
*  We wait for Americans. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=781.34s)]
*  Our job is on behalf of Americans. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=783.3s)]
*  And I thought it was awesome to see. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=785.18s)]
*  And I think the pictures will bear it out. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=786.62s)]
*  He's with us in a convoy right now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=788.02s)]
*  I'm in the car with the secretary. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=789.54s)]
*  And we're taking him to the president, who told us, by the way, I don't care what time [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=791.38s)]
*  he comes in, I never go to sleep. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=795.26s)]
*  So that's the man that we're following. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=797.46s)]
*  I just want everybody to know that because— [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=799.7s)]
*  I think Secretary Rubio and I personally can vouch for that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=802.98s)]
*  He does not sleep. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=808.18s)]
*  Well, if he does, I don't know what time it's at. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=810.14s)]
*  I think I've talked to him over the years all hours of the 24-hour day. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=813.3399999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=819.18s)]
*  But it's certainly better than a president that went to bed at 6 o'clock every night [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=820.3s)]
*  and maybe worked two or three hours a day. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=825.7399999999999s)]
*  It's been a refreshing change. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=829.3s)]
*  Listen, Secretary Rubio— [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=831.54s)]
*  So, Sean, just to answer your question, you have to— [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=833.0999999999999s)]
*  What's that? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=835.9799999999999s)]
*  Any specific regions? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=837.02s)]
*  All of them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6E37_Xm8Js&t=838.5s)]
