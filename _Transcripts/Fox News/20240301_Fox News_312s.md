# James Comer: Joe Biden received 40K in 'laundered China money' from his brother
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4)
*  Here with reaction House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=0.0s)]
*  Before we get to anything else, I want to settle a little bit of business here [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=3.2s)]
*  because I don't think some people know how committees work. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=6.8s)]
*  They usually work together in terms of who's gonna ask the questions, etc. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=10.24s)]
*  and it was brought up that you didn't specifically yourself ask questions [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=15.16s)]
*  and then the question of why did you allow the concession to Hunter in terms [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=20.04s)]
*  of not videotaping it [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=25.04s)]
*  and allow for the second subpoena to be sent that was not afforded, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  those opportunities not afforded to people like Navarro or Bannon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, with respect to not asking questions, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=37.84s)]
*  Jim Jordan didn't ask questions either. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=40.16s)]
*  We work with our staff attorneys. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=41.88s)]
*  Mine was a top deposer in the Trump Department of Justice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  He's better at asking questions than I am. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=48.84s)]
*  So I want the best people asking questions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=50.88s)]
*  So I had my staffer ask the questions that I approved for the first hour [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=52.56s)]
*  and Jim Jordan's staffer asked the questions for the second hour. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=56.56s)]
*  So that answers that question. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=59.72s)]
*  With respect to the video, that was what the Biden team was demanding. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=61.32s)]
*  They didn't want a video. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=66.0s)]
*  They didn't want a video, which I think is funny and ironic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=67.0s)]
*  because they were saying they wanted a public hearing, a public hearing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=69.68s)]
*  Well, we're gonna have a public hearing and the American people are gonna get [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  to see Hunter Biden in person. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=75.84s)]
*  And with respect to the second subpoena, when he defied the first subpoena, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=78.48s)]
*  then that subpoena was expired. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=84.36s)]
*  So we wanted to get him in for the deposition. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=89.0s)]
*  I think the evidence that we got is very valuable as we move forward [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  to try to hold this family accountable. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  So I think what we did was right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=97.16s)]
*  A lot of people have criticized saying we should have taken the deal for this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=98.8s)]
*  or this, the deal for that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=102.16s)]
*  He came in on our terms. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  The only thing that they got that they wanted was not videotaping it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=105.35999999999999s)]
*  We've got the transcript. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  The transcript shows that Hunter Biden wasn't truthful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=110.56s)]
*  He accused his former business associates of lying. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=113.68s)]
*  He admitted that Joe Biden did, in fact, get $40,000 that came from China. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=117.0s)]
*  So, so many things that we've been talking about in our investigation [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=122.6s)]
*  were proven in the deposition. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=126.6s)]
*  I think the deposition was a huge success. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=127.8s)]
*  Now, it seems like they want to renege on a public hearing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=130.52s)]
*  Let's go to the issue of him saying that he was either high or drunk [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=133.68s)]
*  when he sent the WhatsApp message. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=138.64s)]
*  He was, quote, out of his mind. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=141.44s)]
*  So he doesn't even know if the text was sent, doesn't remember sending the text, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=144.08s)]
*  doesn't even know if the text is real, which I'd like to see the evidence [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=148.44s)]
*  that it was tampered with. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=152.16s)]
*  But he can remember with certainty that his father wasn't there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  But he was out of his mind. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  But he did remember that part of that, that, that text. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=159.4s)]
*  That sound credible to you? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=163.72s)]
*  Doesn't sound very credible to me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=165.24s)]
*  No. No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=166.88s)]
*  And I think that the American people can read the transcript [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=169.2s)]
*  and make a common sense decision and determination on whether or not [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  the president's son was being truthful. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=177.32s)]
*  Look, when he had to play the drug card, he played the drug card. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  When he had to play the Russian disinformation card, he played that card. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=183.28s)]
*  With respect to the text, we've all seen the text, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=187.44s)]
*  and their texts are all over the board where he says, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=190.24s)]
*  I had to give my father half my income. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=191.88s)]
*  There are other texts where he admitted to being involved with the child, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=193.56s)]
*  the Chinese spy chief for the whole country of China. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=199.12s)]
*  So he knew he was committing wrongdoing in the text. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=204.56s)]
*  But when we press him on the text, his lawyer would say, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=208.4s)]
*  well, we don't believe that these texts are legitimate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=211.48s)]
*  We believe that the laptop was compromised. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=215.6s)]
*  And then when there was no doubt that he sent the text, he would say, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=218.16s)]
*  well, I was high. I was high. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=221.12s)]
*  Or I sent that text to the wrong person. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=223.32s)]
*  You don't understand the meaning of that text. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, explain it to us. Well, I was high. I was high. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=227.68s)]
*  But I know my dad wasn't sitting beside me when I sent that WhatsApp message. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=230.28s)]
*  But I was so high. So he played the drug card a lot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=234.08s)]
*  They played the Russia card a lot. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=237.36s)]
*  But I think the American people see in this transcript that the Biden family [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  has been lying about their involvement and the amount of money [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  they've taken in from China from day one. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=249.44s)]
*  So we've proven that the family was influence peddling. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  We've proven that Joe Biden was lying to the American people from day one [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  when he said he wasn't involved and his family didn't get any money from China. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=258.0s)]
*  Now what we're trying to do is go to the next phase, have the public hearing, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=261.68s)]
*  bring all the associates in and let everyone see every one side of the story [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=265.64s)]
*  and make a determination. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=271.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we're going to try to hold this family accountable. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=272.8s)]
*  We're going to try to have referrals. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=275.68s)]
*  We're going to try to identify the people in the deep state that were part of the cover up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=277.56s)]
*  Because remember, in addition to the Biden financial crimes, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=281.76s)]
*  we also have the cover up by the deep state actors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=284.76s)]
*  So we're trying to hold everyone accountable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=287.48s)]
*  We're trying to wrap this up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=289.56s)]
*  And I think that the deposition with Hunter Biden and the transcript interview [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=290.88s)]
*  with Jim Biden were huge successes. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Chairman Comer, thank you for sharing that with us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=297.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd4cMDvHJs4&t=311.76s)]
