# Hannity: Proof that DEI overtook the FAA
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70)
*  Some difficult news from D.C., our nation's capital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=0.0s)]
*  There are no survivors from last night's horrific midair collision between an Army [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=3.5s)]
*  Black Hawk helicopter and that regional passenger jet near Reagan National Airport. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=7.32s)]
*  All told, 67 people lost their lives, including 64 passengers and crew, on American Airlines [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=12.56s)]
*  Flight 5342. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=19.44s)]
*  All three soldiers aboard the Black Hawk helicopter are lost. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=21.84s)]
*  Tonight, we are praying for the victims. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=26.16s)]
*  We're praying for their families. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=28.2s)]
*  There are no words that can truly encapsulate the scale of this tragedy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=29.46s)]
*  And now Americans are searching for answers as they should. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=34.9s)]
*  How could a Black Hawk Army helicopter crash into a passenger jet that was landing at [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=38.32s)]
*  Reagan National? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=43.86s)]
*  At this hour, I wish I had all the answers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=45.22s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=47.58s)]
*  I can't tell you exactly how or why this happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=48.58s)]
*  But we are gleaning information that is quite alarming. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=51.38s)]
*  According to a report, John Solomon, JustTheNews.com, last night's midair collision was preceded [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=54.78s)]
*  by months and years now of near misses and safety warnings. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=61.06s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  In 2023, there were 19 near misses at airports all across the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  That is one of the largest totals in many years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=73.14s)]
*  In 2024, more are the same, including at Reagan National Airport, where multiple collisions [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=76.86s)]
*  were narrowly avoided. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=83.13999999999999s)]
*  Look at this headline from May of 2024. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=84.77999999999999s)]
*  Quote, federal officials are investigating another close call between planes at Reagan [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  National Airport. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=92.08s)]
*  And as John Solomon is pointing out, an expert report sent to the FAA under Biden warned [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  directly, quote, America's air traffic control system is suffering from quality control issues [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  and staffing shortages that put safety at risk. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=107.22s)]
*  They were warned repeatedly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=111.32s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=113.32s)]
*  The New York Times tonight reporting, quote, control tower staffing at Reagan National [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=114.32s)]
*  Airport was not normal during last night's deadly crash. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=119.52s)]
*  And according to CBS News, quote, one air traffic control worker was managing the helicopters [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=123.55999999999999s)]
*  and the planes, a job normally done by two people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=129.68s)]
*  In December, the CEO of United Airlines warned that an ongoing air traffic controller shortage [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  is now a major problem. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=140.52s)]
*  But the last administration, they had other priorities. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=142.18s)]
*  You know, pothole Mayor Pete, Biden's transportation secretary, preoccupied. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=145.84s)]
*  You might remember, you know, launched that billion dollar pilot project to build, you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=150.8s)]
*  know, equity in America's roads and bridges and focused on climate change and DEI programs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=156.16s)]
*  It is no secret that across the entire Biden administration, DEI was prioritized over merit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=163.12s)]
*  But it didn't start with Obama, with Biden under Obama. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  The FAA launched the National Outreach Program for Diversity and Inclusion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  This included a push to hire workers with severe intellectual disabilities and psychiatric [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=179.38s)]
*  problems. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=186.82s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  A 2024 lawsuit also alleged that the FAA turned away nearly a thousand air traffic control [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  applicants solely based on their race. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=195.68s)]
*  As reported by The Washington Times, a 2013 FAA document raised the issue in stark terms, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=199.1s)]
*  asking how much of a change in job performance is acceptable to achieve diversity goals. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=205.56s)]
*  It turns out that for years, Democrats were playing woke politics with our lives. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  Apparently, the FAA included these insane DEI directives on their website until just [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  a few days ago, when Donald Trump signed that executive order banning DEI across government [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=222.08s)]
*  agencies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=227.08s)]
*  Now, we don't know how last night's crash occurred. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=228.08s)]
*  We're being very clear about that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=231.68s)]
*  But one thing is clear. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=234.28s)]
*  Sirens have been blaring the last number of years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=236.44s)]
*  And under Biden and pothole Pete and Kamala Harris, every warning sign was clearly ignored. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=240.52s)]
*  In all areas of government, meritocracy must return throughout the land in every regard. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da-z9ZY0g70&t=247.64s)]
