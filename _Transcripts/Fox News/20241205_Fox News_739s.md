# Kellyanne Conway: Biden is embarrassing us on the world stage, but Trump will fix it
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk)
*  All right, here with reaction, Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway, the incoming deputy chief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=0.0s)]
*  of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, along with Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Kellyanne, start with you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=9.44s)]
*  Let's get your reaction to these last-minute maneuverings of Joe Biden and the administration, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=11.48s)]
*  seemingly designed to put roadblocks in the way for the incoming president. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=18.0s)]
*  It's problematic, but everybody sees it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=22.96s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump's approval rating right now, as the president in waiting, is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=26.68s)]
*  higher than the number of people actually voted for him, the percentage he got in the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=30.24s)]
*  popular vote, which is pretty high, Sean, because people already see him communicating [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=33.96s)]
*  with us instantly, free of charge, on social media, telling us what he thinks of tariffs [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=38.0s)]
*  for Canada and Mexico, telling us what he thinks of the U.S. deal, telling us he's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=42.64s)]
*  going to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame, going to the Patriot Awards with you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=46.2s)]
*  and our colleagues tomorrow in New York. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=49.6s)]
*  He is telling us what the president is thinking and wanting to do on their behalf. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=52.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, already one of the least popular presidents in recent memory, is making that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=56.72s)]
*  worse now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=61.12s)]
*  Democrats are mad at him for two things, for staying in the race too long and for then, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=62.12s)]
*  late in the game, pardoning his son, and they're attacking him by name. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=66.36s)]
*  He's embarrassing us on the world stage. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=69.72s)]
*  But what was Donald Trump's closing argument, Sean? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=71.8s)]
*  I will fix it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=74.32s)]
*  Everybody knows who's breaking it and continue to break it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=76.36s)]
*  Donald Trump will fix it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=78.28s)]
*  And I don't think some of the stuff that Joe Biden is doing is authoritative and that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump will have to own and eat it, meaning some of it he's doing would have [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=84.66s)]
*  to go through congressional approval. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=87.86s)]
*  He's not even bothering with that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=89.9s)]
*  I love Charlamagne the God pushing back on these women. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=91.54s)]
*  He's got higher ratings than they do, by the way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=94.86s)]
*  I looked it up before the show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=96.86s)]
*  But when he said to them, can't you admit the Democrats are wrong? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=98.82s)]
*  Let me tell you quickly, the differences between the Democrat and Republican Party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=101.7s)]
*  We took our insurgent, our political outsider, our disruptor, and made him a two-term president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=105.92s)]
*  They took Bernie Sanders in 2016, who beat Hillary Clinton in 23 primary caucuses contests, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=111.12s)]
*  and kicked him out, made sure he didn't get the nomination in 2016 or 2020. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  In 2024, they took their insurgent, political outsider, disruptor, RFK Jr., wouldn't give [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=120.6s)]
*  him access to the DNC voter rolls, the donor list, the debate stage. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=126.28s)]
*  Where is he now? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=131.32s)]
*  He endorsed President Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=132.36s)]
*  He's been a huge help. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=133.36s)]
*  And he's going to be in his cabinet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=134.36s)]
*  That's the difference between the two parties. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=135.84s)]
*  That, plus, we've gone from the Obama coalition to Trump country in 12 short years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=137.56s)]
*  And people like The View, people like Joe Biden, who's at the end of his 55-year political [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=143.32s)]
*  career in Washington, D.C., as the Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp, he can't take it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=147.8s)]
*  He never saw Trump coming. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  He's going to go into history, I think, as a very unpopular president who gave us an [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=154.4s)]
*  equally unpopular vice president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=159.68s)]
*  All right, report Stephen Miller that they are trying to Trump-proof their words, the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=162.84s)]
*  DOJ, with all these late-minute hires. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=168.08s)]
*  We know that they have new contracts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Why are they signing new contracts when they have a new president that they know wants [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=173.0s)]
*  to cut back on the bureaucracy and limit the size and scope and influence of government? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=176.62s)]
*  Then you've got Ukraine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=181.96s)]
*  Why, the guy that wouldn't allow Poland to give Zelensky 28 megs and wouldn't allow [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=183.36s)]
*  Ukraine to use certain bombs? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=189.52s)]
*  Now, at the last minute, is approving ballistic missiles being fired from Ukraine into Russia, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=191.72s)]
*  knowing Donald Trump wants a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=197.72s)]
*  Tell me the logic behind this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=200.44s)]
*  It's desperation, Sean. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=205.08s)]
*  The Democrats were not only beaten, but they were electorally crushed in a historic landslide. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=206.8s)]
*  You've done the numbers, the electoral college, the popular vote, historic numbers of Hispanic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=212.84s)]
*  men, black men, Muslim voters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=218.36s)]
*  Every single demographic group moved Republican in this last election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=222.24s)]
*  Every single part of the country, all 50 states, move Republican. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=227.28s)]
*  So the Democrats are humiliated, defeated and weakened. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=231.04s)]
*  And these are all moves that come out of that desperation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=234.32s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=237.52s)]
*  When President Trump is inaugurated, he is the president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=238.8s)]
*  He can void those contracts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  He can reverse any decision that Joe Biden has made. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=245.82s)]
*  No president can constitutionally impair their successor from executing their mandate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=249.26s)]
*  And Donald Trump, on day one, will implement his agenda in its entirety, from energy to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=255.18s)]
*  deregulation to bureaucratic reform, to sealing the border shut, to restoring peace and stability [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=261.14s)]
*  around the globe, and of course, to pursuing record-shattering economic growth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=266.22s)]
*  It will happen quickly, and it will happen with the full support and backing of the Americans, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=270.42s)]
*  the Democrat, Republican, Independent, who are hungry and yearning for change. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  How, Jason Chavitz, do you prevent the Department of Justice from ever being weaponized again? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=279.74s)]
*  How do you return the FBI, the world's premier law enforcement agency, to its former greatness [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=287.5s)]
*  and get politics out of that department? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  How do you return our intelligence community to its former greatness? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=296.44s)]
*  It seems to me that a lot of people deep down inside the bowels of these agencies, departments, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=300.62s)]
*  are going to need to be fired and wiped out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=308.02s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  Will the president have that authority? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he has the authority. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=315.06s)]
*  He just needs to have the people in place to actually make it happen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=316.5s)]
*  And you got to clear out that top tier. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=319.58s)]
*  In part, you got to steer the star of the beast for the bureaucracy, but for the law [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=322.34s)]
*  enforcement components, the FBI and the CIA and the other types of things. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=326.38000000000005s)]
*  Look, they've got to be functional. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=330.5s)]
*  They've got to be working. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=333.54s)]
*  They've got to reset the mission. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=334.54s)]
*  Once you clear out the bureaucracy, clear out the top people there, you have got to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  get them focused back on the mission. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  That is to make America great, to lock down that border, to make sure that the United [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  States is no longer pushed around. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=347.16s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been sending those signals, and he's doing it right away. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=349.82000000000005s)]
*  He just sent out that truth message to those in Gaza and said, you better darn well release [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=352.9s)]
*  those sausages by January 20th or there is hell to be paid. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=359.17999999999995s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=363.5s)]
*  Our enemies, they will start to respect the United States of America and our allies will [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=364.5s)]
*  love us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=370.06s)]
*  They are starving for leadership. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=371.06s)]
*  Who's running this country at this point, for goodness sake? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=372.62s)]
*  Joe Biden's taking a nap. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris is doing who knows what. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  They're handing out billions of dollars, signing these contracts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=379.14s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  America is sick of it, but they see hope over the horizon. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=383.70000000000005s)]
*  It's in Donald Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=385.94s)]
*  He will get us back on track. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=387.22s)]
*  He will make America safer. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=388.62s)]
*  He will lock down those borders. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=389.98s)]
*  We're going to go after the drug cartels. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=391.54s)]
*  We're going to knock out the Chinese from the manipulation that they've been doing on [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  fentanyl and everything else. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=397.22s)]
*  And America will feel better and better and better. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's all because of Donald Trump's, his landslide victory. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  People believe him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=406.26000000000005s)]
*  He told the truth. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=407.26000000000005s)]
*  And there's this surge of patriotism that is just contagious. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=408.26000000000005s)]
*  You know, Kellyanne, if the president simply keeps his promises, which is, OK, we're [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  going to secure the border. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  We're going to stop, you know, all these unvetted illegals from coming into our country, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  if he deports the criminals and other people that broke the law, if he returns to law and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=424.74s)]
*  order in small towns and big cities, if he fix the economy, which I think is going to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=429.74s)]
*  be a little more, I think will be challenging, but on the other hand, he's done it before, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  he'll do it again. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=439.17999999999995s)]
*  If he makes us the most rich, energy-dominant country on earth, if he restores America's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=440.42s)]
*  place in the world, if he eliminates DEI and woke in our schools, won't that be in and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  of itself, that small, those small agenda items that are huge, won't that be transformational [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  in and of itself? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=459.3s)]
*  Yes, he's a transformational once-in-a-century figure, once in a couple generation figure [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=460.3s)]
*  for exactly that reason. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=466.92s)]
*  It's the messenger and the delivery. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=468.38s)]
*  The delivery now is not a style, it's a system. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=470.54s)]
*  He went on TikTok, he went on podcasts, he continued to go on traditional and unconventional [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  media. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  But the message and the messenger is what will carry the day. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  You just laid out exactly what he ran on. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=481.54s)]
*  Donald Trump was transparent and granular about what he wants to do in his second term. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=484.18s)]
*  In some ways, Sean, he wants to return us to where we were in 2019, before the year [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=488.86s)]
*  of the global pandemic and social unrest, where we had low interest rates, we had low [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=492.82s)]
*  unemployment, we had high wage growth, we had a majority of new jobs going to women [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=497.98s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=502.46s)]
*  We had really a rising tide lifting all boats. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=503.46s)]
*  But you just said a few things that Biden made worse. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=505.82s)]
*  In some ways, people want Trump, the Trump they had back, but they want the Trump to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=510.58s)]
*  come and reverse so many of these terrible, spiteful policies. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=514.24s)]
*  Please don't anybody tell me it was ideological and principled of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=518.66s)]
*  to kill those Keystone pipeline jobs that was spite, to pull us out of Afghanistan. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=523.46s)]
*  What is the difference to have a female vice president of the United States here if the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=528.26s)]
*  women in Afghan are less free and have fewer rights because she and her boss did what they [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=532.1s)]
*  did? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=535.98s)]
*  They did a lot on spite. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=536.98s)]
*  I think Donald Trump can get in there through executive orders, through reconciliation, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=537.98s)]
*  through legislation with slim majorities in the House and Senate nonetheless, and through [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=542.26s)]
*  these departments and agencies in and of themselves that can do so many things in the dereg space [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=546.1s)]
*  the executive office of the presidency and our departments and agencies. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=552.78s)]
*  He's going to move with alacrity and he's putting a senior staff around him and a cabinet, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  all of whom can do that philosophically, practically, and more importantly, Sean, he's picking [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=560.98s)]
*  people, communicate a message. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=565.94s)]
*  They can come onto your show and tell you exactly, tell the American people exactly [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=567.38s)]
*  what's going on in their department and agency. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  All right, Stephen, you're going to be the deputy chief of staff for policy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  So the question is, how quickly can the president accomplish those main agenda items? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  The big promises that he made on the campaign trail. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=581.9s)]
*  Well, let me paint a picture for you, Sean, of those first 100 days. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=584.34s)]
*  Rapid, total, complete deregulation of American energy exploration. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=590.06s)]
*  You're going to see an American energy boom starting right away. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=594.5s)]
*  You're going to see all the regulations that are strangling job growth in this country [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=597.38s)]
*  and driving up prices, driving up housing costs go away. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=600.78s)]
*  You're going to see the border sealed shut. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=604.14s)]
*  The criminal aliens are going to be shipped home and foreign countries around the world [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=606.3s)]
*  are going to accept the gang members and the cartel members that are poisoning our [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=609.54s)]
*  families and murdering American children. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=614.26s)]
*  You are going to see peace begin to restore to the world as the president works to bring [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=617.06s)]
*  back harmony in the Middle East, harmony in Europe. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=621.38s)]
*  You're going to see him work with Congress to pass another round of historic tax relief. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=624.4599999999999s)]
*  And you're going to see a government that is accountable to the people again. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  The swamp will be drained on day one. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  Incompetent and disloyal people that are hurting this nation are going to be replaced [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=635.3s)]
*  with those who care only for the American people, the American worker and the American [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  future. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=644.3s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=645.3s)]
*  It will be a new golden age, Sean. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=646.3s)]
*  I'll tell you, if all that happens, America will be transformed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=648.4599999999999s)]
*  You know the intel community well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=652.5s)]
*  You know the FBI well. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=654.0999999999999s)]
*  You know the DOJ well. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=655.8s)]
*  You've investigated all of it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=657.18s)]
*  Jason Chavitz, how hard will it be to clean those agencies out? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=659.14s)]
*  Well you've got to get into the bowels of it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=664.6199999999999s)]
*  You know I was the chairman of the oversight committee. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  We were constantly going after them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=668.7399999999999s)]
*  But they would hide the documents. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=670.7399999999999s)]
*  They would hide the information. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  But once Cash Patel, for instance, is in there and he can get in there and have the access [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=674.18s)]
*  with Pam Bondi and start releasing those documents, you're going to see a transformational, it's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=679.18s)]
*  going to fundamentally change the eclation. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=685.78s)]
*  The world needs clarity, leadership and they need to understand that the United States [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=688.42s)]
*  of America is the world's superpower and Donald Trump delivers all of that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=693.62s)]
*  I am so, I've never been more excited about the future of our country with Donald Trump [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=697.82s)]
*  starting on January 20th. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=702.34s)]
*  I do think Kellyanne's right. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=704.42s)]
*  I think this is an opportunity that comes along once every hundred years to really have [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=705.62s)]
*  a radical but real and necessary reset, return to constitutional order. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=710.38s)]
*  And that means limited government, greater freedom and that eliminates waste, fraud and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=716.66s)]
*  abuse all the above. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=720.94s)]
*  I think it can all happen. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=722.3399999999999s)]
*  If it does, we get our country back on track. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=723.62s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wkkEHHiFk&t=726.42s)]
