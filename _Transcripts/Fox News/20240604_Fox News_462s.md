# ‘CAMOUFLAGE’: Biden, Democrats have ‘fake messaging’ for the election
**Fox News:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ)
*  All right, tonight more bad news from Biden's border crisis and unvetted Biden illegal immigrant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  from Venezuela shot two New York City police officers in Queens, New York. The suspect [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=8.08s)]
*  crossed the border in July of 2023. Who should we blame the most? I would say Joe Biden, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=13.36s)]
*  the same guy that lied to you for three years saying over and over as the borders closed, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=20.64s)]
*  secure. Here's a simple fact that Biden would probably like you to ignore. In his first hundred [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=25.52s)]
*  days in office, Joe Biden reversed nearly every single one of Donald Trump's safety measures [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  with the stroke of a pen. As a result of that stupidity, well, the predictable chaos ensued [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=37.2s)]
*  and more than 10 million unvetted Biden illegal immigrants and counting have now poured into our [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=43.36s)]
*  country. Many from, let's see, places like China, tens of thousands of them, and Russia and Egypt [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=49.36s)]
*  and Afghanistan and Iran and Syria and Yemen and Kazakhstan. And I can go on. And by the way, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=56.16s)]
*  for a while, Biden just kept lying to you, the American people telling you that Congress could, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=62.96s)]
*  only Congress could reverse this terrible border policy that he himself reversed with the stroke [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  of a pen. But with the election right nearby, 154 days away, it's time for an election year conversion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=74.0s)]
*  And now Joe is planning later this week, a new executive order to finally address the crisis [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=81.6s)]
*  that he himself created. By the way, spoiler alert, it's little more than an absolute failure [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  and a political ploy on his part. In the meantime, Biden granted a kind of makeshift mass amnesty [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=94.8s)]
*  without us watching to 350,000 illegal immigrants, according to data gathered by the New York Post. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=101.68s)]
*  Oh, amnesty, something of great value. Hope you'll vote for us. Anyway, here now with reaction, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=109.04s)]
*  Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us. So it's even worse than we thought. Now we're basically allowing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=114.4s)]
*  the people to stay in the country. And on top of it, we're not even paying attention where it's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  coming from. But here's the sinister part of this. He was saying, trying to blame Republicans [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=127.52s)]
*  after telling the country alive for three years, the border's secure. Then he said, well, Republicans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  won't sign the bill that would have allowed at least 5,000 unvetted illegals a day, under his [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=137.28s)]
*  plan. And then when they wouldn't go along with it, now he's saying, you know what, I'm going to go [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=143.68s)]
*  back to what Trump did and I'll use the stroke of a pen and I'll fix it. Although I said I wasn't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=147.6s)]
*  allowed to do that. Can you explain that? Well, I can. This is the latest incarnation of what I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=152.8s)]
*  call election year camouflage, which is the Democrats, especially Joe Biden, but all the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=158.56s)]
*  Democrats, they think the voters are stupid. And so they do. You remember before the 2022 election, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  right before the election, Joe Biden released a bunch of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=168.08s)]
*  and it ended up causing gasoline prices to drop a little bit. And they think the voters are stupid. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=173.12s)]
*  They don't notice that gas prices have skyrocketed. If they get a little bit of a drop, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=177.52s)]
*  they say, look, aren't things great? Or the student loan forgiveness where he gives away, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=181.28s)]
*  or he says he's giving away a trillion dollars right before the election, trying to convince a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=186.0s)]
*  bunch of young people, hey, look at all this free stuff I'm giving, just vote for the Democrats. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=190.4s)]
*  Now, of course, he knew it would be struck down by the courts and it was in this instance on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=194.48s)]
*  immigration. Tomorrow, Joe Biden is going to, it didn't stop them, but, but, but it's all about [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=198.72s)]
*  fake messaging for the election. This immigration order that's coming tomorrow, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=204.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's going to stand up and say, we're securing the border. And you know what? I'm going [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=210.32s)]
*  to predict in the next five months, we're actually going to see the border numbers go down a little [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=214.32s)]
*  bit. Now don't be deceived by that. It's just like the gasoline prices going down a little bit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=218.72s)]
*  They're doing this right before the election. They're doing it. So the useful idiots in the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  corporate media will say, gosh, Biden solved the problem. Nothing else to worry about here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=228.24s)]
*  It is entirely fake. And we have had 11 million people invade this country because Joe Biden and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=233.04s)]
*  the Democrats want 11 million people to invade this country. You mentioned the two NYPD police [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=240.32s)]
*  officers that were shot. They were shot by a Venezuelan, a 19 year old named Bernardo [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Raul Castro Mata. I mean, this is a name out of Charles Dickens. Mata is Spanish for he kills. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  The guy's middle name is Raul Castro. He's literally named after a communist murdering [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=260.8s)]
*  dictator. He came from Venezuela. And what did Joe Biden do? Let him go. Let him go. Said, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=266.16s)]
*  you know what? New York City is a great place for you to go. He did. He shot two police officers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  This is what Joe Biden is doing every day. And this executive order, he admits he had the power [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=277.04s)]
*  to do this three and a half years ago, but he didn't do it three and a half years ago. He wants [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=282.8s)]
*  11 million and he wants 20 million and he wants 40 million because he views every one of these as [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=286.56s)]
*  future Democrat voters. Okay. That's the point. You know, they would say, well, Republicans don't [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=291.84s)]
*  want people of color. It's the great replacement theory. I don't care where anybody comes from. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=298.16s)]
*  If you come into the country legally, we have a chance to vet you a couple of things. We need to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=303.36s)]
*  have a security background on you, a health check in light of what happened with COVID. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=308.8s)]
*  And beyond that, a means test to make sure you won't be a financial burden on the American people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=314.24s)]
*  Then Senator, I don't care where you come from. Yes. Welcome to the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=319.04s)]
*  There's a right way to come. But the lie is, but now they're giving amnesty on top of it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=324.72s)]
*  Oh, something of great value, a path to citizenship, which will lead to what? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  I hope you'll vote for us. We're the ones that gave that to you. Meanwhile, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=333.92s)]
*  you know, you'd pay $10 million to get into Australia. Yeah. Look, that's exactly right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=337.68s)]
*  Listen, there is a right way to come. You come legally. As you know, I am the son [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=343.44s)]
*  of a Cuban immigrant. Sean, you know, my dad, my father came in 1957 from Cuba. He had nothing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=348.16s)]
*  He had been in prison. He'd been tortured as a teenager in Cuba. When he came to America, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=354.32s)]
*  he came to Texas. He was 18. He couldn't speak English. He was a teenage immigrant. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=359.04s)]
*  He had a hundred dollars in his underwear. His first job was washing dishes, 50 cents an hour. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=363.76s)]
*  But you know what? He came legally. He got a student visa. He came to go to the University [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=369.2s)]
*  of Texas. He came to work. He ended up getting a job. He started a business today. He's a pastor. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=374.08s)]
*  That's the right way to come. We're a nation of immigrants. We welcome people who come legally, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=379.68s)]
*  but Joe Biden and the Democrats, they don't want legal immigrants where you know their backgrounds. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=385.2s)]
*  They open it up. They invite every murderer, every rapist, every gangbanger, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=389.44s)]
*  every terrorist to flood across the border. And what happened in New York this week, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=393.76s)]
*  the two police officers shot. That is happening every single week. People being shot and killed [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=398.64s)]
*  by illegal immigrants. Joe Biden and the Democrats have released. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=406.56s)]
*  He has blood on his hands. And when some of these people from either China or Russia or Iran or [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=410.24s)]
*  Syria or Yemen or Egypt or Afghanistan or Kazakhstan, you know, one of those terror cells, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=417.76s)]
*  which I'm pretty certain are here. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=424.24s)]
*  They are. They tragically are. And the FBI is telling us they're here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=427.28s)]
*  So it's a matter of when, not if. Yes. And how sad is that? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=432.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there'll be a lot of dead Americans and they'll have blood on their hands. And you [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=438.4s)]
*  know what? It's unforgivable. It's a clear and present danger and it's unnecessary. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=442.32s)]
*  Senator Cruz, thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U302PvE6rjQ&t=447.76s)]
