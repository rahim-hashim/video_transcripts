# They’re using asylum to ‘mass release’ people: Rep. Chip Roy
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck)
*  The Biden administration won't say, because the information they claim could be exploited [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=0.0s)]
*  by bad actors. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=5.44s)]
*  That's you, by the way. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=6.44s)]
*  The taxpayers are bad actors. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=8.08s)]
*  We also reached out to DHS for further clarity. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=9.56s)]
*  No response from them yet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=12.44s)]
*  Joining us now, Texas Congressman Chip Roy and Chad Wolf, former acting DHS secretary [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=14.08s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=18.36s)]
*  Congressman, do you get the sense that the Biden administration is preparing to bring [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=19.84s)]
*  in hundreds of thousands of Haitians into the United States? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=25.72s)]
*  Well, good evening, Laura. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=28.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no question about it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=29.96s)]
*  You just mentioned that we had 133,000, I think, Haitians. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=31.76s)]
*  But what the American people don't, I think, fully understand is the extent to which radical [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=35.52s)]
*  progressive Democrats, led by Biden, led by Alejandro Mayorkas, are releasing large numbers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=39.08s)]
*  of people into the United States purposely, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=45.56s)]
*  In total violation of the law, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  They're using parole. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  They're using asylum to mass release. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I think the number now is somewhere around four and a half million people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=52.96s)]
*  Now you're seeing this 133,000 from Haiti, where you've got now roving gangs running [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  around the island, engaging in cannibalistic activity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=61.36s)]
*  These are all law-abiding people coming into the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, and this is the joke, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=66.56s)]
*  You've got Democrats will go to the floor like Jim McGovern, and they'll go down there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  and they'll say, Republicans own this now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=73.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Because they put their fake bill over in the Senate. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  The fact is, this president, these radical progressive Democrats, they want to remake [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=78.14s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=82.34s)]
*  We have 50 million foreign born. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=83.34s)]
*  They want to dump a whole lot of folks in this country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=85.0s)]
*  You want to know what Venezuela's crime is going down? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=87.16s)]
*  Because the criminals are now here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're the best thing that ever happened in Venezuela. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Chad, what's the potential danger here for this country? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the danger is allowing all these individuals come in that aren't vetted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  You don't know who they are, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=98.28s)]
*  And so if you're paroling upwards to 300,000 folks every year— [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  That means releasing into the country, but people don't know their immigration lingo. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you parole, you release them into American—or either asylum, you release them [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=105.32s)]
*  into American communities. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=108.8s)]
*  Either way, you're releasing hundreds of thousands and millions of folks into American [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=109.8s)]
*  communities, and you don't—they're not properly vetted. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  You don't know who they are. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=116.04s)]
*  And so whether they're public safety threats, like we saw, obviously, with Lake and Riley, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=117.4s)]
*  or they're national security threats, you have an issue here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  And you can't continue to sustain this type of—these types of numbers and really understand [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  who they are. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=130.0s)]
*  It's an invasion of America. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, people think, well, you can't say that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=132.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=133.88s)]
*  It is an invasion of America that's greenlit by this administration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=134.88s)]
*  Congressman, a Biden Pentagon official testified about the coming migrant crisis from Haiti [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=136.84s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=142.12s)]
*  We have not yet seen large numbers, what we would characterize as a maritime mass migration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=143.68s)]
*  We are alert to that possibility. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=150.0s)]
*  I think you're right that the driving conditions in Haiti could very well press more people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=158.12s)]
*  I mean, that's why—you might as well just have a banner. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=159.84s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands are coming here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and this is exactly right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=163.32s)]
*  It's not reassuring. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=164.32s)]
*  And Governor Abbott in Texas has been responding to this invasion by putting up wire. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=165.32s)]
*  Obviously, this administration is trying to fight him on it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=169.16s)]
*  Activated another 250 of their law enforcement personnel and their National Guard to go deal [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  with what they're going to deal with now because of Haitian boats coming there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=176.28s)]
*  We intercepted that, I think, 24 just yesterday. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  And Chad just said that you can, unlike when at the border where they can just come in, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=181.68s)]
*  what can happen when you try to come in on a maritime— [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Coast Guard can turn you around. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=188.12s)]
*  So they can intercept on the sea, and they can return them back to Haiti. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that this Coast Guard under Biden will do that? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=193.08s)]
*  Well, that is the law. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=195.56s)]
*  I mean, that is how they operate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=196.56s)]
*  That doesn't matter. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=197.56s)]
*  That doesn't matter one bit. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=198.56s)]
*  That is how they're supposed to operate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=199.56s)]
*  We've seen them do it over the last couple of years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=201.44s)]
*  Now, it's different if you have a mass migration, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=203.04s)]
*  If you're talking about hundreds and thousands of boats. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=205.76s)]
*  And that's a different issue. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=208.72s)]
*  Now, the three of us have been on this immigration issue, you in official capacity, but Congressman [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=210.0s)]
*  Roy and I for decades on what's happened on immigration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=214.76s)]
*  Do you think in many ways this will eclipse even the economic nightmare that Biden has [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=219.34s)]
*  created for the regular person out there who feels like, you know, they can't get a break, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=224.94s)]
*  that all these people are being waved in and they get to go to public schools, health care, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  like all the rest of the thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=233.64s)]
*  Not that it's perfect when they come here, but they do get a lot of benefits. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=234.64s)]
*  Do you think that's almost going to eclipse the economy in some ways? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=237.6s)]
*  I think all the polling indicates that right now nationwide. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=241.32s)]
*  I can tell you anecdotally in Texas, that's a certainty. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  I can also tell you that we have Democrat colleagues who will whisper to us, hey, you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=246.64s)]
*  know, Lakin Riley is now becoming essentially George Floyd towards us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  They're feeling it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  I know they're feeling it in Georgia because frankly, they saw what happened because, let's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  be very clear here, directly as a result of the mass releases of individuals through El [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=259.16s)]
*  Paso, through parole, violating the law, this individual was released into this country, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=263.20000000000005s)]
*  went to New York, went to Georgia and killed Lakin Riley. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=267.56s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=269.8s)]
*  Well, how many crimes? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=270.8s)]
*  We don't even know how many crimes, Chad, have been committed by illegals because they [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=271.8s)]
*  never like to actually give you the information. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  The immigration detainers are never lodged. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=277.56s)]
*  We never know. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  And they just get circulated in and out of the system, as this guy did. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=283.6s)]
*  And a lot of the stats and statistics out there don't actually categorize the folks as illegal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=284.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=289.88s)]
*  So you'll see the crime, but you don't know if they're illegal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=290.88s)]
*  They're here in the U.S. legally, maybe a permanent resident or the like. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  And so it's very difficult to actually get the real stats on how many crimes are committed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=295.68s)]
*  by illegal aliens. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  And this was a family of killers. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  The Yabardas were a family of killers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  You got the DUIs, you got the other robberies, you know, assaults. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=303.08s)]
*  So this is passed down from brother to brother here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=307.4s)]
*  No question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=310.52s)]
*  When we're talking about this, we have this case with Lakin Riley's killer, but also [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=311.52s)]
*  a Venezuelan that was engaged with a two-year-old killed right here in Montgomery County. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=314.0s)]
*  Northern Virginia is teeming and Montgomery County, they were all worried about COVID. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=318.16s)]
*  It was going to kill everybody. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=322.92s)]
*  But now we got MS-13 crawling around Montgomery County and the liberals of Montgomery County [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=324.48s)]
*  going, welcome in, bienvenidos. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=328.92s)]
*  Like I love Spanish-speaking people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=330.54s)]
*  I love Spanish. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=331.8s)]

*  It's happening in every state. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZVuhjnycck&t=353.44s)]
