# Stephen Miller: Biden is decaying before our eyes
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g)
*  Jason Schaffetz, the host of Tommy Lahren is fearless on outkick. Tommy Lahren, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=0.0s)]
*  former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Tommy, I don't know what to make of this. The fact that the media mob now is put in a position, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=9.92s)]
*  they have no choice. They now have to report that which I was reporting before the 2020 election, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  which has gotten progressively and frankly dramatically worse. And that is Joe Biden [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=23.84s)]
*  being weak and frail and a cognitive mess. Now they have to cover it and the Biden White House, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=29.2s)]
*  they're furious that the truth is being told. I don't think it's going to work. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=36.4s)]
*  I don't know if it's that they have to cover it or now they've been given permission [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  to cover it. I would believe that actually the Democrat Party has given the media a little bit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=48.48s)]
*  of a pass and said, all right, we want this guy out. So now you can take the gloves off. You can [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  take off the kitty gloves and you can actually question this president. You can question his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  cognitive, physical, mental abilities. I think even when we're seeing Joe Biden walking with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=65.28s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, I would not be surprised if Nancy Pelosi didn't pull him aside and say, now is the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  time to step down gracefully or at least not run again. I think him being in California to me, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=76.32s)]
*  that says everything I need to know. I think Gavin Newsom is getting ready. I think the media [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=82.24s)]
*  is getting ready. We're heading into the spring. Wait till we head into the summer. Joe Biden might [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  be white knuckling this, holding on to his power because of his ego. But if the Democrat Party and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=91.6s)]
*  those who really run it say it's time to go, Joe, it will be time to go, Joe. You know, Jason, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  when Joe had to give up the big boy steps to get up Air Force One for the little baby steps [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=104.16s)]
*  and Joe got his new sneakers, they thought that, I guess they thought that was going to work. Now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  they have a Secret Service agent, I guess, ready to help him if God forbid he falls or stumbles yet [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=115.44s)]
*  again. But if he can't make it up the baby steps of Air Force One and he really gave up the big [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  boy steps on Air Force One, that's a pretty big problem. That poor Secret Service agent, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=128.0s)]
*  I feel for him because you know he's nervous that the president's going to come tumbling down on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=135.28s)]
*  him. Look, I worry about that thick grass on the south lawn of the White House. I think Joe Biden, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=139.92s)]
*  with new sneakers, they're evidently thicker and bigger. He's going to go tumbling. And I think [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  the big event is actually going to be on March 7th, the State of the Union. You know, he's used [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=151.36s)]
*  to a teleprompter. It's about the size of the Jumbotron there where the Dallas Cowboys, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=156.48s)]
*  play their games. That thing is huge. He's going to have to have two little teleprompters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=163.44s)]
*  and he better give an hour's worth of speech. And I don't know that he can make it up those steps, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  even getting on the dais there in the House of Representatives. So any moment everybody's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=172.88s)]
*  watching, he's going for a fall. You just know it's going to happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Stephen Miller, maybe President Trump can find a pair, an extra pair of that sold out sneaker [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=182.24s)]
*  line that he released over the weekend. I know it's sold out. I know they're selling for big [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=189.76s)]
*  prices on eBay. Maybe those sneakers would help. Maybe he needs to change the sneaker he's using [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=196.16s)]
*  again. Sadly, Joe Biden's decline is so pronounced, not even a pair of Trump sneakers can save this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=201.84s)]
*  man. It gets worse every week, every single day. The physical decline, the cognitive decline, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=210.8s)]
*  the decline in appearance, in vibrancy, in dynamism. He's literally decaying before our eyes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=218.08s)]
*  And that is why the Democrat Party is in a state of panic. They are trapped. Joe Biden is unwilling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=225.28s)]
*  to step aside. He spent his entire life dreaming of nothing else but being president since he was a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  little kid, his entire career, and he's not going to let this go. They're going to have to grab it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=237.2s)]
*  out of his hands. And yet they know the American public has already made up its mind. Joe Biden is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=242.48s)]
*  too frail. Joe Biden is too weak. Joe Biden is too confused. The idea that the most powerful nation [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=248.16s)]
*  in the world has a president that our friend and foe alike understand has senile dementia is a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  national security threat. And of all of the vulnerabilities the Democrats face heading into [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=262.8s)]
*  November, and it is a long list, inflation, war raging around the world, a wide open southern border, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=267.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's radical mental incapacity has surely become one of the absolute top issues on the minds [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=275.12s)]
*  of all American voters. You know, Tommy, let me go back to you. You mentioned the name Gavin Newsom. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  I had two interviews with him myself. He had his debate with Governor DeSantis right here on this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=288.4s)]
*  program. I mean, he has been adamant that he is not going to run under any circumstances. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=293.84s)]
*  And even when as far as to say that, in fact, there would be Vice President Harris that is up next, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=300.64s)]
*  not him. And then he also then followed up with free health care for illegal immigrants in California, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=307.44s)]
*  the sanctuary state. Not exactly a popular issue if you want to ever move to the center in a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=314.8s)]
*  presidential election year. No, but you seem to think it's Gavin, right? Well, I believe it's going [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=320.32s)]
*  to be Gavin. And if you recall during the Democrat debates, every Democrat raised their hand when [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=329.04s)]
*  they talked about giving health care to illegals and allowing basically illegal immigration. So I [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  don't think that that's going to be as much of a problem as the fact that his state is going to have [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=337.68s)]
*  a huge budget shortfall. But it really doesn't matter because right now they have Joe Biden who [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=341.2s)]
*  can't get a sentence out. So Gavin Newsom with his age and his charisma is going to look a lot [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=346.64s)]
*  better to voters, especially low information voters than Joe Biden ever would. Gavin Newsom [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=351.28s)]
*  is the saving grace. I know he said over and over again that he's not running, but have you ever [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=356.24s)]
*  known a Democrat to be straightforward? If he can use this and say that he's doing it for the good [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=360.4s)]
*  of the country and the good of the party, he will absolutely step into those shoes. They will get [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=365.36s)]
*  Kamala out of the way. Gavin Newsom is ambitious. He always has been. Watch Gavin Newsom. Put a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=370.0s)]
*  tracker on Gavin Newsom like they do Taylor Swift's private jet. You'll see this man is already [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=375.84s)]
*  running a shadow campaign and he will be the nominee. I still maintain that. Listen, you may [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=380.56s)]
*  very well be right, Jason. I mean, he's been pretty adamant to me. I'm not sure what to make of it, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=386.56s)]
*  but for him to even go as far as to say VP Harris would be up before him and you would have to move [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=391.44s)]
*  the vice president out of the way. I don't think that's an easy task. An African American woman [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=399.36s)]
*  being passed over for a liberal white male in California, especially considering the identity [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  politics that drives the Democratic Party. How would that go over? I don't think I think they [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=413.92s)]
*  put themselves in a box. They didn't say they were going to put up the most competent person. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  They said they were going to put up the person who looks a certain way. It is so fundamentally [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=425.2s)]
*  wrong who we are as Americans. And hey, if you're going to go all that way, why don't you put up [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=429.12s)]
*  Adam Schiff as your nominee? Maybe Eric Swalwell could be the vice president. Maybe they could get [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=433.68s)]
*  Fang Fang to be their chief fundraiser. I mean, Democrats just go all in. Be all California. Go [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=439.28s)]
*  for it. You want Fang Fang as VP? Wow. I thought I thought I was good in the humor department [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=444.96s)]
*  tonight. I think you're out doing me. Chief fundraiser, chief fundraiser. All right. So [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=450.96s)]
*  Stephen Miller, I've had many people because I do three hours of radio. We do this TV show every [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  night. Now people are beginning to tell me, Hannity, you've got to stop. Don't talk about [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=460.56s)]
*  it anymore. Don't point it out anymore because they want him to be on the ticket. They think he's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=466.32s)]
*  the easiest to beat. And I'm like, I have a job to do. I got to tell people the truth. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Where do you see this going? Do you think they that Joe Biden gets pushed out? Does he quote [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=477.12s)]
*  voluntarily move aside? Do you see that scenario unfolding? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=482.0s)]
*  Well, I think the way Joe Biden's mind works, I mean, to the extent that it works at all, of course, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  the more that people justly criticize his age, the more stubborn he gets, the more he digs in. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=493.84s)]
*  Look at that angry press conference. The more that it's called out, the more that he insists [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=500.64s)]
*  against all evidence and all reason that he's still with it, that he doesn't have diminished [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=505.52s)]
*  faculty. So far from causing him to bow out, it causes him to entrench. I just want to pick up on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  the point that was made earlier about the Kamala Harris problem. They are completely trapped. There [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=515.12s)]
*  is no way around the fact that if they ditch Biden, they're stuck with a vice president who [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=522.8s)]
*  is historically unpopular and comically incompetent. And so they have no way, you know, they wanted to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=528.24s)]
*  glide down to Gavin Newsom. So there really is no clean way for them out of this box that they have [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=535.92s)]
*  gotten themselves into. Of course, that is the reason why Joe Biden is so intent on staying in, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=542.64s)]
*  because I'm sure even in his diminished state, he understands that they have no way around [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=548.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris. So for the time being, the Democrat Party is totally trapped. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=554.0s)]
*  Exit question predictions. We start with Tommy. I think I know your answer. You're [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=560.24s)]
*  in the Gavin Newsom camp who will be on the ticket for the Democrats come November. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=565.04s)]
*  I believe it's going to be Newsom Trump and to that Kamala Harris point. I'm not sure she [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=572.48s)]
*  entirely wants to be president. Her actions wouldn't indicate it. They can get her out of the way. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=577.12s)]
*  Don't underestimate a Democrat. It's going to be Gavin. Jason, who's it going to be? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=581.68s)]
*  I think Barack Obama makes this decision and he goes to the person that he likes the most. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=588.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's Susan Rice. Wow. Interesting. Nobody else has brought that up before. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=593.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller, you get the last word. I'm going to be in the minority here. I'm going to say [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=599.12s)]
*  it's going to be Biden. He is not going to let it go even as he decomposes in real time. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLbL6OCrb1g&t=604.64s)]
