# Vivek Ramaswamy: This is a new Republican Party and a new country
**Fox News:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E)
*  24 presidential candidate, the vague, Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=0.0s)]
*  You, sir, were not wrong. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=3.36s)]
*  You were predicting this victory by this margin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=4.86s)]
*  And you even brought up—and I had brought it up on my radio show a number of times—the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=9.48s)]
*  idea of him winning the popular vote, which happened as well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's from traveling this country, Sean, we get out of the echo chambers on the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  internet and just talk to people from Pennsylvania to Iowa to the West Coast of Nevada. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=23.0s)]
*  We found that most Americans share the same common values. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=28.58s)]
*  It was a beautiful thing to watch last night. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=32.26s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a couple good things to come out of it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=33.66s)]
*  Number one is I think we're going to see a resurgence of national unity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=36.4s)]
*  Young people coming along in droves for Republicans. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=39.82s)]
*  This is a new coalition. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=42.96s)]
*  This is a new Republican Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=43.96s)]
*  This is a new country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  The other positive thing as a result of that, I think we're going to see, Sean, is a Democratic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=47.16s)]
*  Party that at least finds its way back to sanity. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  One of two things is going to happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=54.459999999999994s)]
*  Either the Democratic Party is going to have to let go of the crazies on the progressive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  left and find its North Star again, or else the Democratic Party is dead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  In either way, that's a good win for the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  So we're still learning a lot from those election results, but the number one learning is there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=65.84s)]
*  is a new coalition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=69.84s)]
*  We're united and there's unity to save this country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  And I'm excited that we're going to be a part of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=74.22s)]
*  Isn't it really—and I've been saying this for some time—that the Democratic Party [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=76.68s)]
*  has become the party of coastal elites? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have these last-minute ads. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=83.1s)]
*  Julia Roberts, tell your husband you're voting for Trump, but you can go in and nobody [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=85.3s)]
*  will know how you really vote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=90.36s)]
*  You can then come out and lie to your husband, did you vote the right way, honey? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=91.82s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  And you know, you could be a real man and tell your bro friends that you voted for Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=97.14s)]
*  and you really voted for Kamala. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=102.82s)]
*  If you have to hide, if you have to pretend that you don't want to tell your friends [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=104.66s)]
*  who you really voted for, maybe that's not the right person to be voting for. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, the reality is this is just the politics of division that the Democrats have been perpetuating [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  for a really long time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  It started with identity politics based on race, then gender, then sexuality, now division, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=122.94s)]
*  even trying to sow that within the family, within married members of the same household [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=128.26s)]
*  relationship. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=132.34s)]
*  And it didn't work. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=133.34s)]
*  So I think the beautiful thing about this, Sean, is now that we've defeated Kamala Harris [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=134.34s)]
*  and Joe Biden and that Democratic machine, we don't have to worry about them and their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  hypocrisies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=141.94000000000003s)]
*  Now we can move forward and say, we're not just running from something. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=143.18s)]
*  We're now running to something. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  I like Donald Trump's message in the closing speech last night, celebration victory party [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=148.02s)]
*  at 2 33 a.m. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=152.18s)]
*  Yesterday, what do you have to say is we're entering a new golden age in America. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  And I think this is the opportunity we now have. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=157.9s)]
*  The other side has been so thoroughly defeated that they're going to have to go figure out [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=160.22000000000003s)]
*  who they are and what they stand for. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=163.74s)]
*  That's on our job. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  Our job is to now revive this country for all Americans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=166.62s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump's going to be able to do it by uniting people through success. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=170.1s)]
*  It was a beautiful message. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=174.22s)]
*  You've been a successful businessman and you've been out on the campaign trail. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=176.18s)]
*  Would you be willing to give up that successful career and go into the president's cabinet [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=181.5s)]
*  of asked? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=187.3s)]
*  Look, I've lived the American dream, Sean. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=188.3s)]
*  I'm doing this now for my kids and their generation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  That's why I stepped into this fear last year when I ran for president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  I want to serve this country in the biggest way I possibly can. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  And because Donald Trump delivered that decisive victory, he's also assembled this coalition [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=201.05999999999997s)]
*  of outsiders and independent thinkers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=205.7s)]
*  And I think because of that victory, we're going to have some big ways to change the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=207.94s)]
*  country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  Whatever role I can play, I'm looking forward to it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  OK, whatever role I can play is that a yes that you would you'd leave the private sector? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=213.98s)]
*  I'm excited to serve the country, Sean, and in a big way. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, once we make some decisions, we've got some great paths ahead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=222.94s)]
*  You've given me a politician's answer. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=225.74s)]
*  I know you well enough. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=228.14s)]
*  Now, would you be willing to serve in the cabinet? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=229.9s)]
*  Why are you making me do this again? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=232.7s)]
*  I'll be willing to serve this country in a big way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=234.62s)]
*  I promise you that, Sean. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnjitAv28E&t=236.9s)]
