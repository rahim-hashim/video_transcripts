# Stephen A. Smith: This shows how detached Democrats are
**Fox News:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI)
*  All right, it is no secret the Democratic Party is struggling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=0.0s)]
*  The latest survey from Navigator Research, which says its mission is to, quote, develop [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=5.12s)]
*  winning progressive messages. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=10.84s)]
*  It found a whopping 70 percent of voters in swing congressional districts believe the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Democrats are too focused on political correctness. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=18.2s)]
*  Fifty-one percent believe that they are the elitist party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=21.84s)]
*  I've been saying this forever. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=24.28s)]
*  Republican parties become the party of working men and women. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=25.92s)]
*  They are the coastal elites, the party of coastal elites. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=29.2s)]
*  And of course, they could call in some outside help, someone like our friend Stephen A. Smith [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=32.44s)]
*  to take a look at—let's take a look at what he had to say on The View, that hard-hitting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=37.76s)]
*  new show, The Ladies of The View, last week. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=42.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=44.84s)]
*  Because in the end, if you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony counts or [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=45.84s)]
*  34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it's not about him winning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=52.0s)]
*  There was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=57.04s)]
*  to American citizens. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=60.16s)]
*  We might sit up there and talk about, hey, you should be a party for the working class, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  which the Democratic Party was once known for. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=65.08s)]
*  They're not known for that right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=67.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=68.6s)]
*  Because their message was catering towards others and towards other issues, and they [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=69.6s)]
*  forgot about the people that brought them there that elevated the Democratic Party to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=72.48s)]
*  what it was over these last few decades. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=75.72s)]
*  That's why they lost. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=78.16s)]
*  He didn't win. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=79.16s)]
*  The Democrats lost. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=80.16s)]
*  Well, let's remind people— [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=81.16s)]
*  Yeah, they wouldn't even stand or clap for no tax on tips, Social Security or overtime. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=82.16s)]
*  That's for working men and women. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=87.0s)]
*  Here with more, he's the star of ESPN's first take, Stephen A— [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=88.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=92.96s)]
*  That background is your background. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=95.24s)]
*  You put—you can't help yourself. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  You are loving this attention. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Oh, is Stephen A running for president? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=103.72s)]
*  Is Stephen—oh, I'm not going to fuel the fire by putting the White House behind me [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  on a television hit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=111.28s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=113.08s)]
*  Sean Hannity. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=114.08s)]
*  All I have to say is this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=115.2s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=117.08s)]
*  And God bless the United States of America. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=118.08s)]
*  God bless you, too. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=119.08s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=120.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=121.08s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=122.08s)]
*  What's up? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=123.08s)]
*  I appreciate—you're not running for president. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=124.08s)]
*  I don't care what—you make too much money. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=127.0s)]
*  You're not doing it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=128.92s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=130.16s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=131.16s)]
*  You said you're not going to run, but you gave me a political answer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=132.16s)]
*  All right, let me ask you this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=134.12s)]
*  So you're never going to convince the ladies of the view. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=135.76s)]
*  You're never going to convince this party to stop—they had a chance to stand up for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=139.4s)]
*  women's sports last week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=144.68s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  They have a chance to stand against—for the safety of Americans over the rights of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=147.68s)]
*  illegals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=153.0s)]
*  They're not going to do it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=154.0s)]
*  They're going to shut down the government or threatening to shut it down this week. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=155.0s)]
*  That's your party, Stephen A. It's been radicalized. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=157.4s)]
*  And why you remain a part of it, I don't know. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=160.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't consider myself a part of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=162.68s)]
*  I'm very ashamed of what I've seen from them over the last several years, and I've stated [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=166.08s)]
*  that in front of your face and that of many others on many occasions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  And I thought that the behavior of some of—not all, but some of the Democrats during Trump's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=172.76s)]
*  speech to both houses last week was disgraceful. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  I thought that Representative Green— [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=181.44s)]
*  Some? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=183.32s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=184.32s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=185.32s)]
*  Let me challenge you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=186.32s)]
*  Some? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=187.32s)]
*  Who stood for the First Lady? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=188.32s)]
*  Who stood for Lincoln Riley's mother? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=189.32s)]
*  Who stood for— [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=190.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=191.32s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=192.32s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=193.32s)]
*  I was just talking about Representative Green getting put out and then censured. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=194.32s)]
*  I was talking about them not standing for Lincoln Riley. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=198.12s)]
*  I was talking about them not standing for the young boy that was a cancer patient. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=200.88s)]
*  I mean, my God. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=204.12s)]
*  It's just absolutely pathetic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=205.12s)]
*  But I didn't see several of the representatives. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  For example, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, he would sit there and what have you and conduct [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=209.68s)]
*  himself professionally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=214.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, we didn't see that from too many people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=215.88s)]
*  He never stood for any of them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=218.88s)]
*  I don't know who the hell—that's fair, that's fair, but I don't know who the hell came up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=219.88s)]
*  with the dancing videos. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who the hell came up with, you know, 22 representatives at the same time [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=223.92s)]
*  saying the same message, nothing innovative, nothing authentic whatsoever. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=229.68s)]
*  It was just the same old same old. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  It was an absolute disgrace. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=235.36s)]
*  I don't know who came up with that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=236.8s)]
*  Then you have to take into consideration some of the other things that we were seeing from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=238.24s)]
*  them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=242.0s)]
*  And in the end, it just shows how detached they are. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=243.0s)]
*  But here's why there is hope, Sean Hannity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you why there's hope. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=248.88s)]
*  Because you got people like me, and I don't think that I'm alone, that's ready to purge [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=251.24s)]
*  the damn party. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=255.44s)]
*  What we've been seeing from them, it doesn't resonate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not working any longer. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=259.6s)]
*  We're not falling for the okie doke. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=261.12s)]
*  We're not buying what they're selling. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=262.24s)]
*  And at the end of the day, they've got to stand up, step up and show that they're ready [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  to do the job that folks sent them to the nation's capital to do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's work with whatever administration is in office. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  I know they don't like the fact that Donald Trump is in office, but the 47th president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  of the United States of America, his name is Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=280.24s)]
*  And as you have told me, on many occasions, if nothing else, the man is all about making [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=284.12s)]
*  deals. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=290.04s)]
*  Find deals that he's willing to make and make it happen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=291.04s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=295.16s)]
*  You want to admit that I was right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=296.16s)]
*  Was I right about Zelensky? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=297.16s)]
*  And I'm going to be right about these trade deals. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=298.16s)]
*  He's going to be successful there too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=300.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, I didn't say you were wrong. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=302.68s)]
*  See, this is how you misquote me and misrepresent me to your audience right there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=304.96s)]
*  All the conservatives out there who actually love me, I don't know if you noticed, but [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=308.4s)]
*  they got love for me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=311.6s)]
*  They don't love you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=312.6s)]
*  They tolerate you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  You're not telling the truth about what happened. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  I thought he was going to end up being right about Zelensky because Zelensky had, Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=316.36s)]
*  was right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=322.8s)]
*  He didn't have the cards. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=323.8s)]
*  As I had said on the Stephen A. Smith show, you don't have any cash. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=324.8s)]
*  I just didn't like the way he acts. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  What you do is you know the end result because you communicate with him all the time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=330.24s)]
*  You got inside information. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=334.36s)]
*  The problem is the American public out there doesn't know what you know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=335.92s)]
*  We have to lean on his behavior, the things that he says, and it scares the living hell [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=339.76000000000005s)]

*  You have a good time because you know that at the end of the day, you're going to be [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=345.9s)]
*  right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=348.74s)]
*  You actually sit back and wait for these people to say these things on these other networks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=349.74s)]
*  You don't know who I talk to. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=353.74s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=354.74s)]
*  I talk to you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=355.74s)]
*  You only know what I talk to you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=356.74s)]
*  But look, this is now without— [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=357.74s)]
*  I just know how connected you are. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=358.74s)]
*  I know how connected you are. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=359.74s)]
*  The Democrats are going to show up with the little bingo paddles. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=360.74s)]
*  They won't stand for mothers that lost their children. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=365.94s)]
*  Which was embarrassing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=367.94s)]
*  Or a 12-year-old young man that beat his battle with cancer. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=368.94s)]
*  Totally right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=372.66s)]
*  Or the wife of a slave officer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=373.66s)]
*  So they got their bingo paddles. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=375.66s)]
*  They won't even stand for working men and women. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=378.3s)]
*  No tax on tips, Social Security. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=380.86s)]
*  No tax on overtime. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=383.1s)]
*  I used to be a working man and woman, if you will. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=384.58s)]
*  I was the forgotten man, if you will. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=388.02s)]
*  I worked in the service industry and restaurants. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=391.22s)]
*  I worked in construction. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=393.74s)]
*  You know my background. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=395.14s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=396.7s)]
*  One of the many problems with the Democratic Party, outside of not being known as the party [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=400.14s)]
*  that caters to the working class, outside of being known as the party that leaned so [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=406.54s)]
*  far left you, made Trump seem normal, outside of all of those things. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=410.46s)]
*  Here's the ultimate crime that's going on. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=414.58s)]
*  They're literally sitting up on Capitol Hill, not all, but most of them, they're the party. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=417.9s)]
*  They're literally sitting up on Capitol Hill acting like their only job is to be in opposite [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=423.26s)]
*  of Donald Trump in every way, shape, form, and fashion. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=429.38s)]
*  That's not going to get them the midterms. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=432.46s)]
*  That's not going to help them regain the White House. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=435.17999999999995s)]
*  It's fool's gold. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=438.38s)]
*  And somebody needs to tell them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to tell them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=441.17999999999995s)]
*  I don't think I'm alone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  But when the conservatives like yourself and various others are uttering this stuff, it [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  pains me to say, you're right, and they better do something about it because in the end, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=449.14s)]
*  and Lord help them, if the terror situation works in Trump's favor, they're really not [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  going to have a leg to stand on then. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  Lord help them if that happens. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=460.1s)]
*  Let me tell you, I think one of the most vicious, vile things that is happening now is what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=462.1s)]
*  they're doing to Elon Musk. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you think, is there one thing, is one thing bad that this guy's done in your mind? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=468.26s)]
*  One thing that deserves assassination attempts and shooting at his, at his dealerships and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=472.82s)]
*  burning his charging stations and boycotting and trying to hurt his business and all he's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=478.7s)]
*  done is saved American taxpayers hundreds of billions. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=483.42s)]
*  You agree that that's a good thing, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=486.38s)]
*  Well, I agree that that's a good thing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  But let's be very clear about something here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  We never condone violence. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=492.61999999999995s)]
*  We never condone miscreants. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, I'm not. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, damn it, I'm not. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=498.7s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=499.97999999999996s)]
*  I can tell you that much. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=500.7s)]
*  No, people don't have any business accurate. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=501.78s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  You have to appreciate and understand he's not an elected official, nor is he somebody [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=504.94s)]
*  that had to go through Senate confirmation hearings or anything like that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=510.5s)]
*  So when you see what he's doing, you have people looking at him and leaning on the power [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=513.3399999999999s)]
*  of Donald Trump and it scares them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=518.18s)]
*  It scares them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=519.7399999999999s)]
*  It scares. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=521.0999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm scared. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=521.62s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=522.62s)]
*  So woke. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm triggered. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=523.9s)]
*  You know, let me go. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=524.62s)]
*  Well, everybody don't know martial arts like you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  How about that? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=527.9799999999999s)]
*  Everybody don't know martial arts like you, Sean. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=530.06s)]
*  OK, you wouldn't. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  By the way, I don't know what happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=531.66s)]
*  What was up with LeBron? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=532.9799999999999s)]
*  He was getting in your grill. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=535.18s)]
*  What was that? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=536.2199999999999s)]
*  He thought that, you know, he thought that I was insulting his son when in fact, that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=537.3s)]
*  is not what I was doing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=541.54s)]
*  I was getting on him because he had gone through so many things to make, you know, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=543.0600000000001s)]
*  to have a son in the NBA and he was bringing unnecessary attention on his son prematurely. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=548.66s)]
*  In my estimation, he didn't like that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=553.26s)]
*  So he confronted me. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=555.02s)]
*  It's his prerogative. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=555.86s)]
*  He didn't put his hands on me. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=556.86s)]
*  That's all that matters. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=557.74s)]
*  He could feel whatever way he wants to feel. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=558.78s)]
*  I'm going to do my job. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=560.18s)]
*  If I was there, I would have had your back if I was there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=560.98s)]
*  I'm just saying I have plenty of people to have my back. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=564.3s)]
*  It wasn't necessary, but I appreciate it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=567.14s)]
*  I would have had your back. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=569.34s)]
*  All right. By the way, don't ever don't get used to that building behind you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=570.78s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHqfxWQ1HdI&t=573.74s)]
