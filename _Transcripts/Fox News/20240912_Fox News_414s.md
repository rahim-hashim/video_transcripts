# Tomi Lahren: Trump walked into an 'ambush' and 'buzzsaw'
**Fox News:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc)
*  Anyway, joining us now, the host of Outkicks, Tommy Lahren is fearless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tommy Lahren, Fox News contributor, Charlie Hurt, Project 2021 chairman Horace Cooper. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=3.36s)]
*  Tommy, start with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=8.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=10.08s)]
*  You know, the frustrating thing to me—and I went into this last night in detail—is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=11.08s)]
*  all of these major radical left positions she staked out, bills she sponsored, we have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=16.88s)]
*  no idea if she still supports them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=24.68s)]
*  How does ABC Disney not ask those fundamental questions? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=27.02s)]
*  Well, they gave her a pass. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=31.14s)]
*  And I think the reason that Kamala won't answer for her past policy positions and she [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=34.94s)]
*  won't tell us why she has supposedly evolved is because she hasn't evolved. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=39.46s)]
*  I also think she's leaving herself plenty of room, if she were to be elected, to go [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=43.78s)]
*  right back to those radical positions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=48.14s)]
*  You can't believe a thing this woman says. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=50.34s)]
*  If she would have given us some story about her evolution on fracking, her evolution on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=52.6s)]
*  gun confiscation, on Medicare for All, on illegal immigration and being tough on the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=56.94s)]
*  border, then perhaps the American people would somewhat buy it, at least the viewers and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=62.98s)]
*  voters that are still on the fence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=67.74s)]
*  But she didn't have to do any of that, because ABC didn't make her do any of that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=70.22s)]
*  They were in the can for her. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  They actively debated against Donald Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=76.3s)]
*  He walked into an ambush and a buzzsaw. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, he didn't just take the bait. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=81.7s)]
*  He took the whole boat, which is a whole separate conversation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=83.76s)]
*  But Kamala is hiding behind the mainstream media and they will continue to shield and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  coddle her. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  The only thing we can do is play back her own words, as you have expertly done, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  play it on repeat until Election Day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  But she's only Charlie being pragmatic to win the election. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders said that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  Listen to one of our own supporters on that key point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=109.12s)]
*  Look, this is why she lost the debate last night. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=112.64s)]
*  She lost it because the onus was completely on her. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  She's the one that one-third of the American population says they don't know where she [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=118.36s)]
*  stands on things, they don't know enough about her to support her or to make a decision [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=122.84s)]
*  about her. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  And so the onus is entirely on her to make the case why people should trust her. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=128.82s)]
*  And she failed to do it last night. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=134.0s)]
*  She failed to explain to people why she's changed her position on things like fracking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=135.88s)]
*  and Israel and all these other topics. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  She also failed to explain why she has embraced all of these wildly radical positions that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=146.24s)]
*  she now conveniently says she has changed her position on. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=152.52s)]
*  You and I both know that the only reason she's changed her position is because she'll say [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=157.44s)]
*  absolutely anything to get elected. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=161.36s)]
*  And as Tommy just pointed out, all the Trump campaign has to do is run the footage of what [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=164.12s)]
*  she said last night compared to all the footage that she said before, just as you just did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  All you have to do is run that and let her sink herself with her own words in their ads. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=174.84s)]
*  And that's why she lost. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=181.18s)]
*  People don't trust her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  They don't know her. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  The onus is on her. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=184.78s)]
*  And she failed last night. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=186.26s)]
*  You know, I'm looking at — and we'll get into this later in the program, Horace, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=187.56s)]
*  but I'm looking at even The New York Times and Reuters, and I've spoken to a lot of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=191.68s)]
*  pollsters today. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=196.42s)]
*  They said, no change, no real impact here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=198.0s)]
*  And the fact that she was rehearsed, OK, got to give her credit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=203.44s)]
*  She did a little homework, and she got her prepared lines. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=206.54s)]
*  ABC did a horrible job in terms of asking really important pertinent questions that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=209.8s)]
*  the—I think the American people need to know before they start voting and they're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=215.76s)]
*  starting to vote now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=220.04s)]
*  And that, to me, is a colossal failure. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=222.4s)]
*  They're the biggest loser in all of this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=224.6s)]
*  I guess the question I have for you is, you know, if she can't move the ball because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=227.44s)]
*  she can't really speak her true beliefs, how does that end, even though she has all [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  the aid and assistance of the media? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=240.24s)]
*  There's something that happened last night that's actually bigger than the aspirations [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=242.84s)]
*  of former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, and that is that on December [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=249.72s)]
*  15, 1791, our founders got ratified, the First Amendment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=255.4s)]
*  It is the only part of the Constitution that protects a commercial enterprise. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=261.48s)]
*  That is the fifth estate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=268.24s)]
*  And they did that for a really, really important reason. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=270.18s)]
*  When Benjamin Franklin said, we had a republic if we could keep it, it was assumed that the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=274.52s)]
*  media would understand the important role that they have in keeping the American people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=280.2s)]
*  informed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=288.24s)]
*  They're not supposed to be cheerleaders and partisans for one side or the other. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=289.24s)]
*  They're supposed to give real straightforward information, ask questions that will elicit [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=295.28s)]
*  the kind of decision-making that voters need. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  On abortion, it is pretty clear the left-wing media lives in a progressive enclave, and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  they don't understand how important the issue is, and their idea of fact-checking is to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  dismiss the evil of abortion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=324.4s)]
*  Black people would be the second-largest population in America, were it not for the system that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  the systematic destruction of black unborn babies in this country because of abortion. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  It happens, it happens. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=346.56s)]
*  Late-term, just ask Kermit Gosnell about killing, killing babies after they had been born. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=348.6s)]
*  If mothers hadn't died, we'd never know about it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=357.32s)]
*  Shame on the media for not living up to this awesome responsibility that our founders gave [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=361.16s)]
*  them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=367.2s)]
*  Well, we all heard Governor Northam, and we all know Tim Wall's radical stance. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=368.2s)]
*  No restrictions on abortion at all in Minnesota, even among seven, eight and nine. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=373.12s)]
*  You know, you can be a member of the media and have multiple roles. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=379.88s)]
*  You can be a talk show host. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=383.52s)]
*  The difference is you've got to be honest about it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=385.2s)]
*  We do news, investigative reporting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=387.68s)]
*  We give opinion. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  We're upfront about it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  We're honest about it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  We talk about culture. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=392.9s)]
*  We talk about sports. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, like a whole newspaper, but they claim to be journalists. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=395.64s)]
*  At ABC Disney, it doesn't exist. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=398.68s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAE2MYHFhUc&t=401.28000000000003s)]
