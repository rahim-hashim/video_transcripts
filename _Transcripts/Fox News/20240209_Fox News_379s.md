# Nikki Haley speaks out after loss to 'None of These Candidates' in Nevada
**Fox News:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU)
*  All right, joining us now with reaction to the disaster special counsel report for Joe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden as Republican presidential candidate, Nikki Haley. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=4.68s)]
*  Governor, Ambassador, great to have you back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=7.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's get your reaction first to Robert Herr's report and the press conference, the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  very angry one that occurred right after. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You know, a few things that you look at this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=18.12s)]
*  I mean, I think the first thing is you look at the fact that, you know, we need to have—we [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=21.76s)]
*  got to take the politics out of all of our agencies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=27.36s)]
*  I mean, whether this is Clinton, whether this is Biden, whether this is Trump, they all [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  need to be handled fairly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=33.68s)]
*  And clearly, that's not the case. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=35.16s)]
*  We have to get rid of the double standard, and that continues to show itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=36.76s)]
*  The second thing is it is unbelievably disturbing that they are showing that they see Biden [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=40.48s)]
*  to not have a good memory, that they see him as diminished, that they see that it's a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  problem, and they point blank say that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=51.56s)]
*  I mean, this is actually dangerous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=53.92s)]
*  I mean, I have said, look, people make fun of the fact that I say we need to have mental [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=56.16s)]
*  competency tests. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  There's a reason 70 percent of Americans don't want to see a Biden-Trump rematch. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  The party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=65.44s)]
*  But the third thing that bothers me about this is whether it's Biden or whether it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=70.28s)]
*  Trump, they both knew better. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=74.72s)]
*  You know when you work around national security documents, you know what's not supposed to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=77.4s)]
*  leave the office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=83.72s)]
*  You don't go bragging about these national security documents. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=85.04s)]
*  You don't go leave them in a garage. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=88.0s)]
*  Whatever it is, both these men knew better, and the arrogance that they both had to think [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=90.0s)]
*  they could walk out with these documents and just not think that there were going to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=94.64s)]
*  any repercussions, I think is the problem that we have with this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=98.44s)]
*  So I mean, look, it's a disturbing day for America right now, but I think we've got some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=102.2s)]
*  work to do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=105.84s)]
*  Isn't there a bigger problem, and that is that we don't have equal application of our [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=106.84s)]
*  laws? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=110.6s)]
*  Look at the Hillary Clinton case. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=111.6s)]
*  Yeah, top secret classified information, subpoenaed emails, 33,000 deleted, bleach pit, hammers, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=112.96s)]
*  devices, SIM cards. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=120.32s)]
*  You know, it seems to be a problem that they all have, because I don't think any of them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=122.92s)]
*  end up packing their own boxes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=126.28s)]
*  And the fact that one's criminalized, one of the three gets raided, and the other two [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=128.52s)]
*  happen to be Democrats, that reeks to me of political bias at the Justice Department. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=132.56s)]
*  No, I mean, I think, Sean, you have to know they— [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=136.8s)]
*  Have to know what? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they both knew what they had. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump was bragging about his. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=143.24s)]
*  Biden has got his in his garage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=144.24s)]
*  They knew what they had. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=145.96s)]
*  But the point is, whether it's Clinton, whether it's Biden, whether it's Trump, treat them [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=146.96s)]
*  the same. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  And the problem is, we have politics in every single agency in D.C., and we have got to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  clear it up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=156.72s)]
*  You can't serve the people if you're going to play partisan politics. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=157.72s)]
*  And we have seen this for years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  But President Trump had one thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  You're missing the point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  You have to clean these systems. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  President, Alina Haba just mentioned this, the Presidential Records Act. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  That impacted him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=171.24s)]
*  That did not impact Joe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=172.96s)]
*  That did not impact Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=173.96s)]
*  Let me move on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=174.96s)]
*  Let's talk about your campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=175.96s)]
*  I know you hate the question, but I've got to ask, because it's very real. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=176.96s)]
*  You go into Iowa, you came in third place. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=183.28s)]
*  You go into New Hampshire, you're lost by double digits. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  In Nevada, none of the above, basically, or not one of these candidates, at least in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=189.44s)]
*  primary, and you didn't take—you're not going to take part in the caucus tonight, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  which I don't know why you didn't do that, is there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  And then we have the real clear politics average. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=203.24s)]
*  And I'll put it up on the screen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  And in your home state of South Carolina, Donald Trump is leading 60 to 29.3 percent. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  So my question is, if you go to New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada happens, you lose your home state, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  even if you lost it by just double digits, not by 30 points, the question then becomes, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  what is your path to get the delegates to get the nomination? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=227.76s)]
*  Because at that point, I mean, don't you think you would have to win your home state? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=232.64s)]
*  I appreciate you asking that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=238.2s)]
*  You know, I'll tell you, it's interesting, because in Iowa, they were all saying, you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=239.72s)]
*  know, she's never going to make it through Iowa. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  We started at 2 percent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  We ended with 20 percent. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=246.76s)]
*  That was no small feat when we got rid of a dozen of the candidates. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=248.92s)]
*  Then you go into New Hampshire. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=252.0s)]
*  We got 43 percent of the vote. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=253.56s)]
*  But what's more important, Sean, is you have to acknowledge the Republican incumbent did [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=255.56s)]
*  not get 43 percent of the vote. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=259.8s)]
*  That's alarm bells. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=262.52s)]
*  Then you go into Nevada. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=263.52s)]
*  I mean, look, we were told months ago that this was a sham. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=264.52s)]
*  The GOP chair, he's under indictment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=268.68s)]
*  He worked with Trump. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=270.72s)]
*  They created these caucuses. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=271.92s)]
*  It's written about in news reports. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=273.88s)]
*  You can write, look it up on the Internet. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=275.56s)]
*  They planned this thing in the caucus. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=278.28s)]
*  They said that we had to pay 55,000 if we wanted to be in the caucus with Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=280.2s)]
*  And so, you know, Nevada didn't mean anything. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=284.88s)]
*  South Carolina, we're going to work it hard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=286.84s)]
*  We're going to bring it in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=288.68s)]
*  But I'm telling you, we better pay attention. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=289.68s)]
*  Look at what we lost. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=292.08s)]
*  You've got Trump paying 50 million dollars in legal fees from his campaign donations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=293.12s)]
*  You've got an RNC that's broke. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=297.64s)]
*  How do you beat Biden with that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=299.76s)]
*  You can't. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=301.48s)]
*  We have got to have a new generational leader. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=302.48s)]
*  You've been bringing that message. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=304.2s)]
*  If we're going to move forward. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=305.2s)]
*  This is not personal about Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=306.2s)]
*  But don't you at some point, Ambassador, Governor, don't you at some point have to win something? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=308.56s)]
*  I mean, you can talk about Iowa. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  You can talk about New Hampshire. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=315.72s)]
*  You can check off, you know, Nevada. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  South Carolina is a little hard to shake off when you were the governor there for two terms. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  And you'll see us move. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=326.44s)]
*  We moved 25 points in New Hampshire in those last three weeks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=327.44s)]
*  We're going to move in South Carolina. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  We don't do coronation, Sean. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=332.6s)]
*  You've got three states that have have it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=334.6s)]
*  I'm not coronating anybody. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=335.6s)]
*  Super Tuesdays. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=336.6s)]
*  Are you denying these polls? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=337.6s)]
*  You deny the polls anywhere? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QyTqDHMzVU&t=339.68s)]
