# Today was an ‘unmitigated disaster’ for Fani Willis: Hannity
**Fox News:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90)
*  Welcome to Hannity and today was an unmitigated disaster for Fulton County DA Fonny Willis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=0.0s)]
*  Now in case you weren't able to watch the hours-long hearing, what a disaster. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=7.36s)]
*  Well we have all the highlights you need to see, but first let's set up how we got here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Now Fonny and the special prosecutor on the Trump case in Georgia, Nathan Wade, her boyfriend, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=17.92s)]
*  they're accused of having an improper relationship and benefiting from Fulton County taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Now Fonny Willis allegedly hired her former boyfriend Wade, paid him over $650,000 in the case, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=29.68s)]
*  and then they used the money to go on a series of luxurious vacations together, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=38.32s)]
*  cruises in the Bahamas, along with trips to Aruba, Belize, Napa Valley, and that's not all. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=44.0s)]
*  Wade lacked the qualifications for the job of special prosecutor in the first place. Listen to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=50.8s)]
*  In fact, according to a court filing, there is no evidence that Nathan Wade has ever ever [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=56.72s)]
*  handled a felony case. So how did Wade end up being appointed to lead one of the most high [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=63.44s)]
*  profile cases in U.S. history? And by the way, a Rico case, which was ridiculous from the beginning [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=70.0s)]
*  to boot, it is an exorbitant salary on top of everything else. Now that is one of the big [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=75.52s)]
*  questions at the center of today's hearing. Now Willis appointed Wade to lead this case in November [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=83.2s)]
*  of 2021 and in a sworn statement, he previously claimed their romantic relationship began in 2022. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=88.72s)]
*  Little problem. According to one of Fonny Willis's former friends and co-workers, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=96.56s)]
*  the relationship actually started years before that. As a matter of fact, one of her close friends [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=101.12s)]
*  said, or former close friends, as she said later, used to be a friend, in 2019. Who's telling the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=106.32s)]
*  truth? You decide. There is no doubt in your mind that from 2019 until 2022, Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=114.0s)]
*  were in a romantic relationship. What's the question? You have no doubt that their romantic [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=122.88s)]
*  relationship was in effect from 2019 until the last time you spoke with her. No doubt. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=130.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. Now both Wade and Willis later denied their relationship began in 2019, but if true, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  that alone would throw the entire case into question on top of a lot of other issues because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=142.64s)]
*  that would mean she lied to the court. Now things only got worse when Nathan Wade took the stand [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  when asked if he had visited any cabins with Willis, a cabin, you know, to go on vacation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=154.24s)]
*  He paused for over 20 seconds before answering. Watch this. I'm asking if you remember paying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=160.32s)]
*  for a cabin six months ago in Tennessee. No. You remember booking a cabin? I booked lots of cabins. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Did you go to a cabin with Ms. Willis ever? Ever. Ever. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=180.0s)]
*  No. You've never gone to a cabin with Ms. Willis? No. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=190.32s)]
*  Wow. And when confronted about the trips that he booked for the two of them, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Wade said that Fonny Willis always repaid him in cash, which is intracable. Well, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  that's pretty convenient, isn't it? Take a look. You used your business credit card for these trips, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=221.44s)]
*  correct? I used my business credit card for everything. Okay. I, yes. You used it for your [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=227.12s)]
*  kids' tuition? Yes, ma'am. Used it for personal travel with Ms. Willis? Yes, ma'am. You said in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=232.4s)]
*  the affidavit that you roughly shared travel though, correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So this roughly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=238.4s)]
*  sharing travel, you're saying she reimbursed you? She did. And where did you deposit the money she [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=243.76s)]
*  reimbursed you? It was cash. She didn't, she didn't give me any checks. Now throughout his entire [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=249.2s)]
*  testimony, Nathan Wade seemed very uncomfortable. He was often seen wiping sweat off his face while [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=255.04s)]
*  taking questions, and Fonny Willis took the stand after Nathan Wade and was pressed on these [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=261.68s)]
*  payments. Here's what she had to say. Take a look. Where did that cash originally come from? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=267.92s)]
*  If it didn't come out of the bank? Cash is fungible. We've had cash for years in my house. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=272.48s)]
*  So for me to tell you the source of when it comes from, when you go to Publix and you buy something, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  you get $50, you throw it in there. It's been my whole life. When I took out a large amount of money [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  on my first campaign, I kept some of the cash of that. Like to tell you, I just have cash in my [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  house. I don't have as much today as I would normally have. Now Willis faced a number of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=295.36s)]
*  questions about the timeline of her relationship with Wade and in one very tense exchange, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=301.76s)]
*  and there were many of those, accused him of making this incredibly sexist comment. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=306.48s)]
*  Wait until you see this. Take a look. The romantic relationship ended before the indictment was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=311.12s)]
*  returned. Yes or no? To a man, yes. To a man, yes. To you, no? She's explained this, Mr. Sadow. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=316.56s)]
*  She's explained this. And did the forthcoming indictment have anything to do with that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=325.76s)]
*  Or was it just a coincidence? Mr. Let's go on and have the conversation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=332.24s)]
*  I'm just asking you whether or not it was a coincidence. It had absolutely nothing to do [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=338.96s)]
*  with this. It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  as he told me one time, the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=350.0s)]
*  What does that mean to a man, yes? Now what we have shown you so far, it's only the tip of the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=354.64s)]
*  iceberg from today's bombshell hearing. Let's take a look at some of the other highlights. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=360.24s)]
*  I probably had some choice words about some of the things that you said that were dishonest [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=365.2s)]
*  within this motion. So I don't know that it was a conversation. As you know, Mr. Wade is a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=369.6s)]
*  southern gentleman. Me, not so much. And I very much want to be here, so I'm not a hostile witness. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  I very much want to be here. Not so much that your hostility will be an adverse witness. Your [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=380.16s)]
*  interests are opposed to Ms. Merchant's. Thank you. Ms. Merchant's interests are contrary to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=384.8s)]
*  democracy, Your Honor, not to mine. He tells me how much it is and I give him the money back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't, just like you're asking me about the money with Robin, I don't do my friends like that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=396.56s)]
*  So if you tell me it's a G, then you're going to get $1,000. I think we did two different wine [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  tours that you do, which are pretty expensive. I think I bought him. He likes wine. I don't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=407.6s)]
*  really like wine, to be honest with you. I like Grey Goose. That was the most expensive thing that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=413.68s)]
*  I think that we did while we were there. So they would pair champagne, chocolate, and caviar. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  It was a three and it was like three different things. Sweden, Russia, someplace else. I'll make [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  that up. So let's be clear because you lied in this. Let me tell you which one you lied in. Right [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=433.36s)]
*  here. I think you lied right here. No, no, no, no. This is the truth, Judge. It is a lie. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=437.36s)]
*  I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=444.88s)]
*  Things got so out of control that at one point the judge actually warned Willis. The judge in this [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  case, by the way, I thought was very patient over her conduct on the stand. Watch for yourself. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=457.44s)]
*  2020. Did Mr. Wade ever visit you at a place that you resided? He has never been to my home [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=463.04s)]
*  in South Fulton. 2020 was before I knew that a phone call was going to be made and I was going [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=469.44s)]
*  to have to abandon my home. As a result thereof, he never visited, lived at, came to, or has seen [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=474.56s)]
*  South Fulton. You qualified that with your home in South Fulton. That's where I lived in 2020. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=482.64s)]
*  Did he ever visit you at a place that you resided? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, I don't understand. You want to give me guys. In 2020, I lived in South Fulton. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=493.28s)]
*  Okay. That's the only place I lived in South Fulton. That's before I had to abandon my home, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  Judge. All right. And at my home in South Fulton. We're going to clarify this. We'll break it down. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=501.76s)]
*  He never came there, okay? So if you don't come someplace, you can't live there. Ms. Willis, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=506.24s)]
*  I'm going to have to caution you. This is going to be my first time I have to caution you. We have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=510.48s)]
*  to listen to the questions as asked. And if this happens again and again, I'm going to have no [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=515.12s)]
*  choice but to strike your testimony. Wow. Even the media mob, they were forced to admit that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=520.72s)]
*  today was a complete disaster for Willis and her case against Donald Trump. Take a look. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=526.16s)]
*  Don't let the legalese fool you. This is epic. This is monumental. If things are going in the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=531.84s)]
*  direction we think Fonny Willis lied to the court, it's game over for her. She will be disqualified. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=537.12s)]
*  It's a mess for the office, to be clear. Regardless of what the legality is, it is a mess for the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=544.64s)]
*  office and something they're going to have to deal with. They're going to have to put in front of a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=549.84s)]
*  jury that is seeing all this playing out. It might be appropriate for Ms. Willis to consider [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=552.0s)]
*  removing herself from this case now and turning the reins over to a senior official in the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=557.92s)]
*  district attorney's office and let him or her handle it because this is getting ugly and it's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=564.24s)]
*  getting messy and my guess is it's not going to get better. Now we kind of saved the best part [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=569.28s)]
*  for last. This is Fonny Willis as a candidate talking about this very issue and how Fulton [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=575.52s)]
*  County, Georgia residents deserves a DA that won't be hooking up with their employees. Take a look. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=582.88s)]
*  Because you're sitting with someone today that actually wants to make a difference, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=590.72s)]
*  because they deserve a DA that won't have sex with his employees, because they deserve a DA [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=594.96s)]
*  that won't put money in their own pocket. I certainly will not be choosing people to date [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=601.84s)]
*  that work under me. Let me just say that. Now earlier tonight, former president Trump, he did [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=606.64s)]
*  weigh in on the drama from today telling Fox News that Fonny Willis, well quote, badly tainted, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=613.2s)]
*  is badly tainted and her case against him is a scam. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIsK53SX90&t=620.24s)]
