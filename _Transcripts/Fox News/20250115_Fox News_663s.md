# Sean Hannity: We heard typical mumbling from Biden in his farewell
**Fox News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight we are T-minus five days until Donald J. Trump is sworn into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=0.0s)]
*  office. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=8.28s)]
*  But tonight, things, big things, are already underway. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=9.6s)]
*  Here at home, Donald Trump's cabinet nominees, they are demonstrating a very high level of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=13.76s)]
*  confidence and integrity at their Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=17.88s)]
*  Also coming up tonight, we will show you how Donald Trump's pick for AG, Pam Bondi, literally [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=21.6s)]
*  flipped the script on the congenital liar Adam Schiff. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  It was a moment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=31.4s)]
*  If you missed it, you missed a lot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=32.2s)]
*  Also tonight, a major accomplishment for the president-elect overseas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=34.08s)]
*  This is really big news and good news. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=38.32s)]
*  We're going to bring you the details of the Middle East peace deal that was reached with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=41.08s)]
*  Donald Trump getting it across the finish line. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  By strength, by fear that he instilled in foreign adversaries, and they know he means [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=51.0s)]
*  what he says. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=57.32s)]
*  But first, I don't know any other way to put it, just a pathetic farewell address from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=58.0s)]
*  a frankly pathetic career politician filled with delusion of success and petty political [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=65.12s)]
*  attacks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=71.88s)]
*  What you just heard tonight, the typical mumbling, bumbling and stumbling, as usual, every clich√© [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=72.88s)]
*  imaginable, false hope for the next president to do so well after really doing nothing but [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=79.0s)]
*  sabotage Donald Trump before he gets into office, a corrupt family, a weaponized DOJ [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  that has caused massive harm to our justice system. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=91.92s)]
*  In the end, a sad, pathetic, angry man that you decide, what did he accomplish? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=95.68s)]
*  Ask yourself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=103.12s)]
*  He failed to mention that we are now on, by the way, preemptive pardon watch, as the president [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  now reportedly considering get out of jail free cards for his brother, for Anthony Fauci, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=108.8s)]
*  for Liz Cheney, for Benny Thompson, and a whole list of others, maybe even himself. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=114.2s)]
*  He also failed to mention his greatest legacy, and that is the millions upon millions and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=120.2s)]
*  millions of unvetted, illegal immigrants that poured into this country, including violent [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=125.52s)]
*  criminals, murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members and known terrorists. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=132.24s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=138.76s)]
*  We know that they are here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=139.76s)]
*  This is what Joe is leaving behind for Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, mark my words, the greatest legacy of Joe Biden will be these unvetted, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  illegal immigrants, the crimes they commit and the possible terror attacks on our homeland. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  Instead, in tonight's, quote, farewell address, we got more class warfare against a handful [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=157.48s)]
*  of billionaires, oligarchs, as he's calling them, who don't support him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=163.04s)]
*  His family had no problem taking a lot of money from a Russian oligarch, the former [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=167.92s)]
*  first lady of Moscow, or dealing with wealthy companies in Ukraine and China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=171.88s)]
*  He didn't mention that part either. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=176.44s)]
*  And of course, then he gave a dire warning about the left's favorite boogeyman climate [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=179.28s)]
*  change, the biggest existential threat to our country, and a call for more censorship [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=183.32s)]
*  online after it was Joe Biden himself who coerced big tech into censoring the facts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=188.48s)]
*  about COVID-19, along with the truth about the very real laptop of his son Hunter. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=195.16s)]
*  And that real story, that was Wink and Tony Blinken that tried to cover it up, organizing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  a letter with 51 former intelligence officials, supposedly debunking the story as Russian [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=207.52s)]
*  disinformation to give him a talking point before a debate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=213.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, not one of those people ever one time saw that laptop or knew a thing about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=216.6s)]
*  the laptop. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=220.96s)]
*  This was a typical Biden speech. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=222.28s)]
*  It was disorganized. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=224.12s)]
*  It was mumbling. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=225.76s)]
*  It was uninspiring, riddled with visions of grandeur about himself, along with doom and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=226.76s)]
*  gloom about political rivals. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=231.88s)]
*  You decide. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=233.96s)]
*  My farewell address tonight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=234.96s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=237.72s)]
*  This is a dangerous concentration, and that's the dangerous concentration of power in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=243.12s)]
*  hands of a very few ultra wealthy people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=247.16s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=250.44s)]
*  Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=256.16s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=262.44s)]
*  Right now, the existential threat of climate change has never been clear. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=265.12s)]
*  Just look across the country from California to North Carolina. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=271.4s)]
*  That's why I signed the most significant climate and clean energy law ever. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=276.44s)]
*  The powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=280.52s)]
*  to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=286.28s)]
*  Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=292.36s)]
*  the abuse of power. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=298.56s)]
*  The free press is crumbling. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=300.32s)]
*  Editors are disappearing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=302.64s)]
*  Real media is giving up on fact checking. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=304.98s)]
*  The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  We need to amend the constitution to make clear that no president, no president is immune [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=313.3s)]
*  from crimes that he or she commits while in office. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  It was his administration, his DOJ, that was pressuring Big Tech to tell a lot of those [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  lies. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  You can't make that part up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  Now ultimately, Biden's five decades in the Washington swamp were never about service. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=330.74s)]
*  We're making this a better place, always about himself and his own personal gain. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=335.62s)]
*  The results, they speak for himself. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  So tonight, look, forget about what I think. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=343.06s)]
*  Ask yourself, every American needs to ask themselves tonight, are you better off than [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=346.34s)]
*  you were four years ago? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  Can you identify one policy that he implemented that improved your life? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=354.34s)]
*  Economically, everything you buy in every store you go to costs more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=360.06s)]
*  Interest rates are higher. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=365.38s)]
*  You're paying about a buck fifty more a gallon for gasoline. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=366.38s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=369.62s)]
*  Are you more safe and more secure, both here at home and abroad? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=371.06s)]
*  After nearly 50 years of working for government, Biden, he owns multi-million dollar mansions. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=375.46s)]
*  He goes on lavish vacations. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=381.68s)]
*  He's worth reportedly millions of dollars with most of his career. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=383.94s)]
*  He made $200,000 or less, and people will always call him Mr. President. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=388.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=393.2s)]
*  At the same time, Americans, most Americans I know, and the polls show this and confirm [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=394.2s)]
*  this, are far worse off, especially the middle class that he claims to have a monopoly of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  compassion on. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=404.0s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't seem to care less for him. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=405.32s)]
*  It's his mission accomplished moment. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=407.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, the incoming administration is already, they're hitting the ground running. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=410.08s)]
*  This is an amazing phenomenon we are witnessing before our eyes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=414.36s)]
*  Real successes for you, the American people. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=418.68s)]
*  This is real safety and security abroad. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=421.68s)]
*  Breaking today, a ceasefire deal in Gaza. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  That means freedom for 33 hostages, hopefully more, a plan for a lasting peace, just one [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  week after Donald J. Trump delivered this warning. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=438.26s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation, if they're [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=444.58s)]
*  And it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=450.38s)]
*  All hell will break out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=454.78s)]
*  I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=455.78s)]
*  And they should have given them back a long time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=458.3s)]
*  They should have never taken them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=459.74s)]
*  They should have never been the attack of October 7th. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=461.58s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=464.3s)]
*  Today would not have happened were it not for that moment. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=467.14s)]
*  Donald Trump, he didn't just warn the terrorists of Hamas and their friends in the Middle [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=470.09999999999997s)]

*  He took action. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  The president-elect, he sent a delegation‚Äîyou saw Steve Witkoff in that video‚Äîto the region [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  to negotiate a deal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=481.53999999999996s)]
*  A deal has been struck. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=482.94s)]
*  According to Arab leaders, Donald Trump made more progress in one meeting than Joe Biden [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=484.38s)]
*  did all year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=489.5s)]
*  Top Qatari officials now said Trump and his envoy pushed this deal over the finish line [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  and they thanked Trump for his leadership. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=497.14000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=499.62s)]
*  You, as you say, have been working on this deal for many months. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=500.62s)]
*  And the question is, why now? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=504.82000000000005s)]
*  Why this moment? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=507.18s)]
*  And was it pressure from the incoming Trump administration that got it over the line? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=508.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=513.22s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Yelda, for this question. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=514.22s)]
*  Actually, we've been raising the question of the right moment for the entire period [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=517.7s)]
*  since the collapse of the first phase. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=522.6600000000001s)]
*  But we have seen a momentum that started to build in the last month and we kept pushing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=527.02s)]
*  for that, working together very closely with our partners. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=531.54s)]
*  And I can say that what we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=535.66s)]
*  transcending both administration, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=544.5s)]
*  to reach to that deal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=550.82s)]
*  And I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=552.78s)]
*  Instead of being happy, back at the White House, Joe Biden was seething. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=558.22s)]
*  One day, of course, after forgetting how to sign his name on a bill during a bill-signing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=562.86s)]
*  ceremony, the frankly petty and competent current president tried to take full credit [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=567.1s)]
*  for the plea deal. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=572.06s)]
*  He announced about two hours after Donald Trump. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=574.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=577.8199999999999s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=581.82s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=584.86s)]
*  No, that would be Donald Trump made this happen, not him. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  That's the joke. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=593.2600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, Joe Biden, maybe he should circle back to his own State Department. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=594.2600000000001s)]
*  They thanked Donald Trump earlier today in case he missed it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=598.7800000000001s)]
*  When it comes to the involvement of President-elect Trump's team, it has been absolutely critical [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=601.98s)]
*  in getting this deal over the line. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=606.5400000000001s)]
*  I would just say, lastly, I don't know if it's unprecedented to have envoys from [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=608.1s)]
*  an outgoing and an incoming administration sitting at the same table negotiating a ceasefire [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=614.5s)]
*  agreement of this kind. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=619.74s)]
*  But if it's not unprecedented, it's certainly unusual. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=620.74s)]
*  And we, of course, thank the Trump team for working with this on this ceasefire agreement. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=623.78s)]
*  We think it's important that they were at the table. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=629.26s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, because it was Donald Trump that sent his envoy on his own [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  dime to the Middle East to relay the message that all hell would break loose if, in fact, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=638.14s)]
*  they didn't get this deal done. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=643.62s)]
*  And as we look back on the four years of Joe Biden's presidency, do you think he was qualified [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=646.1s)]
*  for this job? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=652.3s)]
*  Were we right when we warned before the 2020 election that he was not cognitively strong [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=653.3s)]
*  enough for the job? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=658.86s)]
*  Again, that's a decision you, the American people, have to make. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUwC8GQ6bI&t=659.86s)]
