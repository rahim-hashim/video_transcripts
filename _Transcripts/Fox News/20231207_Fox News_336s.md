# Jonathan Turley: The circle around Joe Biden is getting tighter
**Fox News:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM)
*  All right, this is a Fox News alert breaking tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=0.0s)]
*  If you are just joining us, federal prosecutors have just filed nine new charges against Hunter [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  Biden, all related to a tax evasion scheme. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=9.28s)]
*  But the pressing question of the night is, well, what does this mean for the president? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  What did he know? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=18.12s)]
*  When did he know it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=19.12s)]
*  And, by the way, when are FARA charges ever going to be filed? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=20.12s)]
*  Will they be filed? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=23.88s)]
*  Here with analysis, law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=25.0s)]
*  Jonathan, you have been one of the few honest Democrats that have been pointing out this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=28.64s)]
*  is a very real scandal with real implications for Joe Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=33.88s)]
*  And even though people in the media wanted to go away, people in the Democratic Party [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=39.38s)]
*  wanted to go away, you've been warning them it's not going away. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=43.36s)]
*  And I think all roads now lead back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And Joe Biden has a lot to answer for, starting with why he lied repeatedly to the country, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=52.2s)]
*  including yesterday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=57.16s)]
*  Well, I think that's true. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=60.16s)]
*  You know, the fact is that this is a circle that's getting tighter around the president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  I mean, it's clear that the president has lied. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=67.64s)]
*  He obviously lied during the first campaign when he said he had no knowledge of these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  dealings. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=76.12s)]
*  Hunter himself contradicted that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=77.0s)]
*  Hunter's associates said that it was utter nonsense in recent statements after his testimony. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=79.56s)]
*  He also said that his son didn't make any money in China. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=86.52s)]
*  That obviously is not true. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=89.44s)]
*  But there's a more serious problem here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=91.8s)]
*  And that is what the president knew of was not business dealings. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  It was corruption. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=100.16s)]
*  That's what influence peddling is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=101.62s)]
*  The United States has pushed international agreements to stop influence peddling in other [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=103.44s)]
*  countries. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=108.44s)]
*  The United States believes it is a leading source of destructive corruption. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=109.44s)]
*  If the president knew that his family was engaging in that type of corruption, of course [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=114.8s)]
*  it's serious. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=120.4s)]
*  So we're looking at two events next week. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=121.78s)]
*  One is when Hunter Biden is supposed to appear, that may now be effectively scuttled. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=125.72s)]
*  Hunter may be able to use this to plead the fifth to refuse to answer questions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=132.24s)]
*  But the second event is the expected vote on the impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=138.34s)]
*  This indictment might make it easier for Hunter not to speak, but it may make it more difficult [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=144.24s)]
*  for President Biden to avoid that inquiry. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=151.0s)]
*  The fact is that this indictment shatters years of denials by the Bidens and frankly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=155.52s)]
*  by enabling media. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=162.8s)]
*  It shows these massive amounts of money going to Hunter Biden from Romania, Ukraine, China, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=165.2s)]
*  all these sources. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=172.92s)]
*  And it also shows a knowing and continual effort to evade taxes, to commit criminal [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=174.88s)]
*  acts. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, if this circle is getting closer to the president, then he has to answer some questions. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  So it leads us to this very simple question for next week. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  Is any Democrat going to stand up and have this moment of courage and to say, you know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=192.72s)]
*  what, enough? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=199.48s)]
*  You know, we can't say we're against corruption and influence peddling and then say we don't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=201.88s)]
*  even want to do an inquiry as to whether there's an inquiry. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=206.32s)]
*  So when you look at the lies, we start there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=211.32s)]
*  Then you look at the sheer number of suspicious activity reports. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=213.68s)]
*  Then you look at the identified shell corporations with no real business purposes except to move [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  money around. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=223.28s)]
*  Then the sheer amount of money, tens of millions of dollars, with no evidence of any services [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=224.7s)]
*  rendered of any kind. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=230.88s)]
*  And then the big question is, like, for example, in the case of Barisma, did Joe Biden as vice [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=233.66s)]
*  president take official action that financially benefited his family? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=240.0s)]
*  Because 18 USC, I believe it is 201, that's the bribery statute, Jonathan Terley. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=245.44s)]
*  Bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=252.44s)]
*  I think you know where those words come from. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=257.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=258.52s)]
*  And when I testified in the first Biden impeachment, one of the things I emphasized was this speculation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=259.52s)]
*  of whether the president benefited from this money is absolutely absurd. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=265.24s)]
*  In federal cases, it's well established that if people give money to your family, it can [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=271.0s)]
*  be bribery. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=277.48s)]
*  And many of the Democrats are just simply ignoring that fact. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  There's also a collision problem here with Hunter Biden. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=283.84s)]
*  In the gun charges, his counsel has said, you know what? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=287.08s)]
*  He came out of an addiction around the time that he signed that form. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=291.76s)]
*  And so he was signing it truthfully because he had clarity. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, the problem is a lot of these crimes occurred during that period. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=301.32s)]
*  So did he have clarity with the tax evasions that were being committed during the same [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  period? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  A lot of questions to be answered. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre's job just got a lot harder tonight. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll see what she tries to say tomorrow to spin out of this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think we'll be hearing from Joe much in the near future. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=319.6s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, thank you, sir. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srfgiw6LBzM&t=322.88s)]
