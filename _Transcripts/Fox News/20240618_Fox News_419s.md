# Lindsey Graham: Things are about to get worse
**Fox News:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU)
*  Newsom's video was met with widespread backlash tonight, and after eight illegals with suspected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=0.0s)]
*  ties to ISIS were arrested in a multi-city operation sting last week, Senator Lindsey [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=6.36s)]
*  Graham, Senator Rand Paul, they are pressing the DHS secretary, Mayorkas, for answers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=11.8s)]
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Hartford County Sheriff [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=18.04s)]
*  Jeffrey Gaylor. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  Jeffrey, I did notice that your governor is blaming the broken immigration policy on Donald [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=24.06s)]
*  Trump for the death of this mother of five and the rape and death of this mother of five. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=31.779999999999998s)]
*  This guy came here in 2023, and I'd like to know, how do you get to that point when the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=38.5s)]
*  border was never more secure than when Donald Trump was president? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=43.78s)]
*  Sean, you are a thousand percent right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=48.42s)]
*  I mean, I've been in office now 10 years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=50.74s)]
*  I've gone through from President Obama to President Trump, and the border was never [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=54.1s)]
*  more secure than it was under President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=57.9s)]
*  You know, the flow of drugs and the flow of criminals across the southern border in particular. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=61.42s)]
*  My chief deputy and I were down there last year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=66.62s)]
*  The same day the vice president was saying the border was secure, we were looking at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  open gates and what, unconstructed wall, no lighting, no security at all. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=71.42s)]
*  And of course, they're not getting the resources. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=77.46s)]
*  And we have a president who invited so many people to invade, to come to this country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=79.06s)]
*  And a lot of those are looking for a better life, and I get that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=85.82s)]
*  But mixed amongst them are the terrorists and the persons, sadly, the murder of Rachel [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Moore here in our county. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=95.5s)]
*  And one, we had another incident last year with an illegal immigrant who killed a young [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=97.06s)]
*  lady in this county, much in the same way Rachel was killed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=101.74s)]
*  Just unacceptable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=105.34s)]
*  And Senator, look, I'm sorry, but it's Joe Biden that has blood on his hands here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden does. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=112.3s)]
*  These are his policies. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  You know, and he's been lying to the country for three years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  Now they decided to switch gears, blame Republicans, which is not true, because his idiotic idea [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=117.58s)]
*  would have allowed 5,000 illegals in before they even enforced the border laws. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=123.62s)]
*  But the question is, when you look at 30,000 Chinese nationals in this fiscal year alone, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=128.7s)]
*  which is not over, and 26,000 last year, and tens of thousands from Russia, Iran, Syria, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=135.17999999999998s)]
*  Yemen, Egypt, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and you tell me, are they coming here because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=142.94s)]
*  they want a better life? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  Are the Chinese nationals buying up thousands of acres of farm ranch land and land near [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  military installation? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=155.06s)]
*  Are they looking for a better life for themselves and their family, Senator? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=156.06s)]
*  Or is it the worst national security threat in our lifetime? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's the worst national security threat in our lifetime. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=164.94s)]
*  But let's don't just pass over what happened to Rachel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=167.98s)]
*  The sheriff is a great man, and I appreciate his determination to get this case solved. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  But the man who's accused of killing her was captured three times and released by the Biden [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=177.42s)]
*  administration before he came back the fourth time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=182.42s)]
*  The man who murdered Lakin Riley, accused of killing her, was released on parole, not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=186.06s)]
*  because of a factor in the law, no space to hold him in El Paso, Texas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  So there's two young women murdered by people that were in our custody that were let go [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=198.78s)]
*  by the Biden administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  They do have blood on their hands. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=206.1s)]
*  And it's about to get worse. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=207.94s)]
*  If they do this executive order tomorrow, allowing a million people here illegally to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=209.18s)]
*  be paroled in place, it's like pouring gasoline on a fire. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  What about reports that we read over the weekend that, in fact, you know, they're mailing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=220.86s)]
*  out ballots and some of these ballots are ending up in the homes of illegal immigrants? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, do we have to worry about that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=228.5s)]
*  Yeah, you got to worry about a lot. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=230.9s)]
*  You got to worry about a bunch of people trying to kill us. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=232.62s)]
*  These eight people from Tajikistan were captured, released, then vetted. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  So here's what they're doing under the Biden administration. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=241.02s)]
*  They catch, they release, then they poorly vet. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  They let the people go, then they try to figure out who they are. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  We're dodging bullets every day when it comes to terrorism. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=250.46s)]
*  Young women like the two that I just mentioned are dying. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=253.42s)]
*  The largest number of deaths for young people in this country are fentanyl poisoning coming [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=256.42s)]
*  across our southern border from China. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=260.94s)]
*  They literally have blood on their hands. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=263.34s)]
*  The only criminal running for office, in my view, is not Donald Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=265.7s)]
*  It is Joe Biden. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=269.34s)]
*  What he's doing to this country at the border is a crime. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=270.56s)]
*  People are dying based on his policies. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=273.9s)]
*  Nobody got hurt. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Nobody lost a penny based on what happened in New York. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=277.38s)]
*  But Americans are dying by the tens of thousands because of the policies of Joe Biden, the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=280.32s)]
*  victim of Joe Biden's criminal activity, or is it the American people? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=285.98s)]
*  You know, I'll give you the last word, if you don't mind, Sheriff. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=290.02s)]
*  I am telling you, I'm not, I don't have the law enforcement experience that you have. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=295.9s)]
*  You don't need to be a genius to realize that when you have all of these people coming [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=300.64s)]
*  from our top geopolitical foes with ties to radical Islamic terrorism, that there are [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=305.06s)]
*  terror cells in this country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=311.3s)]
*  And 9-11 or worse is coming. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=313.46s)]
*  Now, it's not a matter of if to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=315.82s)]
*  It's almost a guarantee. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=318.42s)]
*  I hope and pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=320.46s)]
*  I don't think I'm wrong. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=322.5s)]
*  I've been saying it over and over again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=323.78s)]
*  And I think the only answer, 53% of Hispanic Americans want illegal immigrants deported. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=326.12s)]
*  62% of Americans want illegal immigrants deported. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  They want the law enforced. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=338.14s)]
*  Can that happen? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=340.18s)]
*  Well, it's up to Congress, obviously, and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as I said in my [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=341.18s)]
*  news conference about Rachel Moore's killer. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=347.82s)]
*  Again, we have a small community just 30 minutes north of Baltimore to have two of these cases [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=350.78s)]
*  where someone, we're not unique. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=356.17999999999995s)]
*  You know, this is happening all over the country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=358.26s)]
*  You have two of these cases right here that just multiply that across our country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=359.86s)]
*  How many people are losing their lives? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=364.5s)]
*  And certainly, yes, I do believe that you can look at the fentanyl problem and the lives [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=366.5s)]
*  that that's costing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  But I do believe that we are at threat of something much bigger and terrorist related, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  because we just fail to do, you know, so many elected officials. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=375.54s)]
*  My oath of office is to protect the citizens here in Hartford County. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=379.26s)]
*  It's a public safety issue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=382.3s)]
*  And everyone in Congress and the president of the United States needs to abide by their [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=384.06s)]
*  oath of office and do the same thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=387.38s)]
*  We need to protect the American public. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=389.02s)]
*  Yeah, well said. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=390.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it, Sheriff. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for the good work you're doing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  Senator Graham, I'm not looking forward to the day I have you on and getting able to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  say, being able to say, I warned you, told you this was going to happen. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=399.9s)]
*  I pray to God that day never comes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=404.14s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=406.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnlEHuatpU&t=419.02s)]
