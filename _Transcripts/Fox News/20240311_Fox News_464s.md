# Sean Hannity: Biden forgot those killed under his watch
**Fox News:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w)
*  Two words. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=0.0s)]
*  Abbey Gate. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=2.0s)]
*  It was the site of that deadly terror attack during Biden's disastrous withdrawal from [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=3.5s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=8.08s)]
*  That's the one where 13 brave U.S. service members were murdered. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=9.08s)]
*  Last week, the gold star father of a U.S. Marine killed in that attack yelled, quote, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=13.36s)]
*  Abbey Gate, from the House gallery during Biden's—well, hyped up, stated the union [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=18.76s)]
*  address. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=24.48s)]
*  He was then dragged out and arrested by Capitol Police. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=25.48s)]
*  Tonight, he will join us with his first interview and respond. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=28.8s)]
*  That's straight ahead. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, no one has ever been held accountable for Biden's tumultuous withdrawal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=32.84s)]
*  from Afghanistan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Biden didn't even seem to understand what this gold star father was shouting. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=39.28s)]
*  The president has long forgotten those who were killed under his watch, those that he [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  left behind. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=48.42s)]
*  And a very hyper, jacked-up Joe Biden? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=49.42s)]
*  Well, he did cover a lot of topics during the State of the Union address. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=52.2s)]
*  Other topics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=56.72s)]
*  He was even shamed into mentioning Laken Reilly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=57.76s)]
*  She's the young woman who was reportedly murdered by one of the nearly 10-plus illegal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=61.16s)]
*  immigrants, unvetted illegal immigrants, of Joe Biden that have poured across the open [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=67.2s)]
*  border to our—in our south. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=73.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, well, even Joe got her name wrong, calling her Lincoln Reilly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=75.52s)]
*  On Facebook, well, Laken Reilly's mother—good for her—she responded, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=81.24s)]
*  Biden does not even know my child's name. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=85.72s)]
*  It is pathetic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  She's right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, Joe didn't publicly apologize to the Reilly family or even acknowledge his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  mistake. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=96.12s)]
*  No, instead, he went on MSDNC for a propaganda interview to express his deep and sincere [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=97.12s)]
*  regret that he accurately called the illegal immigrant charged with killing Laken Reilly, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  not Lincoln, Laken Joe, an illegal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=109.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=113.12s)]
*  You used the word illegal when talking about the man who allegedly killed Laken Reilly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=114.44s)]
*  An undocumented person. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=120.36s)]
*  And I shouldn't have used illegal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=122.36s)]
*  I shouldn't have—it's undocumented. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=123.36s)]
*  And look, when I spoke about the difference between Trump and me, one of the things I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=125.0s)]
*  talked about on the border was that his—the way he talks about vermin, the way he talks [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=129.0s)]
*  about these people polluting the blood. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=133.24s)]
*  I talked about what I'm not going to do, what I won't do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=135.4s)]
*  I'm not going to treat any—any—any of these people with disrespect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, they built the country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=141.92s)]
*  The reason our economy is growing, we have to control the border and more orderly flow, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=144.28s)]
*  but I don't share his view at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=148.8s)]
*  So you regret using that word. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=151.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Illegal immigrants, Joe, did not build the country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Legal immigrants did. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Where's the apology to Laken, not Lincoln? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Laken Reilly's family, Joe, a young woman, is dead. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=164.08s)]
*  And Joe Biden is focused more on using the more inclusive language to describe, to allege, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  the killer, while falsely claiming that illegal immigrants, quote, built the country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=173.84s)]
*  No, Joe, legal immigrants did that, like my grandparents, all four that came from Ireland. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=178.12s)]
*  As Biden does nothing to curb illegal immigration, he's been aiding and abetting and lying [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=183.52s)]
*  to us for three years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=188.24s)]
*  He's not even attempted to prevent violent offenders from crossing our border. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=189.76s)]
*  And meanwhile, President Trump, former President Trump, actually did meet with the family of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=194.84s)]
*  Laken Reilly. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=199.4s)]
*  He had this to say about this very bright young nursing student who was brutally, and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  she was brutally murdered. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=205.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=207.8s)]
*  One of the lives that was taken from us was an incredible 22-year-old nursing student [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=208.8s)]
*  right here in Georgia, Laken Reilly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=217.68s)]
*  From the time she was in the first grade, Laken's dream was to spend her life caring [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=221.08s)]
*  for others. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=227.6s)]
*  Her beautiful mother and family, backstage sister, friends, some of her friends, a roommate, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  they said she was like the best. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=235.16s)]
*  She was always the best. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  She was—they admit that she was the best. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And she was the first in her class. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=240.56s)]
*  She was going to be the best nurse. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=242.24s)]
*  She was the best nursing student. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=244.04s)]
*  She was always the best. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=246.28s)]
*  She was the brightest light in every room, they told me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=247.28s)]
*  I wonder if MSDNC hosts will giggle over it being the number one issue to the people in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=252.24s)]
*  states like Virginia. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=258.52s)]
*  Laken Reilly's death is totally unacceptable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=260.44s)]
*  In fact, every single murder or violent offense committed by an illegal immigrant is unacceptable. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=262.64s)]
*  That is simple, basic, fundamental, common sense. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  While the illegal immigration—while legal immigration is an important part of our country, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  that is true. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=278.64s)]
*  Individuals without background checks, any proper vetting, who abuse our asylum process [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=280.2s)]
*  and commit crimes, they should not be here, and they should be deported. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=285.12s)]
*  And yet thousands upon thousands pour across that border every single day, including drug [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=289.8s)]
*  traffickers, murderers, rapists, and yes, even terrorists. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=295.36s)]
*  Even today, FBI Director Wray testified yet again that individuals linked to ISIS are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  now taking advantage of Joe Biden's wide-open southern border. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=306.32s)]
*  He just forgot the Joe Biden part. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=310.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=312.4s)]
*  There is a particular network that has—where some of the overseas facilitators of the smuggling [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=313.4s)]
*  network have ISIS ties that we're very concerned about, and that we've been spending an enormous [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=320.64s)]
*  amount of effort with our partners investigating. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  Exactly what that network is up to is something that's, again, the subject of our current [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  investigation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=335.56s)]
*  But, sir, is a network we're concerned about that has facilitators involved in it that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=336.56s)]
*  have ties to ISIS and other terrorist organizations? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=341.24s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=344.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=345.2s)]
*  Our top geopolitical foes—I keep repeating it—Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Russia, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=346.2s)]
*  and China. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=353.08s)]
*  Joe Biden signed dozens of executive orders, as Mayorkas once said, too many to even list. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=354.08s)]
*  All of those executive orders, with the stroke of a pen, eliminated Donald Trump's critical [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=360.72s)]
*  border protections that were working, including several on his very first day in office. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  Even flew thousands—hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants just directly from their [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  home countries, from Latin American airports, saving them the trip to the border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=380.92s)]
*  You paid for all those private flights. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  And now terrorists have to be here among the millions of illegals who have entered our [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=384.22s)]
*  country. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=389.0s)]
*  Joe, are you even going to listen to your own FBI director? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=390.0s)]
*  Well, I don't particularly think he's the best at his job, and I think he's weaponized [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=393.6s)]
*  and politicized that great former—the greatest institution ever, the height of law enforcement [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=397.0s)]
*  in the world, the gold standard that has been corrupted by politics. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=403.96s)]
*  Now, according to Gallup, a large majority of the American people now see Joe Biden's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=408.04s)]
*  open border as a critical threat to our country. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=413.04s)]
*  And yet, President Biden refuses to reverse course. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=416.2s)]
*  He'd rather put Americans in extreme danger than admit that in fact Donald Trump was right [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  and that he made a mistake by rescinding those policies. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=425.72s)]
*  Now, this represents a massive betrayal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=428.8s)]
*  And with Joe in office, it will only get worse, a clear and present danger to this country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=432.32s)]
*  And time and time again, Biden has proved himself to be a terrible president, a congenital [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=437.18s)]
*  liar. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YBsuIOT6w&t=442.8s)]
