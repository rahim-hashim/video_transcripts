# Michael Cohen will only tell the truth if there is no alternative: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0)
*  And joining us now, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan, let's get your overall observations of the day. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=2.96s)]
*  Not exactly the most credible witness, to say the least. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=6.4s)]
*  No, not at all. And indeed, one of the most impressive things about the last two days is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=12.4s)]
*  it does appear that Cohen may have committed perjury again. You know, his explanations on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  various points do not strike some of us as true. You know, when he said that he [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=22.8s)]
*  surreptitiously taped the president, which just blasts away ethical obligations, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=28.72s)]
*  he said he was doing that really to help Trump and to keep David Pecker honest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=36.72s)]
*  It makes no sense. That is, it's just no one can get their head around that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=41.44s)]
*  But that was just one of a number of moments where you really have to be impressed with this guy, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=47.2s)]
*  who really has shown throughout his life that he'll only tell the truth if he has no alternative. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=53.04s)]
*  Now, what I think was the most amazing thing today is that the prosecutor said that they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  will close their case, they'll rest their case after Cohen's testimony is done. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  There's only one problem. Nobody has established the elements of any crime. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=72.16s)]
*  The government has not even stated or explained why listing these payments as legal expenses [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=77.12s)]
*  is not correct. They haven't put on any material evidence to support those elements. Most judges [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=84.56s)]
*  would be insulted for prosecutors to say, well, that's a wrap, without ever making the basis for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=92.0s)]
*  a case. So the judge is going to have this motion for a directed verdict. And I think any judge in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=98.4s)]
*  good faith would grant that motion. If he sends this to the jury, he is sending a case to a jury [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=104.4s)]
*  where no crime has been stated and even core factual issues remain very much in doubt. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=111.12s)]
*  I still cannot figure out not only what the crime was that brought to life this dead misdemeanor, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=117.76s)]
*  I can't figure out what the government's arguing as to how this should have been denoted. If it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=125.04s)]
*  wasn't a legal expense, what's the notation some accountant should have put in a ledger? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=129.76s)]
*  None of us know because they just have shrugged. And that's what this case is. It's a shrug. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=135.76s)]
*  And they expect the judge to do the same. I don't think the judge would ever go with the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  motion, but I agree with your analysis. Now the question is, strategically, if you're consulting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=146.88s)]
*  with the Trump campaign, you don't have attorney-client privilege, what advice would you give them? Would you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=152.16s)]
*  say, Michael Cohen, they didn't make their case, we rest? Or do you put on legal experts that point [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=159.2s)]
*  out no crime has been laid out in this court, there's no evidence of any crime, there's been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=165.6s)]
*  a lot of salacious material brought forward, there's been a lot of words used, conspiracy and this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=171.92s)]
*  and that. But where's the crime? And what is the charge? And where did Donald Trump, where's the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=177.28s)]
*  evidence he committed that crime? What would you do? Well, first of all, as a criminal defense [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=184.24s)]
*  attorney, I would wait to see what this redirect is like. They are confined to the parameters on the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=190.24s)]
*  cross. They can't go beyond the cross. And so they will do a redirect and you have to see what they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=196.8s)]
*  use that for. I would be very cautious not to do what was suggested at the end of today's proceedings, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=203.44s)]
*  to wrap up on Thursday afternoon. If that's a late Thursday afternoon, I would not want to give [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=212.08s)]
*  the government the chance to go over a long weekend and then do a redirect at the very end of their [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  case. That'll be the last thing the jury really sees with regard to Cohen. So this is one of those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=224.56s)]
*  situations where either you got to finish early to make sure that the government doesn't have a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=230.96s)]
*  redirect on Monday or you, it's your advantage to go a bit long and bleed into Monday. But there are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=235.68s)]
*  various witnesses here that they could use. One is Cohen's prior attorney who gave very damning [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=242.8s)]
*  evidence against Cohen. Another would be an expert witness to say this is a legal expense. This was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=249.52s)]
*  paying his fees, his costs. It was money to basically settle a potential legal dispute [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=256.8s)]
*  at an NDA. This would be noted as a legal expense. But if you're asking me what my inclination right [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=264.96s)]
*  now would be, it would be to rest. I think this case is gone. They didn't state a basis for a crime. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=273.44s)]
*  Now, Mershon may throw all of his judgment out the window. He may be blinded by who the defendant is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm hoping that he's better than that. So I would probably rest. Why would you believe that? Unless [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=290.0s)]
*  that redirect goes badly. Because you know what, I still want to give a modicum of faith to him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  I want to give a modicum of faith to the jury. It's hard for me to believe that they're not [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=302.88s)]
*  equally insulted by what we saw today. I wish I had the confidence you do. I just don't have faith [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  in a New York City jury. But I have faith in you. Jonathan Turley, thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z0q6YY2k0&t=316.16s)]
