# Newt Gingrich: Biden finds a new way to weaken America every day
**Fox News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4)
*  Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. By the way, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=0.0s)]
*  he has a new documentary coming out. It's going to be on PBS called Journey to America. I've got [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  details on my website, Hannity.com. Mr. Speaker, congratulations. Great to have you. One week from [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=8.4s)]
*  tonight, Donald Trump beat the odds. He beat the legacy media. He beat nine years of smear, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=14.64s)]
*  slander and besmirchment. And he will be called President Trump yet again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=20.72s)]
*  Well, look, I hold my breath to get through seven more days of Joe Biden. I mean, every day, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=25.44s)]
*  he seems to find a new way to weaken America, to make Trump's job harder, to assert things that are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=35.68s)]
*  patently false. And I think for the country's sake, the sooner we can get to that inauguration, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  the sooner we could wave goodbye as he goes back to Delaware, the safer the country will be. And [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=50.56s)]
*  until that happens, I frankly remain worried about what he may do in the next few days [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  that will be truly destructive. So look at California as a model. All right, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  the highest tax state, they have all of these new Green Deal boondoggles, $650 million. How do you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=68.48s)]
*  make the port of Los Angeles green with $650 million? Billions set aside for wind turbines. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=75.68s)]
*  But we have fire hydrants in a state known for wildfires, known for high winds called Santa Ana [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  winds, both very predictable. They don't practice the science of forestry. And they don't have water. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=89.68s)]
*  The reservoir in the Pacific Palisades was empty. And then they just point fingers at each other [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  and then blame Trump. Explain that to me. Sure. Look, I think what you see in California, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=103.36s)]
*  in Chicago, in Baltimore City, around the country, is you see a machine. The machine gradually gets [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=110.0s)]
*  weaker, sicker, dumber, less capable of doing anything effective. It has a set of values that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=116.8s)]
*  are weird, so that paying for art is really good, but paying for the fire department is really bad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=122.72s)]
*  Paying for whatever the latest idea that some left-wing nut has is a really good thing, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=128.96s)]
*  but paying for police is bad. And the result is all of this was avoidable. I'm confident that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=134.48s)]
*  Los Angeles will, in fact, be back just as Chicago was after the Great Fire of 1871 or as San [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=142.64s)]
*  Francisco was after the Great Earthquake of 1906. But all of this was avoidable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=151.04s)]
*  But it's- And I'm hoping that people- But, Mr. Speaker, it's 2025. We understand how [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=157.04s)]
*  to prevent forest fires. Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=162.32s)]
*  You know, we understand that you need water to put them out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=164.32s)]
*  Let me give you an example of how really stupid this is. The Reagan Library had goats [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=169.92s)]
*  that ate the shrubs. And when they had a big fire in the Simi Valley, it didn't get to the library, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=178.64s)]
*  because all of the shrubs that would have caught fire were in, had been eaten by the goats. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=185.2s)]
*  Laguna Beach right now has the same program. They have goats that eat the shrubs. This is not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=191.44s)]
*  necessarily a high-tech trillion-dollar problem. But when you have left-wing cuckoos who are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=197.2s)]
*  incompetent and who rise basically in an incestuous machine where who you know is more important than [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  what you can do, you have a steady downward decline in the ability just to be competent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=211.04s)]
*  And that's what's happening right now in California. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=217.2s)]
*  And this is where the Democratic Party would take the country if they had their way. All right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=220.16s)]
*  So Donald Trump spoke about one big, beautiful bill. Senate Republicans are talking about two [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  bills. You feel very strongly it should be one. Okay, the consensus seems to be moving towards two. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=230.56s)]
*  How can you do one or two and still get it right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=238.0s)]
*  Well, look, I'm very worried, and I'm happy to talk to the Senate Republicans, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=243.52s)]
*  I'm very worried that if they split the bills, the bill that really matters for the 2026 election [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=247.92s)]
*  is the tax cut affordability, greater take-home pay and more jobs bill. That's the one that really [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=255.28s)]
*  matters. And if we lose the House next year because the Senate refuses to pass a bill in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=261.52s)]
*  a timely way, this will be a disaster that will tie up the last two years of the Trump administration, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=268.4s)]
*  just as Nancy Pelosi did after we lost in 18. Remember, the House and Senate leaders in 18 [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=274.96s)]
*  and 17 convinced Trump to wait. They didn't pass the tax cut until December. It didn't have an [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=282.0s)]
*  effect in 18. We lost 40 seats. Now, why the Senate can't get its act together [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=288.24s)]
*  bothers me a great deal. I hope they will reverse themselves. And if they fail to pass the tax cut [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=294.64s)]
*  by Memorial Day as Speaker Johnson wants, or by July 4th, which I think is absolutely the last time, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=301.76s)]
*  then we are drifting as a party towards a really bad 2026 that's totally avoidable. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=309.52s)]
*  They'll succeed or fail together. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=315.76s)]
*  And I think it's going to take the American people calling their elections. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=319.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=322.48s)]
*  Look, the Senate's going to stay Republican in all probability. They don't have the same sense of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  urgency. And, you know, senators like to have multiple bites of the apple. But in fact, in the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=328.56s)]
*  House, you need to have one big bill. You need to have about two and a half months of President [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=334.72s)]
*  Trump stumping for it. There are 13 Democrats in seats that Trump carried, another 24 Democrats, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  21 Democrats that are in seats that he got within 5 percent. If he goes out and holds [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=346.72s)]
*  town hall meetings and rallies in those districts, just as they did this last week with the Lake and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  Riley bill, they're going to get a bunch of Democrats voting with us and we will pass the bill. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=357.6s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, we appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1uaRZSgL4&t=363.44000000000005s)]
