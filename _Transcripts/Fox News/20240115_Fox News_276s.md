# Kellyanne Conway: This is a full-scale victory for Trump
**Fox News:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A)
*  Here now with reaction we have Fox News contributors Kellyanne Conway, Ari Fleischer with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=0.0s)]
*  They were able to call this literally, you know, within seconds. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The largest margin that any previous Republican candidate had won by was Bob Dole, which was [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=9.92s)]
*  12.8 percent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=15.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=16.92s)]
*  It looks like this is going to be a much wider margin tonight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=17.92s)]
*  What are your expectations? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=22.56s)]
*  What does this do for President Trump? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=23.92s)]
*  What impact will it have on Governor DeSantis, Nikki Haley, in terms of the battle for second? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=25.64s)]
*  Look, I know there's a battle for a second, but if you look at Trump's dominance across [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=30.68s)]
*  pretty much every crosstab group he won, he's going to win young people, first time caucus [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=34.54s)]
*  goers he's going to dominate among evangelical Christians, among women. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=39.08s)]
*  Hello Nikki. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  You name it, Trump is dominating. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=44.64s)]
*  It's a full scale victory for him tonight, Sean. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Whether he gets to 50 percent or not, it doesn't matter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  So what's my expectation for them that they can carry on? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=52.06s)]
*  But I feel like tonight Trump got win-play show. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=55.44s)]
*  I mean, they're so far behind him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=58.0s)]
*  And I think when you go into a state like South Carolina, which is winner-take-all, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  where Nikki Haley was the governor a while ago now, that's where Jeb Bush and others [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  fell out of the race because Trump got, I think he got about a third of the vote, the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=69.2s)]
*  raw vote, but he got all 42 delegates coming out of South Carolina in the third contest [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=74.24s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=78.68s)]
*  This feels like 2016 in terms of the Trump hunger, swagger, being counted down, counted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=79.84s)]
*  out, underdog, underestimated, but not underfunded and understaffed this time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=85.48s)]
*  Yet it's 2016 Trump with the 2017 to 2020 record president Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=90.4s)]
*  It's a very unique position. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=96.28s)]
*  You were there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=97.48s)]
*  What has been very, very apparent to me is the organization. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=98.48s)]
*  Yes, fantastic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=102.84s)]
*  Which was nonexistent, I think you can argue, or fairly nonexistent, no offense to the people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  that worked in 2016 on his Iowa campaign, but compared now versus then, night and day, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=108.16s)]
*  wasn't it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=114.96s)]
*  No, Ivanka told me the story of her and Jared opening up folding tables and folding chairs [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=115.96s)]
*  trying to help, and she was very pregnant at the time with her third child, just trying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  to organize actual caucus areas and volunteer tables. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=124.44s)]
*  So yes, this was very different. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=128.64s)]
*  I think Susie Wiles and the team left nothing to chance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=130.28s)]
*  They put a great ground game together. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=133.16s)]
*  This Trump caucus captain hat, I think, is a great collector's item. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  But Sean, the others went to the airwaves. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=140.48s)]
*  And all these third party groups coming in late for Nikki Haley, they chose, yeah, to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=142.4s)]
*  knock on doors a little bit, but really to go to the airwaves. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=146.2s)]
*  And it's just not going to bear as much fruit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=149.04s)]
*  Look, you said something important at the top. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=150.76s)]
*  You are discussing the Trump detractors, the Trump haters, the never Trumpers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=153.1s)]
*  They look so ridiculous time after time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=157.0s)]
*  It's always the wheels coming off the bus. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=159.68s)]
*  This is the time we're going to get Donald Trump, where most voters are looking at this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=161.52s)]
*  and saying, you know, we need to get our country back on track. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=165.56s)]
*  Energy independence, the homeless out of our cities, crime that's spiraling, the price [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=168.44s)]
*  is out of control, the border, 8 million people larger than the population. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=173.28s)]
*  Almost 10 now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  We're moving to 10. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Close to 10. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  And so that's what people are saying. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And yet I think if people had spent a fraction of the time that they spent obsessing over [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  on understanding the Trump voter, then they may be competitive for Biden, but they're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=186.86s)]
*  not. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think one of the best things that ever happened to Donald Trump is Joe Biden. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  He contrasts his record to Joe Biden's record, and people are seeing that now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=196.9s)]
*  He's been in a general election strategy, I think, since last summer, calling on Biden, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=201.18s)]
*  not just making fun of his agility and ability. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  That's easy to do, but calling him out on the Afghanistan withdrawal, calling him out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=209.62s)]
*  on killing the Keystone pipeline jobs, calling him out on him and his Homeland Security director [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=212.82s)]
*  not even willing to call the border a crisis, which everyone believes it is, including [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=218.9s)]
*  a number of Democratic members of Congress and governors. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=222.22s)]
*  Really challenging Joe Biden. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=225.58s)]
*  I think there are Democrats out there who would love to run against Joe Biden, but instead, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=226.62s)]
*  I predict they're going to watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris bleed out, let Trump win [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=229.98s)]
*  it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=234.22s)]
*  And I think Trump, who got blamed 14 short months ago unfairly in the midterms, is the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=235.22s)]
*  best chance the Republican Party has to flip the Senate and retain and grow the House. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=241.02s)]
*  See, I actually believe a lot of that was based on abortion. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=246.02s)]
*  It was based on abortion, and we had some crappy candidates. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  You get Trump's endorsement, you can't fall asleep. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=250.78s)]
*  You have to do what he does. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=252.94s)]
*  You have to show up, put up, speak up, and stand up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=253.94s)]
*  He can't fall asleep in running a campaign? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=256.86s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=257.86s)]
*  His endorsement is not enough. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=258.86s)]
*  It's the ground, not the ceiling. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=259.86s)]
*  You have to go run your own campaign. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=260.86s)]
*  He's not running for governor of this state or senator from that state. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKu37pBJO-A&t=261.86s)]
