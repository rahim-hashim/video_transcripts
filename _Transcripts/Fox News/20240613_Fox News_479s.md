# Newt Gingrich: This new Biden campaign push is 'childish'
**Fox News:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE)
*  All right, breaking moments ago, so-called climate protesters stormed the field at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=0.0s)]
*  annual Congressional baseball game before getting apprehended. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We're going to continue to monitor that situation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=8.48s)]
*  But first, we do turn to Biden's campaign, which is rapidly deteriorating. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=11.16s)]
*  And to make matters worse, voters are not very keen on Kamala Harris either. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  According to a new poll, just one-third of voters and only 60 percent of Democrats think [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=20.8s)]
*  she would win a general election. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  And her favorability? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=27.5s)]
*  Well, that's similar to Biden's 10 points underwater, and Joe actually has one point [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=28.5s)]
*  higher in terms of approval. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=33.74s)]
*  Campaign is now resorting to very desperate pandering to win over voters. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=36.34s)]
*  They are launching seniors for Biden-Harris, promoting pickleball and phone banks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=40.78s)]
*  And meanwhile, Democrats simultaneously, they're trying to win back younger voters, many of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=46.46s)]
*  which are abandoning their support for Biden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=51.14s)]
*  James Carville has been screaming about this, and he can't make this up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=53.38s)]
*  How are they trying to attract young voters? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=57.78s)]
*  With beer and birth control. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=60.7s)]
*  Free beer, free birth control, and I guess free college tuition. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  Vote for us. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  The bad news for Biden doesn't end there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=70.2s)]
*  A new poll out today from Marist shows Trump leading Biden by two in the all-important [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=72.42s)]
*  swing state of Pennsylvania, which Biden did eke out in 2020, which could be the deciding [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=77.56s)]
*  state come November. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=83.4s)]
*  Things have gotten so bad for the Biden campaign, National Review writer Charles Cook is calling [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=85.4s)]
*  Biden's candidacy a, quote, decoy presidential candidacy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=90.44s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=95.44s)]
*  It's kind of hard for the vice president to have a lower approval rating than the president. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Beer and birth control and free college. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=105.12s)]
*  What a nice deal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=107.84s)]
*  Please vote for us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=108.84s)]
*  Is that going to work? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=109.84s)]
*  No. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=110.84s)]
*  I mean, look, you just lumped together two or three different things here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=111.84s)]
*  I mean, Kamala is hopeless because she's Kamala. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=119.04s)]
*  I mean, anybody who watches her knows that the idea of her being president makes Biden [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=123.44s)]
*  look good, which is really hard nowadays. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=129.88s)]
*  So you have to start with the idea that she's imprinted on the country permanently, that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=133.98s)]
*  she is a really shallow, uneducated and uneducatable person, and that other than her weird laugh, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=138.82s)]
*  there's no really significant part to it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  Now, I do think her efforts in the last month or two on abortion, running around the country [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=151.42s)]
*  on women's rights, she's actually stabilized and sounded semi-serious. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  I think basically she's a huge drag on the ticket. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=162.1s)]
*  And when you ask people, do you think Biden could survive four more years, the people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=165.98s)]
*  who say no now have to face, oh, so you're voting for Kamala Harris to be president? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=170.66s)]
*  And I think that makes it really increases the challenge for Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  I think this stuff with beer and contraception, this is childish. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=179.5s)]
*  This assumes that young people are so simple-minded that they are, they have a single point of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=185.1s)]
*  reference. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=191.02s)]
*  They don't have to, they don't think about not getting a job. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=192.02s)]
*  They don't think about not being able to buy a house. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=195.68s)]
*  They don't think about the price of groceries this week. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, they're supposed to just go, oh, my gosh, I get a free beer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Gee, I really like Joe Biden. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  That's stupid. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=207.12s)]
*  I mean, most people, most Americans are just much more complicated than the people in the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=208.12s)]
*  White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=214.68s)]
*  And that's a reality. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=215.68s)]
*  And the fact is... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=216.68s)]
*  Maybe I'm old-fashioned. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=218.1s)]
*  Is vote buying legal now? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  If you're buying beer and birth control and free college and pickleball and phone banks? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=222.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=228.32s)]
*  But that sounds like you're trying to bribe people to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=229.32s)]
*  But I come from New York. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=232.3s)]
*  I guess I'm very cynical. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=234.18s)]
*  I don't live there anymore, by the way, for the record. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=235.66s)]
*  Well, look, when George Washington first ran for office, the tradition, the tradition in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=239.3s)]
*  Virginia was everybody got together for Election Day and candidates bought free liquor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=246.4s)]
*  Washington, who'd been a military hero, thought that he was above that and refused to buy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=253.12s)]
*  any free liquor and came in last. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=257.44s)]
*  At the next election, Washington bought more free liquor than any other candidate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that's bribery or just the way they campaigned. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=265.12s)]
*  But I can tell you that this is a very deep American tradition. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=270.24s)]
*  The problem for the Democrats is it doesn't count. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=274.34s)]
*  I keep telling people, Biden inflation is so bad that you cannot buy enough ads to offset [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=279.62s)]
*  going to the grocery store. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=287.14s)]
*  And people go to the grocery store, every time Clifton and I go to the grocery store, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=289.26s)]
*  we're stunned. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=292.74s)]
*  You're either getting smaller packages or higher prices, or in some cases, you're getting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=293.74s)]
*  smaller packages and higher prices. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=299.94s)]
*  So no matter how many ads Biden buys, he's faced with the reality that most American [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  families are going to go there and they're going to realize, we were talking to someone [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  the other day who said that their friends who can no longer afford to buy Jif peanut [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  butter, they now buy the generic because literally for their family, they can't afford something [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  like Jif peanut butter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=324.24s)]
*  Well, that's a failed presidency. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think people see it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=328.96s)]
*  Unless you have a president who freezes for a full minute at a public event and you begin [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  to think, you know, to be the commander in chief is really a big job and you really have [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  to be aware and you have to be capable. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Historically, and you're the historian, peace and prosperity drive elections, okay. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's assume that that's true. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=353.9s)]
*  Ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=355.26s)]
*  You're paying about 12 grand more a year than you were paying four years ago for the exact [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  same items. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=362.68s)]
*  I don't think people are better off. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=363.68s)]
*  We'll get into some of the economic numbers, but two thirds of Americans are struggling [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  mightily to pay their bills and nearly 25 percent of Americans have have literally been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  had to forego meals because they can't afford them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  That's Biden's America. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  Then, of course, our top geopolitical foes, including people with terror ties, have been [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=382.7s)]
*  crossing our country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=387.94s)]
*  About 11 million unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  How's that working out? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=392.46s)]
*  How's defund, dismantle, no bail laws working out in small towns and big cities across the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=393.74s)]
*  country? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=398.86s)]
*  How's peace and prosperity around the world doing with war in Europe and war in the Middle [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=399.86s)]
*  East? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=403.86s)]
*  Not too well. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=404.86s)]
*  Or Joe Biden surrendering in the war on terror. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=405.86s)]
*  How's it working out with this new lawfare and the weaponization of justice? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=408.88s)]
*  To what extent does all of this cumulatively in the minds of Americans say they've had [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  enough? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you think they've had enough in 145 days? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  Will they change this? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=423.44s)]
*  Look, I think first of all, this is more than any election in my lifetime, a survival election. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=424.44s)]
*  People have to say to themselves, can I survive four more years of Joe Biden in the White [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=433.72s)]
*  House at the grocery store? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=438.54s)]
*  Can I survive four more years of my culture, my values, my country being undermined? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=440.86s)]
*  Can I survive an amazingly weak and incompetent commander in chief in a dangerous world? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6USkbuFRaE&t=447.38s)]
