# Dave McCormick: Kamala Harris' energy policies would be a 'disaster' for Pennsylvania
**Fox News:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko)
*  Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday flew a little [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=0.0s)]
*  bit under the radar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=5.54s)]
*  It came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=6.96s)]
*  on fracking. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's verifiably false. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  Harris has been anything but clear, and she now claims to love fracking out of nowhere. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=16.42s)]
*  But when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=22.82s)]
*  ban was necessary. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=28.8s)]
*  Her in her own words, something that ABC Disney could learn from. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=30.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=34.84s)]
*  Let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=35.84s)]
*  I made that very clear in 2020. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=38.24s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  And in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  new leases for fracking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=50.5s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=52.96s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=58.08s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=62.32s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=64.44s)]
*  At the debate, Harris tried to claim credit for the Biden administration's increase [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=65.44s)]
*  of fracking leases. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=71.36s)]
*  We only have one itsy bitsy teeny weeny problem. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=72.36s)]
*  That never happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=76.92s)]
*  Just like she never said in 2020, oh, I changed my position on fracking. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=78.48s)]
*  Even fake news CNN fact-checked her on that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=84.64s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=87.48s)]
*  day one. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=92.48s)]
*  And of course, she has her E.V. mandate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=93.48s)]
*  Don't you want an E.V. mandate, no plastic straws, a reduction in consumption of meat? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=95.2s)]
*  This is the party that claims they're the party of freedom, and they want to provide [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=100.48s)]
*  everything for you and take everything you have. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  That's called Marxism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, how's that going to play in the very important key swing state of Pennsylvania, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  where fracking is a huge part of the local economy? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=113.64s)]
*  Well, let's ask. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=117.16s)]
*  Pennsylvania, GOP, Senate candidate Dave McCormick is with us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=118.16s)]
*  Dave, I've been in your great Commonwealth now two weeks in a row. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=121.68s)]
*  I did have myâ€”uh-oh. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  We did have my cheesesteak when I was there both times and enjoy it a lot, especially [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=129.96s)]
*  the one in Philly that I got from Geno's. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=138.76s)]
*  All right, let's talk about fracking. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=141.72s)]
*  What does that mean to your state? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, Sean, this is the single most important industry. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=145.44s)]
*  We have 600,000 jobs in Pennsylvania from fracking, but that's just the beginning of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=153.16s)]
*  what it could be if we had energy dominance and unlocked the potential. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=157.04s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has said many times over that she wanted to ban fracking and transition [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=160.6s)]
*  energy workers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  My opponent, Bob Casey, has said that he wants to transition energy workers, and he's voted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  99 percent of the time with Biden and Harris. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=171.12s)]
*  This would be a disaster for Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvanians do not believe Kamala Harris [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=173.8s)]
*  will not come after fossil fuels. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  As you said, the EP mandate mandates that by 20, 32, 70 percent of all new light vehicles [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=182.08s)]
*  are EVs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  This would be a disaster for manufacturing in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  The ban on fracking a disaster. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  Pennsylvanians cannot trust Kamala Harris or Bob Casey on the most critical industry for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  their future. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=199.36s)]
*  It's the lifeblood of the world's economy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  It just is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm not against electric vehicles, but I'm against forcing a company like Ford to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  invest in electric vehicles because the government is pushing them to do it and losing four and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  a half billion dollars when you have other great companies like Tesla, for example, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=216.12s)]
*  the people that want electric vehicles can have them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  What do these jobs mean? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=225.52s)]
*  I mean, if you have a job in Pennsylvania in the fracking industry, what kind of money [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=226.84s)]
*  are you making annually? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=232.64s)]
*  Well, listen, these entry level jobs, these are people that get technical degrees as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=236.44s)]
*  mechanics or welders. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=241.0s)]
*  They start sixty five, seventy thousand dollars a year plus overtime. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=243.64s)]
*  These are great paying jobs that can go on for decades and create great opportunity. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=247.76s)]
*  The American dream for Pennsylvania workers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=253.48s)]
*  There's mechanics, there's restaurants, there's bars, there's truck drivers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=255.72s)]
*  It's a huge industry, but it's not just the present jobs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=259.48s)]
*  It's the future jobs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=263.4s)]
*  Pennsylvania has got the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=264.6s)]
*  I want to see more about this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=268.84s)]
*  You go to my website, Dave McCormick, PA dot com. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=270.8s)]
*  But this is the one thing we could do that would change Pennsylvania's future. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=273.56s)]
*  We really haven't taken advantage of it yet. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=277.8s)]
*  Under Kamala Harris and and Bob Casey, it's a disastrous future for fracking in our energy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=279.92s)]
*  sector in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=286.04s)]
*  And with Donald Trump's proposal today, look, I know a lot of guys in the energy sector [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  that work in either oil or gas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=293.88s)]
*  And, you know, they're working 80 hour weeks, sometimes even more. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=295.84s)]
*  Could you imagine after 40 hours, you get time and a half and no tax on that time and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=300.76s)]
*  a half money? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=306.0s)]
*  That's called wealth creation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=307.0s)]
*  That's the opportunity of a lifetime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a Donald Trump idea. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  That'll be a big hit. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Just like no tax on tips. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  That'll be a big hit, Sean. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be huge. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=316.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  And you support that, right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  And you said it well. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this inflation has been a 22 percent or greater tax on working families, on people [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=325.68s)]
*  on fixed income. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=332.0s)]
*  It's been devastating. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  This is one way to offset that by giving tax benefits on overtime. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  No tax on tips. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=339.36s)]
*  This is great things for working families in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=340.56s)]
*  And no tax on Social Security. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=344.04s)]
*  Let's see how Kamala lies about that tomorrow. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=346.24s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTtGqKL9Ko&t=348.48s)]
