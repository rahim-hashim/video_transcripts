# Ted Cruz: Judge Merchan's jury instructions were 'nonsense'
**Fox News:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA)
*  Joining us now with more is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Alan Dershowitz says you're one of his favorite law students of all time and one of his best and brightest. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=4.4s)]
*  Your take on all the things we've been discussing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=9.84s)]
*  Well, listen, Sean, I've got good news and bad news. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=14.56s)]
*  The good news is the exchange you were just having with Jonathan Turley is exactly right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=16.76s)]
*  We now know to a virtual certainty that no conviction will be upheld on appeal, that the judge today [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=21.04s)]
*  committed, I think, clear reversible error. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=27.8s)]
*  These jury instructions were nonsense. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=30.32s)]
*  Now, here's the bad news. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=33.28s)]
*  The bad news is this has been a kangaroo court from the beginning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=34.76s)]
*  This is a wildly partisan prosecutor who hates Donald Trump, who came with a political objective of going after Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=39.72s)]
*  And we now know from these jury instructions that this judge is every bit the partisan that the prosecutor is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=46.84s)]
*  And he knows this is reversible error. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=53.36s)]
*  As you noted, Ramos versus Louisiana clearly held in 2020 that every element of the crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=55.24s)]
*  must be unanimous by the jury. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=63.56s)]
*  And yet this judge says it doesn't matter. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=66.2s)]
*  Not in New York. The Constitution does not apply in New York, which means if we get a conviction, it will be reversed on appeal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=68.44s)]
*  But the judge doesn't care. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=76.48s)]
*  The prosecutor doesn't care. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=79.16s)]
*  Nobody cares because this is not about law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  This is not about criminal justice. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=82.92s)]
*  This is about politics. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=84.48s)]
*  This is all about the press conference, the national address that Joe Biden is scheduled to give from the White House, where he gloats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  We've now convicted Donald Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=94.4s)]
*  This is all about November. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  We are watching election interference. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=98.16s)]
*  This is the most blatant case of election interference that we've ever seen in our country's history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=100.56s)]
*  But everything seems to backfire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  And if you look, for example, and I've heard different takes on the issue of the questions that the jury will, well, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  are asking and there'll be a readback tomorrow. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  But I've got to wonder, could those questions be rooted in disagreement in that jury room? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=120.48s)]
*  Look, Sean, I'm holding out hope. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  I got to say, I believe in our justice system. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=131.36s)]
*  I believe in our Constitution. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=133.56s)]
*  I believe in the rule of law. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=134.88s)]
*  I don't believe in this system. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  Senator, I don't believe. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=139.04s)]
*  I said in the beginning he can't get a fair trial in New York. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago is not $18 million either. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  And I stand by it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=146.28s)]
*  And he didn't get a fair trial in New York, regardless of what the outcome is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=147.76s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=153.56s)]
*  This judge is partisan and wildly unfair. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=154.48s)]
*  The previous judge was partisan and wildly unfair. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=156.92s)]
*  My hope is the best outcome is that the jury acquits, that there's some common sense that comes through. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=159.72s)]
*  Now, as you noted, this jury pool is wildly Democratic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=165.48s)]
*  So they're gambling that they have partisans on that jury who don't care about the facts in law. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=168.92s)]
*  And by the way, the judge gave them such a biased view of the law that they can have 12 different theories of the crime and convict. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=173.84s)]
*  That will be reversed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=179.84s)]
*  But even so, even if they don't acquit, one juror can stand up and say, I will not be part of this travesty of justice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=181.2s)]
*  I hope and pray that happens. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=189.64s)]
*  That would be good for the country if they ended this ridiculous charade. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=191.0s)]
*  And they let the voters decide in November. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=195.32s)]
*  I agree. Well said, Senator. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=198.92s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT7AHXscVeA&t=200.48s)]
