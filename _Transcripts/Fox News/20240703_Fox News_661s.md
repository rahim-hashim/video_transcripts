# Karoline Leavitt: Democratic Party is 'collapsing before our eyes'
**Fox News:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ)
*  In the meantime, I can report tonight that House Committee Overseas Chairman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=0.0s)]
*  James Comer, is preparing to bring the White House physician before Congress [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=5.0s)]
*  to possibly answer a few questions. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=10.5s)]
*  Here now with reaction, Trump 2024 National Press Secretary, Caroline Levitt, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=13.8s)]
*  along with the Monica Crowley podcast host, Monica Crowley, and Democratic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  pollster and former Clinton advisor, Doug Schoen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=23.8s)]
*  Caroline, let's go to you first. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=27.6s)]
*  We'd really love to get the input of how Donald Trump sees things because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  it's got to be tempting to just tee off, but there's some wisdom and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=34.5s)]
*  just kind of being quiet about this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, President Trump and our campaign see what the rest of America sees, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=41.5s)]
*  and that is Joe Biden is not qualified to be president of the United [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  States for another four years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=49.2s)]
*  He is far too incompetent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=50.7s)]
*  He is far too weak and he is dishonest. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  He is dishonest and last Thursday exposed the dishonesty, the lies, the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=55.0s)]
*  corruption of the Democrat Party and also their allies in the mainstream [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=59.7s)]
*  media who have been lying to the American public for the past four years [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=63.6s)]
*  about Joe Biden's cognitive decline that we have been calling out that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=67.6s)]
*  President Trump has been speaking truth about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=71.5s)]
*  But the Biden campaign pointed the finger at us and said we were in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=73.8s)]
*  lying. We were engaging in cheap fakes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=77.1s)]
*  There's nothing cheap or fake about Joe Biden's mental state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=79.2s)]
*  Not only does our country see it, but the world sees it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=83.3s)]
*  Joe Biden is a national security risk. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=86.2s)]
*  The Democrat Party is in crisis mode. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=88.6s)]
*  They are collapsing before our eyes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=90.6s)]
*  As for our campaign, President Trump just out raised Joe Biden in his [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  campaign and the Democrats. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=96.0s)]
*  He has all of the momentum in the polls. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=97.6s)]
*  He's leading Joe Biden by six in the latest CNN poll and he's also leading [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=99.4s)]
*  every other Democrat contender that the chattering class in Washington, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=103.2s)]
*  DC is talking about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=106.8s)]
*  He is on his way to victory because this country needs a strong leader [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=108.0s)]
*  and President Trump is that leader. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=111.7s)]
*  So Doug, there was a critical meeting at the White House. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=113.3s)]
*  You have these Democratic governors. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Only three of them came out to the microphone. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  You would think if they were united, they would have all come out to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=123.1s)]
*  the microphone to voice their support. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  But what was your read of that meeting and how critical is it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=127.7s)]
*  I mean days have passed and the president really has not addressed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=131.0s)]
*  the elephant in the room, which is his cognitive decline and his physical [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=134.5s)]
*  ability to actually be the president of the United States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=137.8s)]
*  I see this as another nail in his coffin. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=141.7s)]
*  Plus the Wall Street Journal poll, the New York Times poll, both out [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  today at six points for Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  I think my party, the Democratic Party, their only chance of winning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  is to have Biden off the ticket and to have an open convention. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris, if she gets the nomination, would be a loser too. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=163.1s)]
*  The only way my party can win is to have a fair, open, transparent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=169.1s)]
*  nominating process like we haven't seen in many, many years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=175.0s)]
*  Do I think it's going to happen? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=179.3s)]
*  No. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=180.9s)]
*  Does Biden have to get out? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=181.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=183.1s)]
*  Monica, I mean Doug tackles it straight on, which is what we like about Doug. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=185.8s)]
*  I still, I can't understand why all the Democratic governors [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  didn't come out to the microphone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=195.0s)]
*  I'm anxious to hear what they have to say. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=196.4s)]
*  They sat with him in the room. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  You're going to voice your support for the president after meeting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=199.9s)]
*  with them one-on-one and that debate performance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=202.4s)]
*  This is on you too, because if you're going to be part of the coverup, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=205.1s)]
*  you're going to be part of the denial. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=208.3s)]
*  Hey, you know, we're going to remember those things. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=214.8s)]
*  And you know, it looks like now the Democrats are going full game [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=216.1s)]
*  of Thrones to try to succeed Joe Biden. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's why you saw with just a handful of governors come out to the sticks [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=222.4s)]
*  after that meeting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=227.5s)]
*  You didn't see any of the major governors, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=228.6s)]
*  You didn't see Newsom. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=231.9s)]
*  You did not see Whitmer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=233.3s)]
*  You did not see Pritzker. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=234.8s)]
*  You did not see Murphy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=236.4s)]
*  So any of the key Democrat governors did not come out to the sticks [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=238.1s)]
*  because they're all in competition for his job. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=243.0s)]
*  Look, there's absolute panic in the Democrat Party now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  They're looking at these polls. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  They're looking at down ticket races as well being threatened by a huge drag [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=250.89999999999998s)]
*  at the top of the ticket. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=255.6s)]
*  And on top of that, right now we have a national security crisis with an [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=257.0s)]
*  incapacitated president at the top and is bleeding now into a constitutional [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  crisis about what to do next. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=266.3s)]
*  So this is not just limited to the Democrats drama and who might succeed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=268.8s)]
*  Remember, whoever succeeds Joe Biden, if in fact he steps aside, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=273.7s)]
*  which I'm not so sure he's going to go gently into that good night, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=277.4s)]
*  but remember the agenda stays the same. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  This is a far left catastrophic agenda for the United States. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=283.9s)]
*  So it really doesn't matter who is at the top of the Democrats ticket. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, to that point, Monique, you make a really good one. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=293.5s)]
*  But Caroline, the governors that did come out to the microphone, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=296.2s)]
*  they did not address the number one issue, which is the physical and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=300.2s)]
*  cognitive capability of the president. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  They did not tackle that head on. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=306.2s)]
*  I went back and read their remarks real quick, watched it again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=307.8s)]
*  They did not address that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=311.0s)]
*  And number two, to Monica's point, what issue do the Democrats think [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=312.2s)]
*  they're going to run on? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=316.3s)]
*  Because they're upside down and backwards on every single issue. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=317.0s)]
*  There is a reason why Donald Trump was kicking their butt before the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=320.3s)]
*  debate, destroys them at the debate. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=323.7s)]
*  And, you know, they got Joe Biden over there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=326.5s)]
*  They can't make an argument for any sort of policy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=329.3s)]
*  And I hope Republicans actually focus on policy because that's where [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=334.2s)]
*  I think the real differences will lie. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=337.7s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=341.7s)]
*  And the Democrat Party, as especially proven in the last week, is the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=342.8s)]
*  party of chaos. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=346.3s)]
*  And this country has seen a lot of chaos from Joe Biden's terrible [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  policies over the last four years, whether it's been the chaos at the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=351.7s)]
*  southern border, an invasion of illegal criminals and terrorists from [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=355.2s)]
*  every country all over this world, increased crime in our communities, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=358.5s)]
*  chaos in our economy where hardworking families cannot afford rent, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  groceries and gasoline because their wages are not keeping up with the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=366.5s)]
*  pace of Biden inflation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=370.0s)]
*  We have chaos abroad, war in Ukraine, war in the Middle East. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  None of this was happening under Donald Trump a few years ago. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=374.6s)]
*  And so it does not matter who is at the top of the Democrats ticket on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  November the 5th because every single Democrat has wholeheartedly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  supported Joe Biden in his implementation of these terrible policies [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=386.0s)]
*  that have led to chaos and destruction of our country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=390.0s)]
*  And President Trump stands for common sense, which is something we so [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=392.8s)]
*  desperately need to reinstill in this country right now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=396.6s)]
*  He stands for law and order, supporting law enforcement in our communities. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=399.4s)]
*  He stands for a secure border, bringing down the cost of living and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=403.1s)]
*  peace through strength across this world. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=406.3s)]
*  That is a winning message. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=409.2s)]
*  And that's why he's going to be victorious and good luck to the Democrats [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=410.4s)]
*  because they have a mess on their hands. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=414.2s)]
*  So Doug and Monica, same question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=416.8s)]
*  I want to go to you, Doug, first to answer this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=419.7s)]
*  It seems to me, and again, look, I see things through a very conservative [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  lens, I get it, but it seems to me that they have been lying to the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=426.8s)]
*  American people for the last three and a half years. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  They said inflation was transitory. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=434.5s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  They said that the border is safe, secure and they have operational [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=438.5s)]
*  control and it hasn't. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  They say things about overseas that just aren't true. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=443.1s)]
*  They tell us the president is vibrant and running, you know, doing [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=447.5s)]
*  gymnastics around everybody. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=450.5s)]
*  That's obviously not true. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=452.0s)]
*  So at some point, the credibility of the Democrats was lost in a big way. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=453.5s)]
*  I don't know how you restore that when you've lied to the American [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  people for the last three and a half years. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I would say this, Jason, the Democrats are behind, as you say, on [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=464.1s)]
*  every key issue, the economy, inflation, the border, immigration [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=469.7s)]
*  crime. That's why I believe we need a fresh face with a fresh agenda. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=474.7s)]
*  Maybe it works. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=479.9s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=480.8s)]
*  But this is a losing hand that has to be changed with a different [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  person at the top of the ticket with a different message responsive [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=487.8s)]
*  to the concerns of the American people, not the concerns of the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=492.2s)]
*  far left. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=496.2s)]
*  Monica, same question to you, but you know what Democrats maybe should [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=497.0s)]
*  have thought of or taken Doug's advice a year ago because I've been [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=502.7s)]
*  saying for a year, I didn't think Joe Biden would be the Democratic [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=506.7s)]
*  nominee for president. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=510.0s)]
*  I just didn't think he had the physical or cognitive capabilities a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=511.1s)]
*  year ago and I thought he'd bow out, but they made this nest. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=514.7s)]
*  Now they got to live in it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=519.2s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=523.2s)]
*  And look, we all knew four years ago when they kept him in the basement [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=524.2s)]
*  and used COVID as the cover story for keeping him in the basement and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=528.1s)]
*  away from the American people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=531.9000000000001s)]
*  We all knew that he was out to lunch back then. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=533.6s)]
*  And here we are three and a half years later with an absolute national [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=537.0s)]
*  catastrophe on our hands because of his failures of leadership and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=540.5s)]
*  actual deliberate torpedoing of the country here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  So look, Joe Biden was the perfect puppet for all of these [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=548.6s)]
*  revolutionaries. If they thought that they could push him through and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=552.5s)]
*  sneak him past the American people a second time this time, they would [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=556.3s)]
*  absolutely do it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=560.2s)]
*  But what that catastrophic debate performance showed is that they can [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=561.5s)]
*  no longer hide it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=565.3s)]
*  They can no longer keep that big lie, the actual big lie about Joe Biden's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=566.7s)]
*  incapacitation. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=572.5s)]
*  They can't keep that lie going. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=574.1s)]
*  And so they're mad that they can't keep it going, not that the lie was, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=576.2s)]
*  you know, that there was a lie to begin with. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  Everybody with eyes and ears can see it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=582.6s)]
*  And now the Democrats are in quite the predicament because they pushed [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=585.0s)]
*  the envelope to try to get him past the American people a second time so [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=588.6s)]
*  that they could keep this whole puppet act going and keep their whole [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  agenda going through. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  And now it looks like it is failing on their part. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=598.7s)]
*  And the question now is can they get somebody else in there at this late [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  hour to energize their base and get the money coming back into the Democrats [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=606.1s)]
*  again? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=611.0s)]
*  Yeah, they try to say, oh, it was a bad night. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=613.0s)]
*  Everybody says, oh, it was a bad night. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=615.2s)]
*  A bad night's when LeBron James only scores, you know, four points. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=616.8s)]
*  Okay, that's a bad night. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=620.3s)]
*  But this is disastrous and dangerous for the United States of America. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=621.5s)]
*  And how dare they, they say, oh, it was just a bad night. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=625.4s)]
*  This guy cannot take a phone call at three o'clock in the morning and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=628.6s)]
*  make a split-second decision that affects the safety and security of our [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=631.6s)]
*  troops overseas. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=635.2s)]
*  You remember, you know, the ones that he doesn't think died under his watch, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, the 18 of them that did die. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=640.0s)]
*  That's what's just so disastrous about this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  Caroline, Monica, Doug, thank you so much for joining us on Hannity tonight. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBsBHVK7-AQ&t=645.0s)]
