# Pollster: This is just the tip of the iceberg
**Fox News:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM)
*  This won't come as a surprise, but the first post-debate polls show a massive swing toward [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=5.16s)]
*  According to a new survey from St. Anselm College, Trump is now up two points in New [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=6.68s)]
*  Hampshire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=11.16s)]
*  That's a 12-point swing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=12.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, the debate sponsor CNN came out with a new poll, and it shows Trump increasing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=14.0s)]
*  his lead nationwide. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=19.3s)]
*  Most voters in that poll indicate that Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=21.6s)]
*  House if Biden is not the nominee. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=25.36s)]
*  The word electability that used to vex Donald Trump is now being applied to Joe Biden. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=28.64s)]
*  Nate Silver's latest forecast confirms this sentiment, finding that Trump has a 72 percent [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=33.52s)]
*  chance of winning in November. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=38.88s)]
*  Remarkable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=41.2s)]
*  Joining us now to dig into the numbers polls were Lee Carter and also Trump 2024 deputy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=42.2s)]
*  campaign communications director Caroline Sunshine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=48.28s)]
*  It's really nice to have both of you join us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=52.36s)]
*  Lee Carter, we're just starting to get the new numbers in from the post-debate polls, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=55.12s)]
*  and it looks like everything is coming up Trump. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=61.16s)]
*  But I think that's one side, I'll add to the other side, is that everything is down [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=63.92s)]
*  for Biden, which are two very different things. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  How would someone like Joe Biden be able to recover from poll numbers that are generated [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=69.4s)]
*  by what we saw, his cognitive decline? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=73.2s)]
*  The only way that he's going to recover from this is if he can demonstrate that he's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=75.16s)]
*  hold a conversation, that he is able to have a press conference, take questions, be able [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=81.64s)]
*  to do the job. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=87.76s)]
*  People's concern about Joe Biden is significant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=88.76s)]
*  When I had the focus group live on debate night, we had Democrats, independents, Republicans, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=91.36s)]
*  all of whom jaws were dropping and they were so concerned. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=99.32s)]
*  Nothing that Joe Biden has done so far has alleviated the concern. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=103.88s)]
*  He went on Friday, he did his rally in North Carolina. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  We haven't heard from him unscripted yet. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=110.04s)]
*  We're not going to hear from him until Sunday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  He's got to be out there changing the narrative. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=114.04s)]
*  The question is actually getting worse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  People are saying, is he even capable of changing the narrative? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  What's really going on here? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=121.68s)]
*  And so until he's able to do that, I think that this is just the tip of the iceberg in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=123.2s)]
*  his polls. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  I think we're going to see them get worse and worse. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=128.16s)]
*  Of our undecided voters that we had in the focus group, there were five of them, four [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=129.76s)]
*  of them switched to Donald Trump that night. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=133.4s)]
*  Not all of them were Republicans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=136.08s)]
*  Three of them were independents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=137.76s)]
*  One was a Democrat. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=139.12s)]
*  And they said that they could not vote for Joe Biden after watching that debate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=140.12s)]
*  And I think we're just we're going to continue to see this until either a change happens [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=144.4s)]
*  or something gets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=148.8s)]
*  And Caroline Sunshine, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=151.96s)]
*  I see this contrast. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=154.24s)]
*  Lee touched on it, that Joe Biden is not doing press conference. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  He's not taking the tough questions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=158.52s)]
*  He's not really giving unscripted interviews spontaneously. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=159.52s)]
*  He's also apparently not talking to members of his own party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=162.96s)]
*  He's yet to reach out as of tonight to Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the House, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=166.32s)]
*  a poised to be speaker if Joe Biden has some kind of wave. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=171.2s)]
*  How is that working? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=175.76s)]
*  You're with Donald Trump most days, and you know he's constantly working the phones [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=176.76s)]
*  with members of Congress, with members of his own party, with Senate candidates, with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=180.72s)]
*  governors, because when you are the nominee, you are the leader of the party. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=183.76s)]
*  And it just strikes me that Joe Biden's making a huge mistake by isolating himself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=188.44s)]
*  What's the how are you dealing with what's been really the best week for Donald Trump [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=193.44s)]
*  in quite some time with Supreme Court decisions, with the debate, obviously, with the polls [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=197.84s)]
*  pre debate and now post debate? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=202.28s)]
*  Are you keeping it humble, putting your head down and trying to win or celebrating a little? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, I can tell you the conversations that our campaign and our party are having are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  very different from the Democrats' panic and disarray. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  We couldn't be prouder to have President Trump as our nominee. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=217.82s)]
*  He has unified and inspired our party, and our conversations are about how much money [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  we're raising, about the liberal reporters in our inboxes asking us how we are celebrating [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=227.72s)]
*  and capitalizing off of so much winning in one week. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=233.2s)]
*  We are thinking about which states, like Virginia and Minnesota, that we're going to flip, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=236.92s)]
*  and we are thinking about which big, beautiful, massive crowd we are going to put President [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump and his winning message in front of next. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=246.12s)]
*  President Trump continues to win for our party, for our movement, for Jocelyn Nungare, for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=249.56s)]
*  Laken Riley, for Rachel Morin, and he's going to keep winning on behalf of all the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  forgotten men and women of our country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=258.76s)]
*  He's lucky to have you, Caroline. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=260.52s)]
*  And Lee, on that matter of expanding the map, it seems like Joe Biden may be contracting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  his map. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=267.7s)]
*  Do you see a route for him in North Carolina at this point? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=268.7s)]
*  What about Nevada, which hasn't gone Republican at the presidential level since 2004, but where [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=270.92s)]
*  Trump has been consistently ahead, as he is in other more racially diverse states? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=276.32s)]
*  Can you think of any state where Joe Biden can actually expand his map? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=281.12s)]
*  No. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=284.92s)]
*  In fact, things are looking really, really bleak. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=285.92s)]
*  They're getting worse. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=288.92s)]
*  We didn't expect to see poll numbers like this in North Carolina and Nevada, and Trump [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=289.92s)]
*  is winning in those states. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=292.64s)]
*  I mean, look at what's happening in New Hampshire. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=293.64s)]
*  We've never seen—we haven't seen a Republican win New Hampshire in years, and yet here we [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=295.44s)]
*  are. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=299.56s)]
*  When you look back at the polling, you pointed out in 2016 a lot of the pollsters had things [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=300.56s)]
*  wrong. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=304.16s)]
*  In 2016, 2020, Donald Trump was never leading in the polls. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=305.6s)]
*  Anyone who said that he was going to win was doing that understanding that the polls might [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  underestimate him. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=312.56s)]
*  He always overperforms the polls. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=313.94s)]
*  He did so in 2016. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=316.36s)]
*  He even outperformed the polls in 2020, who expected Joe Biden to win on a landslide. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  Nobody expected it to be as close as it was. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=324.86s)]
*  We haven't seen Joe Biden ahead in the polls really since April. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=326.56s)]
*  Things are getting worse and worse, and I think we're going to see some real shifts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=330.04s)]
*  And we're seeing shifts among some audiences you wouldn't expect. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  We're seeing shifts in voters—black voters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=336.24s)]
*  We're seeing shifts in Hispanic voters. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  We're seeing shifts even in female voters, which I don't think was expected. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=340.4s)]
*  And so, you know, across the board, I think the path for Joe Biden looks worse and worse. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=344.08s)]
*  Yeah, so it seems to be a new gender gap in American politics, even if that biased media [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  doesn't cover it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's Biden and the Democrats' problem with men. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  He's really dipping terribly among men, even before the debate. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=355.88s)]
*  I think this is a very important conversation to have. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=361.04s)]
*  Who's expanding? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=363.2s)]
*  Who's contracting their maps? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=364.2s)]
*  We, of course, will all be watching. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=365.2s)]
*  We're watching those hot Senate races right now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=366.4s)]
*  The Democrats are leading Republicans in many places. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=368.2s)]
*  Lee Carter, Caroline Sunshine, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAEKLEv9BM&t=371.64s)]
