# This is Biden’s border ‘bloodbath’: Steven Miller
**Fox News:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4)
*  former senior White House aide to President Trump Stephen Miller, podcast host Tudor Dixon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller, you have been on this from day one, rightly so, and here we are. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=5.44s)]
*  And you know what? Most Americans don't know the names of all of these victims. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=10.96s)]
*  They don't keep statistics on these victims. Your take. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=16.48s)]
*  They don't keep statistics. They don't talk about from this White House, from the White House press [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  podium, from Joe Biden's mouth. They do not talk about the countless Americans who have been [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=28.48s)]
*  burglarized, beaten, raped, and yes, murdered by Joe Biden's illegal aliens, the illegal aliens that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=34.24s)]
*  he let into the country. Your own Bill Mollusion just reported another case where Joe Biden freed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=41.44s)]
*  an illegal alien Venezuelan gang member who is now charged in a drive by shooting. We are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=48.32s)]
*  transplanting criminal syndicates, Sean, into the United States of America, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=57.04s)]
*  wreaking havoc all across this country. It is Biden's border bloodbath. That is what is happening [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=63.2s)]
*  in America and it is only going to get worse. We are just seeing the beginning of the horrors [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=71.2s)]
*  that are being unleashed by Joe Biden's erased and eradicated border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=76.8s)]
*  You know, in your state of Michigan, Tudor Dixon, $500 a month rent for illegal immigrants, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=82.64s)]
*  and you have an illegal immigrant now charged in killing a woman in Michigan in a carjacking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=88.64s)]
*  that apparently went wrong. I guess maybe the person didn't give up the car fast enough. I'm [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  not sure, but this is just one of the latest examples of violent crime and murder that are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=100.0s)]
*  being committed by Joe Biden's unvetted illegal immigrants now at nearly $10 million, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=107.84s)]
*  including from countries like Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan and Russia and China. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=113.84s)]
*  Your reaction? Yes, it's devastating. It's devastating what happened in Michigan, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  and this is something that's going to continue happening because as long as we have people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  unvetted coming across our border, your daughters, your sons, your children, your parents, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=129.36s)]
*  they're not safe in this America because any time they turn around, there could be someone [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  dangerous around the corner because we are just letting anybody in right now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  You take a look at that $500 a month. Gretchen Whitmer right now is saying, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=144.8s)]
*  oh yeah, take somebody into your home and the state will pay you $500 a month for taking an [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  illegal immigrant into your home. We aren't going to vet them. There's no rules to this game, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=154.56s)]
*  and she doesn't know who's taking them in. You are putting people in danger on both sides. You [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  don't know what the people are like that are going to take people into their home, what they'll do to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=164.56s)]
*  them or vice versa. Who's going into these people's homes? And yet no one in the mainstream media is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=168.32s)]
*  saying what governor would put this kind of a bill together and sign it and say that yes, she's going [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=174.0s)]
*  to take taxpayer money and put money into people's hands who desperately need money to take illegal [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=180.8s)]
*  immigrants into their homes. And you know what else is sick? We have not heard from a single [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=187.28s)]
*  Democrat in the state about what happened to Ruby Garcia. Say her name, Gretchen Whitmer. Say her name. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=191.68s)]
*  Agreed. And I will say this, Joe Biden has allowed this to continue. They've lied about it for three [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=199.6s)]
*  years. They said the border is closed and the border is secure. Now they're blaming Republicans, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=205.6s)]
*  but they have blood on their hands. They are responsible. They inherited the most secure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=210.4s)]
*  border ever. And now we have people, terror cells setting up in America, plotting, planning, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=215.76s)]
*  and scheming. Another 9-11 or worse. God help us. I hope I'm wrong. Anyway, thank you both. When we come back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGGbEe-HTh4&t=221.51999999999998s)]
