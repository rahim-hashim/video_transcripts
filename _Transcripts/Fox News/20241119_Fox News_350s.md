# Trump incoming White House press secretary ready for 'hostile' press corps
**Fox News:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ)
*  The next White House press secretary, spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition, Caroline Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Did I read you're going to be the youngest person to ever hold that position? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=6.92s)]
*  That is correct, Sean, yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=14.24s)]
*  Congratulations, number one. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=15.24s)]
*  You do know that you're walking into hostile territory, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Certainly do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=23.28s)]
*  And look, I think I'm well prepared for that, and I'm incredibly honored that President [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=24.28s)]
*  Trump has instilled confidence in me to speak on his behalf behind the White House podium. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=28.24s)]
*  It's been an honor to have a front row seat to the greatest political comeback in history. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=33.4s)]
*  And as you mentioned in your monologue, Sean, President Trump is putting together a brilliant [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=37.8s)]
*  cabinet of fantastic America first fighters from Elon Musk and Vivek Rameswamy, who are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=43.64s)]
*  going to cut the waste out of our federal bureaucracy, to Suzy Wiles, who is going to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=49.16s)]
*  serve as the first female chief of staff in history. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=53.68s)]
*  Take that, Mark Cuban. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=56.72s)]
*  No one better to secure the border than him. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=59.08s)]
*  And I'm so excited to speak on behalf of a president who just received a resounding mandate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=62.12s)]
*  from the American people to deliver on the promises that he made on the campaign trail. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=67.16s)]
*  We have the House, we have the Senate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=72.2s)]
*  President Trump is going to get to work on day one to implement real change that will [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=74.32s)]
*  deliver real relief and support to the American people who are struggling right now under [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=78.24s)]
*  the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  The death of legacy media, and I define that by three major networks, every major newspaper, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=85.76s)]
*  New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times, USA Today, All Against the President, NBC, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=92.6s)]
*  ABC, CBS, all these liberal cable channels, every late night comedy show, with the exception [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=98.28s)]
*  of Greg Gutfeld, the only one that is funny and has ratings. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And I put it all together, and I thought that R.E. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=106.52s)]
*  Fleischer, former White House press secretary himself, had a great idea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=110.88s)]
*  Why don't you push the old legacy media that nobody is really listening to anyway, and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=114.88s)]
*  why don't you put new media in the front of the room? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, you have the ability to make seating arrangements, don't you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=122.96s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=127.56s)]
*  We sure do. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=129.72s)]
*  And I will say, there's no greater advocate for free and fair press than Donald Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=130.8s)]
*  During his first term as president, he was the most transparent president in American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=135.8s)]
*  that continued on the campaign trail, despite the fact that he has exposed the media for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=140.2s)]
*  being incredibly hostile and fake. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=145.52s)]
*  They have pushed lies and hoaxes about him for eight years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=148.28s)]
*  They consistently take his words out of context. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=151.64s)]
*  This election taught us a lot of things, but one of those things is that the American people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=154.32s)]
*  are no longer buying the lies from the legacy media, and Americans are digesting their news [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=158.48s)]
*  in various different forms. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=164.92s)]
*  We saw President Trump own that lane on the campaign trail, sitting down with the number [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=167.0s)]
*  one podcasts in this world and ratings bonanza every time he did it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=171.6s)]
*  That's how Americans are consuming their news these days. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=176.92s)]
*  So we will certainly look at options on how to respect the tradition of the White House [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=179.12s)]
*  while also ensuring that press briefing room reflects the media habits of the American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=183.36s)]
*  people today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=187.72s)]
*  And just like we did on the campaign trail, President Trump is serving the American people, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=188.96s)]
*  and we want to make sure we are getting his message out as effectively as possible to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=193.2s)]
*  the American people he is serving. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  Under Trump's first term, the role of press secretary, I think, changed somewhat dramatically [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  in as much as nobody speaks to the press about Donald Trump better than Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  So it's a tough position that you're being put in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=213.04s)]
*  Have you given thought as to whether or not there'll be daily White House briefings [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=214.04s)]
*  or occasional White House briefings or on an as-needed basis? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=217.88s)]
*  Have you thought about that at all? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=222.84s)]
*  That's certainly something I'll discuss with President Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=226.32s)]
*  Ultimately, he is the decision-maker, as you know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  That was the way in his first White House. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=231.04s)]
*  It was the way on our campaign, and I will defer to him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=232.52s)]
*  But like I said as well, in his first term, he was the most transparent president in history. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  He often brought the press into the Oval Office when he was signing bills. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=239.8s)]
*  He did Rose Garden press conferences. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=243.84s)]
*  In fact, during the COVID pandemic, President Trump briefed the press in the James S. Brady [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  briefing room 72 days in a row. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of the fake news reporters will tell you behind the scenes, Sean, they missed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=253.18s)]
*  that transparency and that access to the leader of the free world, and I know President Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=256.94s)]
*  will provide that to them again. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=261.42s)]
*  OK, so are there going to be rules in your press when you deal with the press? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  In other words, you're dealing with somebody that's rude, that's interruptive, that wants [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=269.66s)]
*  to ask five questions, not one question. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=274.74s)]
*  Are you going to set up rules? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, we hope there will be decorum, certainly, and we will try to instill that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=280.3s)]
*  But we're not we're not shy of the hostile media. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=285.3s)]
*  We've dealt with that now in the campaign for the last year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=289.02s)]
*  Nobody does it better than President Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=291.42s)]
*  And again, it's our goal to get our message, his message, his America first message and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=293.98s)]
*  the historic policies that he will be delivering upon in the most effective way to the American [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  people. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=304.58s)]
*  That may include bringing different voices into the press briefing room. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=305.58s)]
*  That may include some different rules. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=308.24s)]
*  We are looking at those options. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=309.8s)]
*  And ultimately, it's about serving the American people and getting President Trump's message [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=311.64s)]
*  across to them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=314.92s)]
*  I would offer these these this unsolicited advice. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  You might want to say we're not prepared to go there today, but I will get back to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=321.68s)]
*  you and feel free to use that line as often as you want. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  If if they're pushing hard on a topic that you're not ready to talk about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=329.56s)]
*  Caroline, congratulations. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=333.48s)]
*  You're making history and I'm sure it's going to be a great ride for you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXCRqjs7qyQ&t=335.24s)]
