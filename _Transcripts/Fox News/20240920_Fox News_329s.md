# Ron DeSantis: We want to get to the truth
**Fox News:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0)
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is with us, launching a state probe that—to the attempted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=0.0s)]
*  assassination of President Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=6.16s)]
*  Governor, great to have you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=8.16s)]
*  So we know the Department of Justice has been weaponized. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=10.4s)]
*  I don't think anybody really disputes that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=13.44s)]
*  Even most legal scholars see that for what it is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump in the end is going to be successful in that effort. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=20.28s)]
*  With that said, you don't have confidence in the federal government and the weaponized [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=23.76s)]
*  DOJ and their ability to do the job. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=29.8s)]
*  Tell us why. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=31.76s)]
*  Well, first, Sean, we have violations of Florida law, attempted murder. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  There are also a number of potential violations across multiple jurisdictions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  Just as a matter of course, Florida is serious about upholding its laws. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=44.44s)]
*  When people break them, they face the music. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=49.08s)]
*  That's just the way we do it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=51.56s)]
*  Then you also have this other question, in addition to making sure you throw the book [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=53.32s)]
*  at the suspect and that he serves in jail for the rest of his life, which is the appropriate [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=57.92s)]
*  punishment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=62.96s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=64.44s)]
*  Where did this guy come from? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=66.16s)]
*  How did he end up in the state of Florida? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=67.16s)]
*  How did he end up burrowed in those bushes in a part of that golf course perimeter, which [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=68.92s)]
*  is the most vulnerable location? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=74.48s)]
*  When you're playing that course—and I've played the course with—when Donald Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=77.72s)]
*  was president, so when security was at its height, I played that course. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=81.76s)]
*  You have the fifth hole, sixth hole, seventh tee box. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=86.0s)]
*  That's all right on the tree line that is right in front of a road. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  And that would be the place that people would do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=94.48s)]
*  And yet this guy was able to burrow in there for 12 hours and almost get off a shot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  And hats off to the Secret Service agent that engaged him before he was able to do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  But he was in a place where he shouldn't have been. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=107.84s)]
*  So I think that there's a lot of questions about that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=111.36s)]
*  And the state of Florida, that was not our responsibility. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=113.64s)]
*  That was obviously the Secret Service's responsibility. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=117.08s)]
*  So we don't have any agencies that are going to try to pass the buck or anything. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=120.08s)]
*  We just want to get to the truth, and we want people to know the facts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=123.58s)]
*  The agents around the president were heroic, amazing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=128.04s)]
*  I don't have enough positive adjectives to say about them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=131.32s)]
*  Sheriff's Department, you know, under your jurisdiction, they were amazing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=134.72s)]
*  They were amazing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=140.32s)]
*  Where the screw-up came is you have the most vulnerable area of that golf course, that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=142.44s)]
*  treat area around the holes you mentioned. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  And this is the area that is well known to be vulnerable, because that's where paparazzi [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=151.6s)]
*  will hide to get videos or pictures of the president playing golf. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=156.8s)]
*  And why they did not sweep that treat area is inexplicable to me, and in many ways unforgivable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=161.08s)]
*  It allowed a guy with an AK-47 with a scope on it to get, you know, 300-plus yards from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=168.68s)]
*  the president, probably closer by the time he took the shot. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=175.28s)]
*  And it was after Butler, where somebody got on a roof 130 yards from the president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, anyone with marginal shooting skill, that's the equivalent of a tap-and-putt, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=184.68s)]
*  governor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=189.12s)]
*  Yeah, no question about it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=192.12s)]
*  I mean, clearly, Butler, that roof was a prime location for somebody that wanted to pull [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=194.36s)]
*  off an attack, and they left it vacant. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=199.36s)]
*  And we know what happened as a result of that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=203.12s)]
*  And then on the golf course, I remember the security when Donald Trump was president was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=206.68s)]
*  obviously very significant. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  And when you're playing on that course, there's dogs sniffing, holes ahead, behind, you name [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=220.0s)]
*  It's a massive undertaking. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=221.0s)]
*  And when you're doing that, I remember thinking, being on the fifth green or on playing the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  sixth hole, I'm like, man, you have all this security, but yet there's a very busy street, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=226.88s)]
*  literally like 10 yards behind you when you're there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=232.16s)]
*  I was like, that is something. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=235.36s)]
*  And I thought to myself at the time, I'm like, well, obviously, they probably have some people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  that are scoping out on that street and whatnot, because literally someone could just pull over [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=240.88s)]
*  their car, hop out, and then they're right there in the hedges. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=245.4s)]
*  So I remember thinking that back then when he had the full presidential armada of security. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  So in a situation like this, coming two months after Butler, man, that's got to be the place [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=254.64s)]
*  that you would think could potentially pose some risk. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=260.76s)]
*  And so, yeah, we need answers to that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=264.84s)]
*  We also need to know more about this guy, Ryan Routh. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's got a very eclectic background. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=269.36s)]
*  He's been in and out of trouble with the law. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=272.44s)]
*  Whose radar was he on? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=275.56s)]
*  Now, he's not a Florida resident. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a North Carolinian, but he ends up in the state of Florida. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=278.44s)]
*  So so our folks here deserve answers to these questions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=282.04s)]
*  And the American people writ large deserve answers to these questions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=285.0s)]
*  I am sorry, but not sweeping that area is unforgivable to me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=289.16s)]
*  And heads need to roll. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=293.52s)]
*  And then the Secret Service patting themselves on the back, the interim head and praising [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=295.2s)]
*  Mayorkas made me want to vomit. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=300.24s)]
*  I just find that on every level unacceptable. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=302.92s)]
*  However, I applaud everybody else in law enforcement. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=306.6s)]
*  They all did their job. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=310.04s)]
*  But this is a a security failure of, you know, just monumental proportions. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=311.48s)]
*  Governor, great to have you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HA7_m5fhU0&t=318.36s)]
