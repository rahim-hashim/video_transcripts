# Sean Hannity: You can't make this up
**Fox News:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y)
*  And welcome to Hannity. We start tonight with a Fox News alert. At this hour, we are monitoring [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  live pictures from the Biden White House, where your president Joe is hosting an official [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=5.08s)]
*  state dinner for the prime minister of Japan. Take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=10.06s)]
*  Both the prime minister and I came of age as our countries were, as they came together. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=14.02s)]
*  We both remember the choices that were made to forge a friendship that were once only [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=20.02s)]
*  a devastating fight that existed before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=24.86s)]
*  Not exactly awe-inspiring, is it? Going back to World War II, it sounds like. Anyway, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=29.98s)]
*  to say the least. Now, this caps what has been a very, very unusually long day for your [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=34.14s)]
*  president. It is extremely rare to see Biden after 5 p.m. And as you know, he typically [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=39.58s)]
*  goes to bed early and wakes up late. But Joe is giving it his all for Japan's prime minister, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  who traveled over 6,000 miles to see him. In fact, Joe appeared in public multiple times [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=51.18s)]
*  today, but not without a lot of help. A lot of help. There were people telling him where [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=57.5s)]
*  to walk, what to say. And of course, Joe didn't go anywhere without his trusty giant cheat [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=61.86s)]
*  sheets first inside the White House during a few brief remarks with his Japanese counterpart. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=67.42s)]
*  Biden read directly from a no card. Of course, we can't even say hello. Say hello without [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=73.66s)]
*  a no card. Take a look. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=79.1s)]
*  Well, Fu Meir, welcome back to the White House. Welcome back to the Oval Office. It's good [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=80.9s)]
*  to have you here. Good to see you again. When we were here last year, we said the role [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=85.1s)]
*  being played by the United States and Japan is becoming even greater. And we I couldn't [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=89.66s)]
*  agree more with your assertion back then. And what we see in our joint support for Ukraine [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=96.66s)]
*  from the face of Russia's vicious assault was just outrageous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=103.66s)]
*  My name is Joe. Welcome to the White House. Anyway, a few hours later, during a short [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=111.06s)]
*  scripted press conference in the Rose Garden, Biden once again read directly from his trusty [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=117.78s)]
*  no cards. He also followed his usual practice of calling on a prearranged group of reporters [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=122.98s)]
*  listed on the no card. Now, this gets very interesting. Then Biden read prewritten answers [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=130.06s)]
*  from the same no card. The fake news journalists and the media mob, what, they're okay with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  this? Are they just going to pretend this is normal? You know, fake Jake, liberal Joe, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=141.7s)]
*  do you still claim that you're journalists? Take a close look at your screen. You can [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=146.82s)]
*  literally look at this. You can literally see the script in the in the reflection of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=151.42s)]
*  his giant sunglasses. You can't make this up. Anyway, did Joe have the answer to a question [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=158.42s)]
*  that he already knew would be asked? Because it certainly looks that way. Now today, virtually [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=164.92s)]
*  everything was scripted by Joe's White House staffers. The president merely just showed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  up, tried his best to read verbatim from another no card. Well, let's take one more look. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  We had a long discussion last, I guess almost two weeks ago now, and the best way to reduce [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=181.72s)]
*  the chances of miscalculation, misunderstanding. That's number one. Number two, in our alliance [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  we have with Japan is a purely defensive in nature. Third, next question. Who I call [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=194.08s)]
*  on next? Hang on a second. I got my list here. Hang on. I apologize. A really of AFP and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  thus far, and we and it's tied to the hostages. There are a number of hostages that are being [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=212.0s)]
*  held by Hamas. And just yesterday we're meeting with the vice president, our national security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=217.52s)]
*  advisor before that and then our American hostages as well. My name is Joe. Say hi to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=226.52s)]
*  guests. Hi, guests. It's clear Biden is just not capable of taking unscripted questions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=234.08s)]
*  He's not able to communicate extemporaneously. I'd love for him to host my radio show with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  750 stations. It's all extemporaneous for three hours, just one day. That would be entertaining. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=247.12s)]
*  Anyway, even with the huge amount of help from his large staff, Joe struggles in a massive [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  way as per usual. That's predictable. Take a look. Prime Minister is going to travel [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=259.16s)]
*  to North Carolina tomorrow to visit that project. Don't stay. Don't stay. You need to be back [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=265.0s)]
*  in Japan. They'll probably try to keep you. Our commitment to the defense of Japan under [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=271.0s)]
*  Article five, including the Seno... Senkaku Islands is unwavering. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  Why didn't everybody holler at once? Elect me. I'm in the 20th century, 21st century, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  back then. What happens when China reunites, as they call it, or has reunification with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=299.64s)]
*  Taiwan? Anyway, every day a struggle for your president, especially on those rare occasions [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=307.0s)]
*  when the president is forced to work for more than a few minutes. Now, in contrast, President [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=312.96s)]
*  Trump is constantly working, communicating with the American people. And today he was [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  in the great state of Georgia in Atlanta, where he answered a ton of questions on a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=323.12s)]
*  variety of topics during an impromptu press conference. He then visited a local Chick-fil-A, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=328.24s)]
*  where he was warmly greeted by the staff and customers and this very enthusiastic supporter [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=334.36s)]
*  and pro-Trump organizer. Oh, and he also gave away free shakes to people that were there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=340.2s)]
*  Take a look. I don't care what the media tells you, Mr. Trump. We support you. We support [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  you. Let me give you a hug. All while Joe Biden is scared to leave his bedroom without [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=352.84s)]
*  a giant cheat sheet telling him where to stand, what to say, who to answer questions, what [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=362.88s)]
*  to do when it's time to say goodbye. Well, from President Trump, he's having real conversations [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  with Americans every day. Unlike Biden, Trump is not afraid to answer tough questions. That's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=374.12s)]
*  because Trump's policies, they actually worked and he's not a cognitive mess. But in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=379.72s)]
*  last three years, the current administration's policies, they have frankly, well, pretty [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=384.64s)]
*  much wrecked the country from border to border. Joe cannot run on his record because everything [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=389.44s)]
*  is gone, well, catastrophically wrong and continues to get worse. For example, today [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=394.2s)]
*  we found out that inflation is again going in the wrong direction. Guess what? It wasn't [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  transitory after all. Another lie. Meanwhile, the broad tensions between Israel and Iran [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=406.6s)]
*  are now escalating. This comes just a few short days after Joe abandoned Israel, put [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  a knife in their back just to appease the radical base. That is now the modern Democratic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=419.56s)]
*  Party. That is their party, which at the end of the day is now helping the terrorist group [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=426.16s)]
*  Hamas that literally attacked Israel not lose the war that they started. His radical base [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=432.18s)]
*  insisting that Biden leave our closest ally hanging out to dry as they battle Hamas terrorists [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  in what is a literal war for Israel's survival. And there are Americans still held hostage. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  Nobody seems to talk about them. Needless to say, Biden cannot run on his record. He [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  can't ask the question, are you better off than you were four years ago? Can't run on [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  his intellect. Certainly his personality is not that warm and charming. It's a little [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=462.94s)]
*  creepy at times. Joe and his fellow Democrats have resorted to pretty wild scare tactics. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=467.74s)]
*  For example, I have a few of them. Biden recently tweeted, quote, Trump doesn't trust women [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=474.7s)]
*  and that he, quote, despises Latinos and that he's trying to rip away health care from Americans [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=479.86s)]
*  and kill millions of Americans. Stop right there. He's trying to kill you. That's what [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=486.86s)]
*  Joe Biden is running on. Biden also accused Trump and MAGA of trying to take away our [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=493.1s)]
*  freedoms. He also accused Trump of, quote, exploding the national debt, threatening to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=500.1s)]
*  cut Social Security and Medicare and passing a national ban on a woman's right to choose. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=505.3s)]
*  None of this is even remotely true. Joe is lying, but that's all he has and it gets worse. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=511.74s)]
*  Take a look. My predecessor and his MAGA friends wanted, I love the phrase, the language they [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=519.54s)]
*  use, they want to terminate the Infertile Care Act. Terminate. Well, guess what? Killing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=526.1s)]
*  millions of Americans, take them off of health care. Take a look at the things that they're [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=535.46s)]
*  rolling back. Remember I said ages ago, you know, in their minds, they want to bring slavery back. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=540.54s)]
*  Donald Trump talk uses phrases like, you're going to use eviscerate the Constitution. He's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=547.62s)]
*  going to be a dictator on day one. If it's a Trump reelection, Zelensky has legitimate reason [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  to be concerned. My sense is Donald Trump would hand the keys over to Putin. Why fight when you [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=559.38s)]
*  can just get the keys from a new American president? Recent reports that if reelected Trump will seek [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  to retaliate against his political opponents as well. Donald Trump will sign a national abortion [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=569.3s)]
*  ban into law if he is elected president and Republicans control the Congress. You build on [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=575.3399999999999s)]
*  infrastructure on bringing high tech manufacturing back to the United States on a clean energy [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=580.66s)]
*  revolution. That'll all stop if Donald Trump gets reelected as president. Do you believe that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=585.3s)]
*  Donald Trump were elected next year that he would try to stay in office beyond a second term? He [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=589.5s)]
*  would never leave office? There's no question. You think he would try to stay in power forever? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=595.5s)]
*  Absolutely. Anyway, kill Americans, bring slavery back. He's going to be a dictator. He's saying it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=600.14s)]
*  He said it on this show. Yeah, I'll be a dictator for one day on the border and bringing oil [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=609.46s)]
*  production back. That's all he said. After more than three years in office, Biden has nothing to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=614.94s)]
*  show. Other than a burning hatred for Donald Trump, now desperate will say he's trying to kill you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=620.38s)]
*  What happened to keep your doctor? Keep your plan. Save $2,500 per family per year. Obamacare, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=627.42s)]
*  the promise. Millions of you lost your plan, lost your doctor. You're paying 250% more and nearly [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=633.14s)]
*  half the country has one Obamacare exchange option. How's that working for you? And the people on the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=639.7s)]
*  left are so desperate, attacking Trump now for an Arizona Supreme Court ruling that upholds what is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=645.38s)]
*  a Civil War era law banning abortion. This will be fixed in the next week or two. Let not your heart [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=652.58s)]
*  be troubled. I can, I can pretty much assure that that will happen. Trump opposes the law, end this [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=659.54s)]
*  ruling, or you can believe Joe's make pretend Donald Trump that doesn't exist. And you know what? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=665.86s)]
*  Arizona's governor is a Democrat. The state's attorney general is a Democrat. The state legislature [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzlIYTXr7Y&t=671.94s)]
