# Peter Doocy: Sources share there is no plan for Biden to drop out
**Fox News:** [June 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c)
*  We're here now with more Fox News White House senior correspondent Peter Ducey is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ducey sir, you know, you've taken a lot of heat in that press room often. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  You've been you've been willing to go there and ask questions about this sensitive topic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=11.28s)]
*  How have you been treated? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=17.44s)]
*  Well, look, we have seen instances where the president has misspoken, including over the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=19.28s)]
*  last couple months when he was at a campaign fundraiser away from cameras and he was dropping [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=26.32s)]
*  the names of European leaders who have long been dead as people that he talked to as president. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=31.28s)]
*  And when I asked about that in here, I was told it is a conspiracy theory that continued, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=37.84s)]
*  especially over the last few weeks, when we were told by officials, White House officials in this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  room that any clip that appears to show President Biden having lost a step or freezing or saying [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=48.64s)]
*  the wrong thing is a cheap fake. But the solution would be for anybody curious about him who wants [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=55.12s)]
*  to form an opinion about the president just to watch an unedited Biden event. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=61.68s)]
*  Well, a lot of people don't tune in until there is something like a presidential [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  debate and they got to see a full unedited event. It is completely unclear that their opinions were [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  changed the way that the White House wanted them to be. And when you look today, the day after [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=78.64s)]
*  the debate where there were a lot of awkward silences while the president was speaking [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=84.56s)]
*  haltingly at times, he and his campaign are the ones who asked for no studio audience. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Today, it looked like he was feeding off the crowd or at the very least, if there's a pause, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=97.2s)]
*  the crowd is filling in the silence with cheers or with a four more years chant or something. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=102.56s)]
*  They are the ones who set the ground rules for last night. And you'll look everywhere. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=109.12s)]
*  I've spent the whole day in the White House booth looking for Democrats to say [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  or explain why they think maybe he had a good night last night and you can't find it. I spent [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  all day and then once Barack Obama describes it as a bad debate night, it's kind of over. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Nobody is going to go over Barack Obama's head and say, oh, no, he's wrong. Barack Obama is wrong, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=131.44s)]
*  the leader of the party. Here's why he's wrong. It's just not going to happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=138.64s)]
*  You know, the thing is, when they brought up the whole cheap fake video thing, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  it was amazing because we went back and we were very careful. I often reach out to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  the White House and with Corrine Jean-Pierre in her office and we try to get comment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=155.12s)]
*  I don't know, is it something that maybe I said or maybe I did, Peter, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=160.4s)]
*  because they never get back to us ever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Sure. That I don't know. But what I can tell you is there is no plan. We talked to campaign people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=167.76s)]
*  There is no plan for President Biden to drop out. I know that last night, Democrats in particular [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  were hysterical about their election chances, tanking. No plan for him to drop out. And they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=183.92s)]
*  say despite how things went last night, nobody that helped with the seven days of debate prep [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=189.28s)]
*  is going to get fired. And they say that President Biden will show up in September to debate Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=195.04s)]
*  again. Peter Ducey, thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSz2rBFZz7c&t=202.16s)]
