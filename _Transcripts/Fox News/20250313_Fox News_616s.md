# Sean Hannity: The old Democratic Party is dead, this is a radicalized party
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we are inching closer and closer to peace in Europe as President Trump now [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=2.44s)]
*  attempts a heavy lift. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=6.8s)]
*  And that would be a historic deal to end the death, the destruction that has been taking [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=8.68s)]
*  place in this war with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=14.02s)]
*  And here at home, in spite of all the media hype and hysteria and screaming and yelling [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=16.84s)]
*  and ranting and raving, we have a lot of great news on the economy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Prices are coming down nationwide and American manufacturing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=26.12s)]
*  It's making a massive comeback. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  And in about 24 hours, two American astronauts who are stranded in space by Joe Biden and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=31.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris will hopefully, we pray, hitch a ride back to Earth with Elon Musk and SpaceX. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=38.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats can't seem to do anything or help anyone. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=45.08s)]
*  In fact, they can't even help themselves. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=48.16s)]
*  Tomorrow at midnight, Senate Democrats, well, as of a day and a half ago, a promise to shut [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=50.56s)]
*  down the federal government. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=56.82s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer, our old friend himself, is the latest victim of the power of President [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=58.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Also, a lot of credit to the majority leader, John Thune, who has steadfastly called his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=64.12s)]
*  bluff and challenged him and outmaneuvered him ever since he took charge. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=69.2s)]
*  But there are now signs that the Schumer shutdown is falling apart and Schumer's about to cave [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  himself. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  While it is not totally clear how the Democrats will vote, well, heâ€”we appear to be headed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  towards another massive Trump win and another humiliation for the dying-on-the-vine Democratic [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=84.88s)]
*  Party. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=90.96s)]
*  Yesterday, Schumer publicly announcing that he would block the Republicans' funding bill, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=91.96s)]
*  he would shut down the government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=96.24s)]
*  But today, during a closed-door meeting, Schumer reportedly told his colleagues that he would [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  now vote to advance the Republicans' spending plan after reports of a lot of screaming and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=102.72s)]
*  yelling and infighting all behind closed doors. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=108.64s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, that screaming was so loud, it was heard on floors beneath where [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=112.6s)]
*  that meeting was taking place. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=118.44s)]
*  Senate Democrats, they became emotional, they became unhinged, this time against each other. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=120.44s)]
*  They are now facing a catch-22. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=125.88s)]
*  On the one hand, they want to sow as much chaos and hatred under Donald Trump as humanly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=127.56s)]
*  possible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=132.04s)]
*  They want to make life painful for everyone in America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=133.04s)]
*  They are basically cheering for America to fail. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, they worship the federal government, and they spent the last decade [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  vilifying government shutdowns as evil and horrible and cruel and terrible and mean. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=143.76s)]
*  In fact, this is what Chuck Schumer himself thought about government shutdowns until very [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=149.04s)]
*  recently when he supported this one yesterday, but seems to be flipping and flopping today [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=153.52s)]
*  because of Donald Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=159.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=160.36s)]
*  Spare innocent, hardworking Americans the pain of an unnecessary Trump shutdown. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=161.72000000000003s)]
*  So mean-spirited. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  It ought to end, and it ought to end now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  The American people don't want a shutdown. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  The last thing Americans need right now is a pointless government shutdown. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=174.08s)]
*  A shutdown would be a terrible outcome for the country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=178.8s)]
*  We shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=182.36s)]
*  End the shutdown. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  The shutdown is hurting millions of Americans. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=187.68s)]
*  It's going to get worse all because of President Trump's temper tantrum. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=190.96s)]
*  All right, over the years, during even the smallest threat of a possible partial shutdown, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Democrats say became unhinged, hysterical, accusing their Republican colleagues of holding [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=203.84s)]
*  the government hostage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=207.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's a reminder. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  This unnecessary shutdown that makes our country less safe, less secure, that's hurting hundreds [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  of thousands of families, hurting thousands of small businesses, hurting the state of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=216.68s)]
*  New Jersey and every state in this nation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=220.84s)]
*  We are facing a government shutdown that is totally unnecessary. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=222.72s)]
*  It's service members who are going to go out without paychecks who are going to suffer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=226.32s)]
*  It's federal firefighters who are going to suffer. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=230.52s)]
*  It's travelers at airports who are going to suffer. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=232.96s)]
*  It's parents with kids in Head Start who are going to lose child care that are going to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=235.44s)]
*  suffer. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=239.56s)]
*  And this senseless, senseless shutdown. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=240.56s)]
*  The American people are tired of our country being held hostage and our economy threatened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=244.2s)]
*  For the last 35 days, 800,000 federal workers have been held hostage through no fault of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=250.04s)]
*  their own. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=259.84s)]
*  The truth is that shutting down the government is a serious and dangerous action that we [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=260.84s)]
*  must do everything possible to prevent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  We have more tape of Chuckie Schumer apparently losing it on MSDNC coming up in a minute. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=272.76s)]
*  Even today, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar spoke out about the horrors of a government [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=277.64s)]
*  shutdown. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=282.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=283.52s)]
*  If there is a shutdown, what do you think that would mean for farmers, for ranchers, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=284.52s)]
*  for consumers? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=288.92s)]
*  Well, none of this is good for farmers and ranchers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=289.92s)]
*  And the last thing that I want to see is a shutdown. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=293.76s)]
*  It's the last thing she wants to see. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=296.88s)]
*  And yet Klobuchar was apparently ready, willing and able to shut the government down because [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=299.36s)]
*  she hates Donald Trump, of course, and because radicals who run her party think Donald Trump [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=304.68s)]
*  is evil and therefore they must stand against evil, don't they? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=309.38s)]
*  Naturally, Democrats oppose everything that Trump supports. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  President Trump wants to fund the government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=316.6s)]
*  Democrats want to shut it down. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=318.92s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=320.2s)]
*  President Trump wants peace in Europe and the Middle East. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Democrats have now become the pro long protracted war party funded by the American people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=324.16s)]
*  President Trump wants to protect women's sports. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=330.44s)]
*  Democrats are against it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=333.24s)]
*  President Trump wants to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars spent abroad on their radical agenda. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  Democrats throw a fit, say we're in a constitutional crisis, start setting Teslas on fire and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  charging stations on fire and threatening Elon Musk's life. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  Or Trump even, you know, does anything. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=353.76s)]
*  Even Chuck Schumer demanded waste, fraud and abuse at one point be cut out of our federal government. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=356.4s)]
*  Now, let's see, Clinton said it, Gore said it, Obama said it, and believe it or not, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=361.36s)]
*  even Chuck Schumer now used to support what Donald Trump is now doing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=366.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=371.64s)]
*  If we're going to eliminate the waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, it does mean we're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=373.28s)]
*  going to cut some of that out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=378.32s)]
*  And when I hear my friend Dave Camp say you cannot cut money out of Medicare, well, we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=380.4s)]
*  don't want to cut the good stuff that you point out or prevent add the prevention. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  But if we're going to, if one third, if what Senator Colburn says, that one third of Medicare [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=391.32s)]
*  doesn't go to patient care, you can't just get up there and say we don't want to cut [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  anything out of Medicare. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=401.88s)]
*  We want to cut the bad stuff and keep the good stuff. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=403.0s)]
*  And I think that's where we can find common ground. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=405.82s)]
*  He sounds like Elon Musk. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=409.8s)]
*  You better be careful. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=411.4s)]
*  They're going to be threatening him next. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=412.4s)]
*  Anyway, now Democrats put the rights of illegals above the safety of you, the American people. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  Sadly, what's happened is the Democratic Party is now ruled by radicals. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=418.96s)]
*  Chuck must bow before them if he wants to stay in power and people that suffer from [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  a terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=428.2s)]
*  And there is no space for logic, common sense. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=431.4s)]
*  The old Democratic Party is dead. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  This is a radicalized party through and through. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=436.32s)]
*  Trump hatred and rage. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=439.28s)]
*  Well, that kind of rules the day. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=441.08s)]
*  And there's a little bit of soleness, soullessness as well. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=443.11999999999995s)]
*  If you can't stand for the mothers who lost their children or women that lost their hero [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  law enforcement husbands or even a little young, a young man who was 12 years old to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=452.41999999999996s)]
*  be cancer, the performative chaos, the bingo card seem to be the only things that matter. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=463.84s)]
*  So if the government shuts down, then one of my questions is, are they allowed to still [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=465.32s)]
*  fire people? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=470.96s)]
*  In my opinion, if we're shut down, you can't be fired. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=471.96s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=476.4s)]
*  It does mean that people will not be paid, but it does mean that they will get their [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=477.4s)]
*  back pay. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=481.84s)]
*  We have the power to stand up for people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=482.84s)]
*  That is what the House did under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=484.5s)]
*  We gave an almost unanimous vote against this legislation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  That is what the Senate needs to do. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=492.32s)]
*  And they need to do it right now on this motion to proceed or the cloture vote, because that's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=494.08s)]
*  the vote that requires 60 votes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=500.4s)]
*  That's the place that Democrats have leverage. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=503.12s)]
*  As bad as all that is, Congressman Maxine Waters took it a step further and all but [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=507.0s)]
*  predicted a looming civil war in the country. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=511.6s)]
*  OK, take a look. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm worried that Trump is on the edge of creating a civil war. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=518.22s)]
*  He alluded to it more than once. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=523.88s)]
*  What does Trump expect? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=526.76s)]
*  Oh, I believe he expects violence. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=528.02s)]
*  I believe he expects confrontation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=530.82s)]
*  I believe he's working toward a civil war. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=533.5s)]
*  We're not going to get goaded. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=536.58s)]
*  We're not going to get tricked into that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=538.82s)]
*  Isn't this the woman that said get in their face, follow them into their stores at the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=541.5s)]
*  gas station, wherever you go, follow them? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=546.94s)]
*  Yeah, that was her. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=549.62s)]
*  Anyway, it's almost as if the Democrats were champions of democracy until Donald Trump [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=550.98s)]
*  won. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=555.38s)]
*  And now they are ready for a little bloodshed, maybe a little violence, burned out Teslas, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=556.38s)]
*  bullets fired into Tesla dealerships, 2020 style riots in the street. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=560.94s)]
*  Let's see, two dozen Americans dead, thousands of injured cops, billions in property damage. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=565.46s)]
*  And Kamala, the person they voted for, said they're not going to stop, shouldn't stop, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=570.38s)]
*  and we're not going to stop supporting them. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=573.7s)]
*  Disruptive riots that took place inside Trump Tower earlier today. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=575.9s)]
*  We're going to have more with Harris Faulkner, who is covering this today. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=580.46s)]
*  But an important reminder, the Democratic Party abides by only one value, and it's not [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=584.42s)]
*  democracy or freedom or government competence or even climate change. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=589.46s)]
*  What they really are about is power. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=594.26s)]
*  They only care about power. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=596.22s)]
*  And they will do and they will say anything to hold on to power and relevance in perpetuity. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2h1OArYpz8&t=598.38s)]
