# RFK, Jr. speaks out after shots fired at Trump: 'End the vitriol'
**Fox News:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg)
*  All right, joining us now, 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, great to have you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=6.4s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=8.96s)]
*  You know, I know we have our political differences, and that's fine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=9.96s)]
*  That's not what tonight is all about. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=14.44s)]
*  There came a moment whereâ€”there were a couple of moments where you had requested Secret [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=17.0s)]
*  Service protection, and you are a legitimate presidential candidate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=23.36s)]
*  Sir, I went to bat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=27.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure you're aware, I was pretty outspoken about this, when you had requested [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=28.96s)]
*  that protection. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  You lost your father, you lost your uncle to assassination. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=35.46s)]
*  And I was shocked that they did not give that to you, and I said, you deserve that at the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=41.56s)]
*  time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  And I believe that today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=49.24s)]
*  And I hope they reexamine that question tonight, first thing in the morning, and you get the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=50.7s)]
*  proper protection that you need. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=55.92s)]
*  You've got to protect every presidential candidate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=57.64s)]
*  But you know, coming from your family and your background and your personal experience, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=60.36s)]
*  what was your reaction to today? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=65.04s)]
*  Well, you know, my reaction is I hope, Sean, that Americans can kind of take a step back [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=67.04s)]
*  and take a breath and say, it's time to end the vitriol. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=76.56s)]
*  You were talking about, and Laura was talking about, just the anger from both sides, and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=81.92s)]
*  from the media, and people pointing to other political candidates and saying they're going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=90.6s)]
*  to be the end of the republic, they're going to be the end of democracy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=96.16s)]
*  And that kind of poison feeds into this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=100.08s)]
*  You know, when my uncle was killed, I was 10 years old. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  And the morning that he landed in Dallas, there were posters all over Dallas and a front [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=107.4s)]
*  page of a newspaper which had his picture on it saying, one, dead or alive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  And that was the gestalt of that time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  It was driven by anger. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  And in many ways, his murder was a product of that anger. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  When my father was killed, it was the same time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=130.16s)]
*  It was the most divisive time in American history. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=132.12s)]
*  It was very much like today, most divisive since the Civil War. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=135.84s)]
*  There were riots in over 100 cities that summer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=140.72s)]
*  Martin Luther King was killed two months before my father. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  People were being shot on college campuses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=150.12s)]
*  And that anger laid the foundation for my father's murder. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  After President Kennedy's murder, there was a time of regrouping and there was a time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=162.36s)]
*  of where Americans said to each other, we have to stop this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=167.24s)]
*  We have to start looking at each other as part of a big family. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  We can have differences with each other without despising each other. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=175.68s)]
*  We are the exemplary democracy of the world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=179.72s)]
*  We can't allow our country to devolve into violence. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  We are better than that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=186.52s)]
*  And everybody on both sides. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=187.96s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the other media, but also you and me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=190.12s)]
*  And all of us are complicit in some ways in what happened tonight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=195.88s)]
*  And I think all of us have to sort of step back now and say, how do we change the tone [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=200.72s)]
*  of this whole campaign? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=207.76s)]
*  How do we change the tone of the political dialogue in this country and start to forgive [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=210.08s)]
*  each other, to reconcile, to love each other again, and to see each other, to be able to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  have differences with each other without wanting to murder each other? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=219.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, let's go back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  How old were you when your father was assassinated? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=229.16s)]
*  How old were you when your uncle was assassinated? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=232.32s)]
*  I was 10 years old when my uncle was assassinated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=237.6s)]
*  And, you know, I remember it like it was yesterday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=240.6s)]
*  I was with his body in the Catholic and the East Room of the White House. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=245.4s)]
*  I was in the funeral procession. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=253.0s)]
*  I remember every moment of it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=256.6s)]
*  I was 14 when my dad died. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=259.44s)]
*  And I was with him when he died in Los Angeles. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=262.96s)]
*  So I sent a message out, a note out to President Trump tonight and to his family telling him [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=266.16s)]
*  how relieved I am that he was not more badly injured, wishing him a quick recovery, thanking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=275.56s)]
*  him for his courage during that event, which was inspirational. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  But also telling him that Cheryl and I are praying for him, our whole family is praying [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=288.88s)]
*  for him, for Melania and for his family, not only for his quick recovery, but for his continued [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=294.0s)]
*  safety during this campaign. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=301.8s)]
*  And I really wish, I really hope that President Biden reaches out to President Trump and offers [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=303.64s)]
*  him a podium somewhere with two of these men and reassure the nation that they're both [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=311.84s)]
*  going to make an effort to change the tone of this campaign so that we all can inspire [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  us all to start being kind to each other. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=335.56s)]
*  I think that's what's going to take. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=337.8s)]
*  And, you know, after my uncle died, there was this moment of calm. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=338.96s)]
*  There was a moment of peacefulness that Congress got together, both sides, and passed the Civil [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=343.64s)]
*  Rights Act, guaranteeing the right to vote for black Americans. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=348.52s)]
*  And there was a healing that took place. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  And I hope the same thing happens now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=356.2s)]
*  I remember, too, I remember your father, I mean, it's a famous video of him announcing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  to a crowd that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  This is all happening in the same time period, as you know. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=371.56s)]
*  There are two things that I think, you know, that relate directly to you that have to happen [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=375.48s)]
*  as a result of what happened today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=380.52s)]
*  And one is, I think you need Secret Service protection immediately for you and your family [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=383.4s)]
*  as a presidential candidate, putting aside our personal political differences, number [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=388.64s)]
*  one. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=393.56s)]
*  Number two, you know, there's been a lot of talk for a lot of years about releasing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=394.56s)]
*  the files about your uncle's assassination. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=397.4s)]
*  And I don't know why there has been reluctance and resistance to do so. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=400.76s)]
*  I believe President Trump recently said that if elected, he would in fact release those. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=405.16s)]
*  I wonder why there's any argument as to why not. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=409.48s)]
*  Would you have a request in to President Biden? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=414.08s)]
*  Have they given you any legitimate reason why they keep refusing you the Secret Service [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=418.4s)]
*  protection that you have requested in light of what has happened to your family? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=423.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but I don'tâ€”and listen, Sean, I really appreciate you going to bat [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=427.48s)]
*  for me on that issue because you've done that before and you've done it pretty persistently [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=434.48s)]
*  despite our personal differences with each other. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=438.64s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of example that, you know, we all need to look at. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=441.2s)]
*  You don't like anything about my politics, but you have been asking for me to get protection. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=446.0s)]
*  I don't want to make thatâ€”I don't want to makeâ€”I don't want to make this evening [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=452.76s)]
*  about me. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=458.92s)]
*  It's about something bigger. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=459.92s)]
*  And, you know, you talked about the Secret Service in an admiring way. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  And I really like that you mentioned after these men and women, how they rushed into [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=466.08s)]
*  the gunfire, how they surrounded President Trump. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  They put their own bodies in the ways of those bullets. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=473.52s)]
*  They invited people who shoot at them rather than the president with an extraordinary [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  courage and with a commitment to our country, to our Constitution. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  They weren't just protecting a man. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  They were protecting our nation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=489.12s)]
*  And I think all of us have to step back and say, you know, we need to have a little bit [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  of that courage in our own lives now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  And it might be not running into a bullet, but maybe biting our tongue when we have a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=499.08s)]
*  really withering reply to gifts to somebody, maybe not amplifying an angry pose from somebody [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=504.4s)]
*  else, maybe doing something kind for somebody we don't like, somebody on the other side [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=510.96s)]
*  of the aisle, reaching out to doing something healing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=517.0s)]
*  And, you know, I hope you asked about the JFK files, you know, President Biden and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=520.76s)]
*  President Trump both promised to release them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  I know you have a very, very strong friendship with President Trump, but maybe at some time [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=533.36s)]
*  over dinner at late at night, you can ask him why he decided not to do that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  But I don't want to talk about those issues today. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HAedyPyvg&t=543.2s)]
