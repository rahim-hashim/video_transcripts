# Sean Hannity: This is a travesty of justice
**Fox News:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, Alvin Bragg's, while crowning political show trial is almost over, the closing [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  arguments are in the books. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=6.8s)]
*  And soon, 12 jurors selected from one of the most anti-Trump districts in the entire country, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=8.56s)]
*  they will decide the fate of Donald Trump pending appeal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=14.5s)]
*  Now, today, the prosecution asked jurors to throw caution to the wind, convict the former [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=17.6s)]
*  president of a crime that they were never able to explain, let alone prove it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=22.68s)]
*  In fact, Bragg wants the jury to hand down 34 felony convictions based on what we have [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=28.2s)]
*  been saying from the beginning, a novel legal theory surrounding a misdemeanor document [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=33.6s)]
*  labeling allegation well past the statute of limitations, upcharged to a felony because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=39.8s)]
*  of this mysterious election law violation that was never charged or prosecuted ever [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=46.32s)]
*  anywhere in America. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=52.84s)]
*  And this entire convoluted case relies on one witness, a convicted liar, admitted liar, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=54.56s)]
*  disbarred lawyer by the name of Michael Cohn. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=61.84s)]
*  Now, we have talked in detail about Bragg's ulterior motives and Cohn's utter lack of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  credibility. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=70.12s)]
*  We have talked about a judge that should have recused himself. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=71.28s)]
*  But tonight, another major story is emerging, and it surrounds the judge, and that's Juan [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=73.92s)]
*  Murchon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=79.72s)]
*  The Biden donating judge has now placed basically cinder blocks on the scales of justice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=81.12s)]
*  First, he attempted to silence Donald Trump with an unconstitutional gag order. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Next, he allowed the prosecution to run wild with speculation and insinuate the courtâ€”in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=91.52s)]
*  court that Trump was guilty of phantom election violations that were charged or that weren't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  even charged or prosecuted. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=104.0s)]
*  Murchon then allowed a shady cast of characters that the prosecution called to the stand to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=106.04s)]
*  say whatever. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=111.48s)]
*  Stormy Daniels could talk about ghosts and dead people, tell raunchy stories and bad [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=113.08s)]
*  jokes that were in no way relevant or material to the case. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=118.64s)]
*  The judge also allowed Michael Cohn to profit from his testimony, and apparently, according [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=123.12s)]
*  to the defense attorneys, lie on the stand repeatedly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=128.24s)]
*  According to our own Trey Gowdy, the defense gave up objecting because it was almost never [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=132.72s)]
*  sustained by the judge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=137.52s)]
*  But when it came to the defense, ah, well, Judge Murchon sustained almost every objection. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=139.32s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=145.32s)]
*  Hamstringing witnesses, yelling at Trump's lawyers, openly rebuking one witness in front [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=146.32s)]
*  of the jury. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Judge Murchon's disdain for all things Trump, it was palpable from beginning to end. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=153.36s)]
*  But his adherence to the law was nowhere to be found. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=158.56s)]
*  This is, by every measure, a travesty of justice perpetrated by Judge Juan Murchon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=162.36s)]
*  Make no mistakes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  There is no credible evidence in this case of any crime committed by Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=170.08s)]
*  The prosecution's star witness was not just a thief, but also an admitted convicted liar. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=176.08s)]
*  And as Trump's attorneys put it, Cohn is the MVP of liars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=182.46s)]
*  In closing arguments, they referred to Cohn as the gloat, the greatest liar of all time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=186.36s)]
*  He lied on his taxes, he lied to his bank, he lied to the Mueller investigation team, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=192.12s)]
*  he lied to a federal judge, he lied to Congress on multiple occasions, lied to his family, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=197.4s)]
*  and lied to the media. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=202.36s)]
*  And during this current trial, Cohn was accused of lying on the stand during multiple occasions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Keep in mind, a nondisclosure agreement, it is not a crime. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Paying a publication, working with a publication like the National Enquirer, what they call [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  catch and kill about a story, that is also not a crime. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=217.6s)]
*  The prosecution wants jurors to believe that the way those payments were labeled was incorrect [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  and illegal and some type of federal election fraud. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  These payments were to Trump's attorney, they were labeled a legal expense because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=232.56s)]
*  that's what they were. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, the burden of proof is supposed to be with the prosecution, and they have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=239.32s)]
*  proved nothing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=243.32s)]
*  And by the way, where is the evidence that Donald Trump, because intent matters here, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  where is the intention that he violated the law? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=249.16s)]
*  Where is the evidence that he committed an election violation? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=252.32s)]
*  Why should anyone believe that Michael Cohn is telling the truth this time? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  But of course, Judge Juan Mershon, well, he has done his best to basically tip the scales [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=260.44s)]
*  of justice with cinderblocks, constantly giving the prosecution whatever they want, while [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=265.68s)]
*  severely limiting the defense around every turn. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  This is not justice in America. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=274.68s)]
*  This is lawfare being waged by a Biden-loving prosecutor with the help of a Biden-donating [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=277.24s)]
*  judge to be decided by a jury from the borough of Manhattan in New York City, where Biden [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=283.28s)]
*  won just shy of 90 percent of the vote. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=289.84s)]
*  There's no crime, there's no evidence of a crime, there's no credibility in this case. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  But a jury might well vote to convict simply because Donald Trump is on trial with a judge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  that obviously wants him convicted. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=302.76s)]
*  What did I say from the beginning of this trial? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=305.48s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot get a fair trial in New York City, regardless of the outcome. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=307.64s)]
*  He did not get a fair trial in New York City. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=313.48s)]
*  And for the record, Mar-a-Lago is not worth only $18 million, much closer to a billion, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=316.2s)]
*  maybe more. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=322.6s)]
*  But according to the Biden White House, this is fair and equal justice. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=323.74s)]
*  It's not political. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  Today, while the Biden campaign, they decided to have a campaign photo op in front of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  courthouse. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=335.36s)]
*  Now, of course, Joe wasn't there in his place. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=336.36s)]
*  The campaign rolled out the 80-year-old Robert De Niro to rant and rave and hem and haw and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=339.16s)]
*  yell and pretend to be a tough guy like he was in Goodfellas. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=344.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=348.32s)]
*  This city is pretty accommodating. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=349.32s)]
*  We make room for clowns. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  We have them all over the city, people who do crazy things in the street. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=357.56s)]
*  We tolerate it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=361.12s)]
*  It's part of the city. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=362.12s)]
*  It's part of the culture. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=363.12s)]
*  But not a person like Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=364.92s)]
*  Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=368.16s)]
*  I don't mean to scare you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=374.28s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=375.56s)]
*  Maybe I do mean to scare you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=378.68s)]
*  for granted. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=384.18s)]
*  In elections, forget about it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=386.0s)]
*  That's over. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=388.2s)]
*  That's done. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=389.2s)]
*  If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=390.2s)]
*  Forget about it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=396.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=397.76s)]
*  Anyway, like Biden, De Niro's best years are behind him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=398.76s)]
*  Sadly, he suffers from one of the worst cases of Trump derangement syndrome we've ever [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=400.84s)]
*  seen, contrary to what you heard from De Niro, the greatest threat to our American Republic. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=404.88s)]
*  of ours, this constitutional republic is not from the guy facing real prison time because [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=412.08s)]
*  of this political show trial. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=417.28s)]
*  Instead, it would be the far-left prosecutors, the bureaucrats, who have turned your system [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  of justice into a tool for political retribution. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  Our constitutional republic, be damned. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=428.36s)]
*  Equal justice under the law, be damned. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=430.84s)]
*  Equal application of our laws, be damned. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=433.4s)]
*  Welcome to Joe Biden's America. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXEFeD75R4&t=435.88s)]
