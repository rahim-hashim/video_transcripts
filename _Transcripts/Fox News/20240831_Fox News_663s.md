# Byron Donalds: This is the beginning of the end of Kamala Harrisâ€™ campaign
**Fox News:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888)
*  Here now with more, Florida Congressman Byron Donnells, Fox and Friend Weekends co-host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=0.0s)]
*  Will Cain, and Fox News contributor Miranda Devine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  All right, I'll start with you, Congressman Donnells. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=8.08s)]
*  You know, James Cardwell was probably right when he said that Kamala Harris has to really [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=12.0s)]
*  answer for her left messaging and everything that she said. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=18.68s)]
*  And he basically said that preachy females were to blame for the messaging problem. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=23.56s)]
*  Has Kamala taken away those concerns that Cardwell had? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=30.0s)]
*  No, she hasn't, Judge. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=34.24s)]
*  If anything, looking at that first clip, she's only amplified them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=36.24s)]
*  They had the campaigns having staffers leak out to the press saying that she was changing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=40.68s)]
*  all these positions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=45.84s)]
*  Then when she's finally asked about it, after 40 days of having been able to sit in the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=46.84s)]
*  back and craft an answer, she comes out with that her values have not changed? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  This is not good for the Harris campaign, because number one, the imagery did not look [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=56.76s)]
*  good. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=61.36s)]
*  She did not look strong. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=62.36s)]
*  She did not look like the mantle of a president. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=63.36s)]
*  And then number two, she backtracks on all of the leaks that her campaign was using to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=65.64s)]
*  backtrack off of her radical, progressive, liberal agenda. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=71.16s)]
*  It did not go well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=75.4s)]
*  I'm assured, I'm pretty sure that the rest of this interview did not go well, but we'll [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=76.72s)]
*  see. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=81.64s)]
*  The bigger issue is Kamala Harris has hidden from the press because she cannot actually [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=82.64s)]
*  go toe-to-toe with reporters and the American people to question and go through her record. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=88.04s)]
*  It is a radical record. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=94.66s)]
*  It is a bad record for the American people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=96.18s)]
*  I think you're seeing the beginning of the end for this campaign. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=98.4s)]
*  And you know, Will Cain, the whole idea that she is a candidate for change, according to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=102.2s)]
*  is stunning to me, because there's no change. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=109.8s)]
*  She's been in the White House for three years and nine months. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=112.6s)]
*  What is wrong with these people? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=116.24s)]
*  There's a change in the vibes, Judge. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=119.72s)]
*  There's a change in the top of the totem pole. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=121.52s)]
*  There's a new totem. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=123.8s)]
*  But underneath that totem, for the rest of the totem pole, is the same policies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Like Newt Gingrich and the congressman, I actually find it very notable, important, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=129.26s)]
*  Judge, that she said her values have not changed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=133.24s)]
*  I think a very worthy follow-up would be, could you please explain? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=135.96s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=138.84s)]
*  Would you articulate your values? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=139.84s)]
*  Because we could explain, and we could show a montage right now, Judge, of her saying, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=141.84s)]
*  for example, that we need to fight for equity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=146.68s)]
*  When she explains equity, she says not everybody starts at the same place, but everybody should [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=149.4s)]
*  end up at the same place. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=153.52s)]
*  And in order to do so, some should get more than others. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, that might not be an exact repetition, but it's pretty rhythmic with the popular [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=158.24s)]
*  Marxist saying of, from each according to his ability to each according to his need. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=163.56s)]
*  It sounds to me like she is doubling down on values that are overtly Marxist. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=169.28s)]
*  They are overtly Marxist, Miranda Devine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=175.0s)]
*  I mean, when they talk about, and even Wall's brothers and sisters and, you know, the Marxism, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=177.4s)]
*  we look forward, we never look back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's almost like, you know, pre-World War II. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=185.44s)]
*  Yes, it is, Judge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=191.64s)]
*  And look, the entire way that they're running her campaign is very communistic. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  It's very top-down control and a lot of brainwashing and lying and pretending that there's joy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  out there, when really the news that's filtering through from Harris' campaign headquarters [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  is that it's just full of confusion. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  There's competing priorities. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  You have, you know, people from her old loyalists, from her disastrous 2019 campaign. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=217.08s)]
*  You've got the old Biden campaign loyalists who she kept on. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  And then you've got this new Obama team coming in, the old Obama 2012 crew like David Plouffe. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=228.28s)]
*  And they're not meshing together. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  They all have completely different priorities. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And the real problem is that you have a candidate who cannot make up her mind. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=239.24s)]
*  She is insecure and indecisive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=244.4s)]
*  And you know, it took her 40 days to figure out which sycophantic media outlet she was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=247.36s)]
*  going to give this pre-recorded 18-minute interview. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure it'll be her only one of the campaign. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=256.12s)]
*  And even then, she had to have her wingman, as you call him, emotional support partner, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Tim Walz, by her side. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=265.72s)]
*  And as Byron said, the optics were just shocking. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  She was dwarfed by them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=270.68s)]
*  I think she was looking for the CEO-in-command look, but it didn't work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=276.52s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=278.08s)]
*  And, Congressman Donalds, I'll go back to you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=279.08s)]
*  You know, it's not just the Obama campaign, the Biden campaign, the Harris campaign. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=281.12s)]
*  Or people, like 92 percent of the people who worked in her office left. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  But you've also got Mark Elias from the Steele dossier days. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  And you know, it's almost as though her campaign is reflecting, in terms of it being chaotic [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=297.04s)]
*  and disorderly, the candidate herself as a person who is not being asked follow-ups, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=302.84s)]
*  and is not clear on what she believes in. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=308.92s)]
*  Judge, what we are witnessing is what happens when you have a machine candidate, somebody [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=310.92s)]
*  that is picked by the Democratic machine. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=317.28s)]
*  Every aspect of that machine wants to have their hands in this campaign. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=319.92s)]
*  And to Miranda's point, it doesn't look like she has the confidence within herself [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=323.68s)]
*  or the ability to take charge and lead this campaign. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  If she can't do that, how's she going to lead the United States of America? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=333.28s)]
*  Contrast that with Donald J. Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=337.56s)]
*  Judge, I can assure you, he's in charge of that campaign. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=339.68s)]
*  Everybody has their job, but the buck stops with him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=343.64s)]
*  He makes the decisions, and they move forward. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=346.64s)]
*  That's why we were so successful as a country, because he is take charge, he is a leader. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=349.44s)]
*  This interview already is demonstrating that she is not. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=355.68s)]
*  I mean, Dana Bash might be five feet tall, and she looked bigger than Kamala Harris tonight. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=358.68s)]
*  Yeah, she looked much bigger. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=364.72s)]
*  And you know, Will, I'll go to you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=366.24s)]
*  I think there's something like 67 days. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=368.24s)]
*  Look at her, 40 days. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like she's in the desert for 40 days, wringing her hands, trying to figure out, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  oh, my gosh, who should I have do the interview? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=374.76s)]
*  And I'll bring my wingman with me, and there won't be enough time, and we can edit it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=377.12s)]
*  Nobody's talkingâ€”we haven't seen the edits yet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=381.6s)]
*  But is there enough time to overcome this joy and lunacy of a change? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=384.16s)]
*  So much pressure is going to come down to that debate, because I don't have much faith [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=394.8s)]
*  at all that the press will be able to pull her out of that manufactured, A.I. candidate [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=399.12s)]
*  stage-managed version of Kamala Harris. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=403.96s)]
*  The real version that we saw windows of, glimpses of for the last four years. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=406.44s)]
*  Somebody that does not think on their feet and does not have depth when it comes to the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=410.76s)]
*  issues. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  So if I can't count on the press to give us that authenticity, the only real opportunity [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  does come down to that debate for Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=419.58s)]
*  And hopefully we're not limited to one debate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  But that's the best chance to see the real Kamala. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, Miranda, you talked yesterday, you were speaking about Zuckerberg. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=428.4s)]
*  Zuckerberg has made the decision that he's not going to give $400 million in Zuckerbucks [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=434.08s)]
*  and, you know, he's not going to be subject to any kind of intimidation like the intimidation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=439.08s)]
*  from the Biden-Harris campaign. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=444.04s)]
*  What do you think that signals in terms of this election? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=446.16s)]
*  I think it shows that Zuckerberg is seeing what side of the road he needs to be on, and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=452.8s)]
*  he suspects that Donald Trump is going to win the next election. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=458.96s)]
*  And he knows that he's in bad odour with Donald Trump and his supporters because of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=463.16s)]
*  what he did to help rig the 2020 election. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=468.12s)]
*  So I think it's too little too late. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  He's very disingenuous. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=473.8s)]
*  But I guess it's a good sign. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  At least the powerful censor, you know, sensorial people from the 2020 election are losing power. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=476.88000000000005s)]
*  Because if you've got someone like Mark Zuckerberg joining forces with Elon Musk, or at least [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=488.24s)]
*  trying to get on that side of the post, you know that Donald Trump is ascendant. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, and Congressman, Donald's very quickly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, Kamala Harris right now is riding this joy balloon. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=500.9s)]
*  At some point, it's got to start leaking. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=506.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, there are leaks coming out of the campaign, but how long will she be [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=508.9s)]
*  able to withstand the kind of pressure that she's going to be under? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=513.66s)]
*  Not so much from the press, but in terms of the campaign itself? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=517.4s)]
*  Not much longer, because the demands and the expectations are only going to rise. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=522.3399999999999s)]
*  As we watch this full interview, if this thing doesn't go well, there's going to be calls [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=526.88s)]
*  for her to step out and do more. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=531.4799999999999s)]
*  The debate, all the pressures on Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump, we know who Donald Trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  is and what he's going to do. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  She has to demonstrate the stature, the competency and then the ideas to be president of the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=539.8599999999999s)]
*  United States. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=545.16s)]
*  So I think you're going to see more out of this campaign as things trend downwards for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  Quickly, Will Cain. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=551.22s)]
*  You know, it's kind of tight right now. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=552.82s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=555.22s)]
*  I can't explain the American public embracing Kamala Harris. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  I truly cannot. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=564.1s)]
*  I think that it is just thisâ€”I really cannot judge. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=565.64s)]
*  I don't understand how you could accept what is a D-level candidate as the potential [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=568.46s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=572.46s)]
*  But the answer will go back. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, it's going to go back to that clip you played of Ben Stiller. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be an American public that rides along the wave of the news, doesn't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  dig deep, doesn't care about understanding Kamala Harris, but just rides the vibes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and Miranda, do you think that in Pennsylvania, when she says, you knowâ€”you know, she hasn't [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=585.62s)]
*  talked about fracking. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=591.3s)]
*  She hasn't talked about explaining a way, unless, you know, it's in this 18-minute [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=592.54s)]
*  interview, like, why did you change your mind? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=597.9s)]
*  A map of your values are the same. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=600.42s)]
*  But your values are not the values of the people in Pennsylvania, a state that you need [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=602.4599999999999s)]
*  to win. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=606.5799999999999s)]
*  Does she just rely on the surrogates to say it, or will she just run an ad and say, you [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=607.74s)]
*  know, we need to frack in Pennsylvania? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=612.82s)]
*  Well, I don't think we can rely, as we've just been saying and Will just mentioned, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=617.6600000000001s)]
*  on the media to actually hold her feet to the fire. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  But I do have faith in the American people that if this is a fair vote, that they will [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=626.7s)]
*  see through Kamala Harris. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=633.38s)]
*  I think the fakery that is her intrinsic quality is going to be more and more evident, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=635.1s)]
*  just like it was in 2019 when everything fell apart. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=641.62s)]
*  All right, Congressman Donalds, Miranda Devine and Will Cain, good to see you all. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=645.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cae2aDLl888&t=650.1s)]
