# Marco Rubio: Only Trump can make this possible
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns)
*  Last night, President Trump said he had received some outreach from Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  Sounds like he's ready to get back to the negotiating table. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=4.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=7.96s)]
*  Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=8.96s)]
*  The letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=15.06s)]
*  to bring lasting peace closer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=20.56s)]
*  Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=23.32s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=26.8s)]
*  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=35.2s)]
*  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=42.72s)]
*  That is convenient for you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=49.44s)]
*  I appreciate that he sent this letter to Scott a little while ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=51.6s)]
*  This says President Trump has temporarily cut off military funding to and intelligence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=56.96s)]
*  sharing with Ukraine, but those moves could be reversed very soon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Here with the very latest, our Secretary of State Marco Rubio is with us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=65.64s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, good to have you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=70.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  You were in the room last Friday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  It was somewhat surreal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=75.8s)]
*  I said on Friday, and I think I've been proven correct, that he will be back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=77.92s)]
*  That letter and that post on X yesterday said everything that I think needed to be said [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=83.12s)]
*  to get this thing back on track. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=88.92s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the important thing to understand about last Friday is not last Friday, it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  everything that led up to it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=97.4s)]
*  It's been very clear from the beginning that President Trump views this as a protracted, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=98.44s)]
*  stalemated conflict, and frankly, it's a proxy war between nuclear powers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=102.04s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=107.2s)]
*  And it needs to come to an end. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=109.08s)]
*  And no one has any idea or any plan to bring it to an end. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=110.28s)]
*  The plan of the Ukrainians up to now and their allies on Capitol Hill and the people you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  talk to in other countries is let's just keep giving them as much as they need for as long [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=118.08s)]
*  as it takes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=121.68s)]
*  That's not a strategy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=122.68s)]
*  On the Russian side, obviously, they struggled early on in this conflict. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=123.68s)]
*  They're a bigger country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=126.44s)]
*  They've made some progress, but by no means are the Russians running away with it either. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=127.44s)]
*  So it's a stalemated conflict. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=131.44s)]
*  This was explained to everybody. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=133.24s)]
*  It was made very clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=134.28s)]
*  All the president's trying to do here is figure out is there's a path towards peace. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=136.28s)]
*  We have to engage both sides, the Russians and the Ukrainians, and we ask the Ukrainians [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  not to sabotage it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  When the vice president made the point that it's going to take diplomacy to get things [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=145.24s)]
*  like this solved, President Zelensky, unfortunately, made the decision to challenge the vice president [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=149.06s)]
*  and start questioning whether diplomacy is even possible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=153.72s)]
*  In essence, sabotaging and undermining the president's plan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  And so that led to the dust-up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm glad to see that there's been a reconsideration of that position because I truly believe that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=161.64s)]
*  this is a conflict that we need to find a way to end. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  And it's going to require concessions from both sides. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=169.2s)]
*  But we have to get them both to the table. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=171.8s)]
*  The Ukrainians have to be there, obviously. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=174.04s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=175.84s)]
*  The Russians have to be at that table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=176.84s)]
*  And only President Trump can make that possible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=178.76s)]
*  That's been the goal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=181.12s)]
*  That remains the goal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=182.12s)]
*  And that's what we're focused on now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=183.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=184.12s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=185.12s)]
*  It's been a stalemate, but it's been a stalemate of hundreds of billions of hard-earned taxpayer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=186.12s)]
*  dollars. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=190.0s)]
*  And it's not going to go on in perpetuity. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=191.56s)]
*  And it's—there won't be a country left. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=192.56s)]
*  And how many more people have to die? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=195.16s)]
*  How many people died from last Friday to today, for example? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=196.68s)]
*  So my understanding is Putin said he is willing to get into a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=200.28s)]
*  Is that your understanding? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=206.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=207.84s)]
*  Look, I mean, we met with him two weeks ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=208.84s)]
*  And the point of our meeting with him was very simple. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=211.88s)]
*  Are you interested in talking about ending this war or not? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=214.36s)]
*  Because there can't really be much of a change with our relationship as long as this war is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=217.16s)]
*  going on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Their answer was, we are interested in talking about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  We now need to follow up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=224.04s)]
*  It's hard to follow up when the other side of the conflict is saying they're not interested [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=225.6s)]
*  in peace at all. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=229.32s)]
*  And that was the message that was coming across. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=230.32s)]
*  Hopefully that's been corrected. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=232.44s)]
*  I hope that's going to be corrected more clearly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=233.48s)]
*  And then I think that opens the door to figure out whether this is possible. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=235.92s)]
*  By the way, this should be a mystery to no one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=239.76s)]
*  The president, when he was a candidate and he was running, he said very clearly this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=241.28s)]
*  is a war that never would have happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  And I believe that to be true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=246.16s)]
*  Had he been president and we need to bring it to an end, he's working to become, he wants [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=247.72s)]
*  to be a peacemaker. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=252.28s)]
*  Usually, and I made this point in multiple interviews, usually people are happy when [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=253.28s)]
*  our president, the president of the most powerful country in the world, is looking to prevent [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=257.56s)]
*  wars and to end wars. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=261.24s)]
*  Somehow when it's Donald Trump that's doing it, it's somehow a horrible thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=263.32s)]
*  So as I've said, it's important for us to understand we should be, we are blessed and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=266.68s)]
*  fortunate to have a president that is looking to bring an end, if possible, to a conflict [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=270.24s)]
*  that's cost billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives and destruction that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=274.54s)]
*  will take a generation for Ukrainians and others to be able to recover from. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=278.62s)]
*  I watched you in a couple of interviews and it frustrates me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=282.82s)]
*  Call him an evil dictator thug. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  Nobody's disagreeing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=288.54s)]
*  But at this point, if you want to get a negotiated settlement, that was tried for four years [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=289.94s)]
*  by Joe Biden. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=295.62s)]
*  At this point, it's time to hit the reset button. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=297.1s)]
*  Would that deal be a mineral deal first that would ensure U.S. presidents and also money [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=300.22s)]
*  for Ukraine to rebuild their country? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  Would the second phase be a ceasefire? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  Would the third phase be the negotiated settlement? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  Does that sound about right to you? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=312.54s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to pre-negotiate it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=314.42s)]
*  Look, at the end of the day, the Ukrainians are going to have their demands, the Russians [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  are going to have theirs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  We have to see how far apart they are if we get to that point in the process. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  And that's where diplomacy, that's what the vice president's point was. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=324.38000000000005s)]
*  That's where diplomacy kicks in. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  That's where the hard work of diplomacy becomes comes into play when you have to figure out [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=329.04s)]
*  how do you bridge this difference. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=332.96s)]
*  But this is not unique to this crisis. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=334.28s)]
*  It's what we're going through right now with Hamas and Israel and Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=336.0s)]
*  It's what's taken every war and every conflict that's ended in a truce, a ceasefire, whatever, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=339.32s)]
*  has all a peace plan, has all been the result of hard the hard work of diplomacy of bridging [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=344.28s)]
*  those differences. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=348.8s)]
*  But we have to begin that process. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=349.84s)]
*  And you can only do it if both sides are willing to do it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=351.04s)]
*  The Russians, look, they're not going to be easy to deal with either, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=353.68s)]
*  We have to figure out what they're willing to do by getting them to the table. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=357.24s)]
*  We couldn't do that if the Ukrainians are saying that they're not interested. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=360.62s)]
*  Now that's changed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=363.76s)]
*  And hopefully that's true. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=364.76s)]
*  And so I think the opening is now there to see what's possible. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=365.92s)]
*  And it would be in the benefit of everyone, the Russian people, the people of Ukraine, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=369.16s)]
*  the people of the United States, frankly, our European partners and allies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  It would be to their benefit as well to see this come to an end. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=375.88s)]
*  But there's only one person on the planet that can make that happen. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  And his name is Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=381.24s)]
*  And we need to be, we should be cheering that on and we should be supporting that, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=384.04s)]
*  not undermining it or calling it names the way, you know, some are doing in the media [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=387.48s)]
*  and some are doing internationally. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=391.36s)]
*  I want to put up on the screen truth social earlier today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  President Trump, release all the hostages now, not later. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=397.88s)]
*  Immediately return all the dead bodies of the people you murdered or it is over for [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  Only sick and twisted people keep bodies and you are sick and twisted. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=410.16s)]
*  Not a single Hamas member will be safe. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  If you don't do as I say, I have just met with your former hostages. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=416.62s)]
*  By the way, I ran into them in D.C. as well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=421.16s)]
*  Their stories are harrowing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  Whose lives you have destroyed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  This is your last warning. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza while you still have a chance. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=429.68s)]
*  Also, the people of Gaza, a beautiful future awaits, but not if you hold hostages. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  If you do, you are dead. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=439.18s)]
*  Make a smart decision. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=441.42s)]
*  Release the hostages now or there will be hell to pay later. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=443.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=447.42s)]
*  Now, I guess that's pretty clear. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=448.42s)]
*  Sure, unambiguous. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=449.94s)]
*  And I think both of us know President Trump well enough. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=450.94s)]
*  He means it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=454.08s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=455.08s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=456.08s)]
*  Well, hopefully they're going to do exactly what he just said. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=457.08s)]
*  You know how long we've been waiting for a long time in this country to have the kind [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=460.12s)]
*  of leadership with that kind of clarity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=463.2s)]
*  People don't realize the president meets with these people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=465.42s)]
*  He hears their stories. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=468.38s)]
*  He's outraged and rightfully so. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=469.64s)]
*  He's tired of watching these videos every weekend where hostages that are emaciated [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=471.44s)]
*  are released and bodies are turned over and sometimes it's the wrong bodies and this five [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=475.48s)]
*  here and three there and these games that are being played. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=479.6s)]
*  And he's lost his patience with it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=482.56s)]
*  He's been very clear about this from the beginning. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=483.96s)]
*  He's created space and time for this to be solved. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=485.6s)]
*  And now it's time for seeing it come to an end. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=488.12s)]
*  It's enough of this already. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=490.04s)]
*  These people have been in captivity now for over a year and a half. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=491.32s)]
*  These are monsters. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=494.3s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=495.3s)]
*  I wish there were more international pressure along the same lines here, but I'm glad he's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=496.72s)]
*  putting those statements out. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  I think he doesn't say these things and not mean it, as folks are finding out around the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=501.56s)]
*  world. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=505.68s)]
*  If he says he's going to do something, he'll do it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=506.68s)]
*  He'll do it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=508.08s)]
*  And so they better take that seriously. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  You were in the chamber last night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  You saw the Democrats with the little temper tantrum. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=516.2s)]
*  What was your reaction to it all? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=518.72s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's bizarre any time you're announcing that some young man has [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=521.08s)]
*  gotten into the U.S. Army Academy, when you announce that a young boy who's survived [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  brain cancer has been made a Secret Service deputy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=530.86s)]
*  These are usually things that people, when the First Lady's announced, these are usually [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=534.58s)]
*  things that people stand up and clap for. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=537.34s)]
*  Whether you like the person who's speaking as president or not, to see that not happen [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=539.42s)]
*  last night was kind of shocking, to be honest with you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=543.26s)]
*  It was really surprising and petty. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=545.06s)]
*  And I don't think it played well, but I'm a diplomat now, but I can tell you this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=547.74s)]
*  I didn't think it looked good on television. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=552.54s)]
*  And I've heard from a lot of people who didn't think it looked good either. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  The president talked about ending a war yesterday, and instead the only cheers we heard from [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  one side of the chamber was cheers for endless war and continuing to move forward. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  These are bizarre things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  We live in bizarre times, but I'm glad we have a president with moral clarity in Donald [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  J. Trump. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=571.0s)]
*  We're glad you are where you are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=572.0s)]
*  Although I'm not going to lie, I kind of like you as my senator in Florida. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=573.4s)]
*  I've got to be honest. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  I've got to be straightforward. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, you're in good hands. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  You're still in good hands. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=581.5999999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=582.5999999999999s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, thank you. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=583.6s)]
