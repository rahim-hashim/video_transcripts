# Sean Hannity: Trump will always stand up for Americans
**Fox News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs)
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight one thing is perfectly clear. If there was ever any doubt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=0.0s)]
*  American strength on the world stage, it is back, it is back big time. President Trump will [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=6.4s)]
*  always stand up for you, the American people. He's going to put America first. We're not going to be [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=11.6s)]
*  disrespected. We will not be swindled. We will not be bullied. Today, the Ukrainian President, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Zelensky, frankly, in many ways disgraced himself, lost an opportunity of a lifetime to stop the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=21.76s)]
*  death and destruction of his country. And he did it on the world stage. President Trump graciously [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=27.36s)]
*  invited him to the White House for a key minerals deal that he promised to sign, linking our two [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=32.8s)]
*  countries together with a long-term agreement. President Trump even offered to reset relations [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=39.04s)]
*  after Zelensky, you might recall, actually campaigned for Kamala Harris on the campaign trail. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Ukraine has received a steady flow of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=50.64s)]
*  and equipment from the U.S., including under Donald Trump, but under Biden and Harris, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=56.64s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars and not all of it accounted for far more than any other country [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=62.56s)]
*  in the world, including far more grants than the entire continent of Europe. But in the Oval Office, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=68.16s)]
*  while the cameras were rolling, Zelensky, seemingly ungrateful, combative, entitled, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=73.84s)]
*  and apparently Zelensky's ego seemed more important than the war-torn people in his own country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=78.48s)]
*  And his behavior is something I'm betting he's going to regret for a very long time. Take a look. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=84.96s)]
*  Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal. You want me to say [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=91.28s)]
*  really terrible things about Putin and then say, hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal? That [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=98.64s)]
*  doesn't work that way. I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=103.28s)]
*  United States of America and for the good of the world. He tried the pathway of Joe Biden [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=108.24s)]
*  of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States' words [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=114.8s)]
*  mattered more than the president of the United States' actions. What makes America a good country [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump is doing. What kind of diplomacy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=124.88s)]
*  JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean? I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=130.72s)]
*  going to end the destruction of your country. Yes, but if you are not strong... Mr. President, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=136.24s)]
*  with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=143.68s)]
*  to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=148.72s)]
*  for trying to bring it into this conflict. And do you think that it's respectful to come to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=153.12s)]
*  Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=157.68s)]
*  prevent the destruction of your country? A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=162.4s)]
*  First of all, during the war, everybody has problems. Even you, but you have nice ocean [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=166.96s)]
*  and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. God bless. You don't know that. God bless. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=173.28s)]
*  You don't know that. God bless. You will not have a war. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=178.96s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. I'm not telling you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=182.96s)]
*  Because you're in no position to dictate that. That's exactly what's in the war. You're not in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=186.96s)]
*  a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards. Right now, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=190.72s)]
*  you don't have your playing cards. You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=196.56s)]
*  of people. You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War Three. And what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=201.76s)]
*  you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. Have you said thank you once? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=208.48s)]
*  That entire meeting? No. In this entire meeting, have you said thank you? You went to Pennsylvania [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=214.64s)]
*  and campaigned for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=219.84s)]
*  States of America and the president who's trying to save your country. Please. You think that if [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=225.12s)]
*  you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak loudly? He's not speaking loudly. He's not [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=233.2s)]
*  speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. Can I answer? Wait a minute. No, no. You've done [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=237.2s)]
*  a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble. I know. You're not winning. You're not winning this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=241.28s)]
*  You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us. Mr. President, we are staying in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=247.36s)]
*  our country, staying strong from the very beginning of the war. We've been alone, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=252.0s)]
*  and we are thankful. I said thanks in this cabinet. You haven't been allowed. We gave you, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  through this stupid president, 350 billion dollars. We gave you military equipment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=261.2s)]
*  You voted for your president. And you men are brave, but they had to use our military equipment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  What about you? If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military equipment, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=270.32s)]
*  this war would have been over in two weeks. In three days. I heard it from Putin. I gave you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=276.4s)]
*  the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. You got to be more thankful [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards. But without us, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=289.12s)]
*  you don't have any cards. Given a chance today, he had a chance to sign a mineral deal that would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  lead to a very strong relationship with the U.S. After that, hopefully a ceasefire, then a negotiated [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=299.28s)]
*  settlement that would have been in the Ukrainian people's best interest and should have been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=305.28s)]
*  the president of Ukraine's goal. Instead, too much arrogance. The president of Ukraine, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=310.64s)]
*  seemingly ungrateful for the hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars used to fund this war. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=316.08s)]
*  Coming in, he wanted to dictate to the U.S. how he wants more aid to come in further, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=322.0s)]
*  how President Trump should take his side, which would only drag all of this out. And that would [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=328.08s)]
*  mean more death, more destruction, and a risk to the entire continent of Europe. As a result, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=333.36s)]
*  Ukraine's president was then booted out of the White House by the national security advisor, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Michael Waltz, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. held [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=343.76s)]
*  their head in shame. Lunch was canceled. A joint press conference also canceled. The signing of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  the minerals deal is off the table for now. The State Department has even already terminated funding [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=354.72s)]
*  for Ukraine's energy grid restoration, and President Trump instructed Zelensky to come back [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=359.76s)]
*  when he's ready for peace. And by the way, if there is a next time you might want to put on that suit, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=365.52s)]
*  it is the White House. Take a look. Why don't you wear a suit? Why don't you wear a suit? You're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=370.88s)]
*  the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=377.28s)]
*  own a suit? Yeah, yeah, I have problems. A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=382.88s)]
*  I don't have such. I will wear a costume after this war will finish. Yes, maybe [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=388.08s)]
*  one, maybe something like yours. Yes, maybe some something better. I don't know. We will see. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=396.08s)]
*  Maybe something cheaper than yeah. Thank you. Thank you. President. You need to keep in mind [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  historically this is not the first time that Zelensky has disrespected the U.S. You might [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=408.24s)]
*  recall Joe Biden reportedly lost his temper with Zelensky because of his insulting behavior, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=412.8s)]
*  his lack of gratitude. Apparently the president of Ukraine needed a wake up call. This isn't Europe. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=417.92s)]
*  Donald Trump was able to do something that Biden and Harris were not able to do, and that is bring [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  Vladimir Putin to the table. He has stated publicly he wants peace and this war to be over, as did [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=429.92s)]
*  President Zelensky. So today was a golden opportunity for Ukraine, all of Europe and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=436.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and Russia to stop all the death, all the destruction. And that opportunity passed [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  over today. And by the way, the U.S. has now demonstrated over and over again under Donald [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=449.36s)]
*  Trump. We can and we will defend ourselves regardless of what happens in Ukraine. And for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  the record, the oceans are not our only protectors. We have the most powerful military the world has [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=459.6s)]
*  ever seen. We own the sky. We own the seas. We own outer space. And President Trump is [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=465.44s)]
*  dedicated to producing the next generation of weaponry, including, as he often speaks about, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=471.28s)]
*  an iron dome that will one day perhaps save millions of lives. And our logistics are unmatched. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=476.8s)]
*  We don't need Ukraine. They do rely on us. And they have been as successful as they have been [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=483.68s)]
*  because of the hundreds of billions of dollars of your money that has been spent on this war [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=489.36s)]
*  that has ended right now on a stalemate. The American people stop paying that money. They [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=494.56s)]
*  will be in an awful position. You have generously supported them financially, militarily. We've [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=499.52s)]
*  offered humanitarian aid. And this, of course, in their brave fight against a truly malignant [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=505.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. Nobody disputes that. If this keeps going, there's not going to be a country left. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=510.56s)]
*  So let's be clear. Zelensky's behavior today at the White House, it's unacceptable. But don't take [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=518.08s)]
*  my word for it. On X, one of Ukraine's biggest supporters in Washington, Senator Lindsey Graham, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=523.68s)]
*  posted this. Unfortunately, America was disrespected and the deal is off. I have never [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  been more proud of President Trump, Vice President Vance, for standing up for America first. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=534.56s)]
*  And then Senator Graham went to the microphones, had this to say. Take a look. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=540.2399999999999s)]
*  Most Americans witnessing what they saw today would not want Zelensky to be their business partner, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=545.68s)]
*  including me. And I've been to Ukraine nine times since the war started. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=552.08s)]
*  I met with him this morning. President Trump I talked to last night, he was upbeat about the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=557.44s)]
*  deal. I've never been more proud of President Trump for showing the American people in the world, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=562.96s)]
*  you don't trifle with this man. And the question for me, for the Ukrainian people, I don't know [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=568.64s)]
*  if Zelensky can ever get you to where you want to go with the United States. Either he dramatically [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=575.6s)]
*  changes or you need to get somebody new. Wow, powerful words. Now feel free to turn [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=581.28s)]
*  off the noise on fake news CNN, MSDNC. In 1986, you may recall a similar cast of characters. They [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=587.04s)]
*  were in a state of panic. Remember Reagan walked away at the table from Reykjavik in the summit [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  with the Soviet Union over the issue of SDI, strategic defense, mocked by the media, Star Wars. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeiixs6FKs&t=600.0s)]
