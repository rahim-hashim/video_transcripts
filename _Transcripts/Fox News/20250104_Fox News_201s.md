# Jan. 20 can't happen fast enough, GOP senator says
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA)
*  All right. Here now with more is Florida Senator Rick Scott. And Senator, I want to continue on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=0.0s)]
*  with that discussion because how is it that the Republicans can get the nominees from Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=6.48s)]
*  in place as soon as possible? We heard Senator Thune talk about that as a priority, but what will [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=12.88s)]
*  the Democrats do to slow that down and why? And what can Republicans do to accelerate it as quickly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=18.16s)]
*  as possible? Well, like you said, January 20th can't happen fast enough and we've got to get [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  these nominees done. So the first thing we've got to do is starting January 6th, we've got to start [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=29.2s)]
*  going through committee by committee and get Pam Bondi out of the committee, get Pete Hedsoff out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=34.0s)]
*  of the committee, to get, you know, every nominee get done as quickly as possible. Then on January [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=39.36s)]
*  20th, we've got to stay here and just be voting on these nominees. The Democrats clearly have said [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=44.64s)]
*  they're going to try to obstruct because they do not want, they do not want Trump to have any [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=50.96s)]
*  success. So we've got to be willing to stay here week after week, work day after day to get these [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=55.92s)]
*  nominees done. If we need to do a recess appointments, allow Trump to do recess appointments, we need to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=62.08s)]
*  allow Trump to do recess appointments. We've got to get his team in place because something's got [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=66.88s)]
*  to change. The American public has completely lost trust with their federal government, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=72.08s)]
*  especially their federal law enforcement agencies. They've lost trust of Mayorkas, they've lost [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=76.64s)]
*  trust of Ray, they've lost trust of Merrick Garland. This has got to change. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=80.8s)]
*  Senator, one of my big concerns is January 20th itself, to protect the Capitol, the inauguration, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=86.96s)]
*  make sure that President Trump is safely there in the White House with JD Vance is imperative. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  But somehow, someway, some idiot also scheduled the national championship football game to be that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=99.44s)]
*  same day on January 20th. I don't know how the intelligence services and all their expertise can [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=105.92s)]
*  handle two major events on the same day. How could this possibly happen? How in the world is Homeland [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=111.44s)]
*  Security, Secret Service, all of these other intelligence agencies, how in the world are they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=120.16s)]
*  supposed to do that on January 20th? Well, as you know, for the last four years, they've been out [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=124.64s)]
*  to lunch. They clearly have not been doing their job. They've not been protecting America. I'm on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=130.8s)]
*  Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, and Mayorkas and Ray were supposed to come testify last [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=136.8s)]
*  month and canceled. They didn't want to come talk about threats on our homeland. So, I mean, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=141.44s)]
*  they have just completely lost trust, they've lost focus, there's no transparency. So yeah, I agree. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  It does not make sense that we'd have two significant events like this on the same day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, Senator, look, you've also been a governor, highly successful. You know how this is supposed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=162.8s)]
*  to run at the local level. I'm glad you're on Homeland Security and hopefully get those nominees [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=167.2s)]
*  as quickly as possible, because those two agencies, Homeland Security, Department of Justice, cannot be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  turned around fast enough. But man, that is a massive task to do, literally, more than 370,000 [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  people between those two departments and agencies. So good luck to you there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onlrzieHJA&t=183.84s)]
