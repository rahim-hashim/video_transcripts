# Hannity: This could be a 'huge win' for Trump
**Fox News:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8)
*  It is the new day in New York City. Take a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=0.0s)]
*  You see, that was a construction site in New York City, Midtown Manhattan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Local workers there greeting Trump as warmly as anyone could ever want to be greeted, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=17.52s)]
*  delivering a very special message, by the way, to Joe Biden with their own version of—how [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=22.96s)]
*  should I put this? Let's go, Brandon. This was before another mandatory appearance in court for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=28.4s)]
*  Donald Trump. It'll go on for weeks and weeks. They have taken him off the campaign trail. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=34.72s)]
*  A pro-Biden judge censoring Trump's speech with an unprecedented gag order prevented the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=39.6s)]
*  Republican candidate for president from campaigning in the middle of this election. Of course, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=45.04s)]
*  he donated in 2020 to Joe Biden issues about conflicts, issues about—oh, that's right, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=50.56s)]
*  statute of limitations, issues about the whole felony federal crime that they're trying to make [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=56.16s)]
*  out of thin air. But nothing is stopping Donald Trump from speaking to you directly, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=62.08s)]
*  the American people. Take a look. We're very close in New York, I understand, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=66.8s)]
*  and we're leading in the country by a lot. A poll just came out a little while ago, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  as you saw yesterday, that we're up in every swing state and up by a lot in every swing state. So [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=75.6s)]
*  I think we're going to do very well, and we're going to make a play for New York. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=82.08s)]
*  They said, I just heard there was a very good poll came out. Normally, a Democrat will win New [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=85.2s)]
*  York. Biden is the worst president in history, and we have some very bad people here, but we [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=90.48s)]
*  have the greatest people, and they're right behind me. And they all want us to run, and we're going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=95.12s)]
*  to run very hard in New York. New York, we have a good chance of winning New York, in my opinion, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=100.08s)]
*  but we're going to give it a shot. All right, Trump then headed to court in lower Manhattan [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=104.4s)]
*  for a case that even a New York Times op-ed referred to as a legal embarrassment and a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=109.76s)]
*  historic mistake, 230 miles to the south in the Washington swamp. Well, important, very important [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  oral arguments today at the U.S. Supreme Court on presidential immunity. A decision here will [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  not only have an immediate impact on the weaponized DOJ quest to prosecute Trump from now until [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=129.76s)]
*  Election Day in 193 days, but it will have lasting ramifications, or as Neil Gorsuch, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  as the justice put it, we are writing a rule for the ages. The question at hand, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=143.28s)]
*  can a U.S. president be prosecuted for his actions in office? Is there absolute immunity? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=148.8s)]
*  Is there limited immunity? Can Obama be charged, for example, for killing Americans [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=155.36s)]
*  in a drone strike, which happened overseas? Can George W. Bush be charged with allegedly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=161.44s)]
*  lying to Congress about Iraq if a far-left prosecutor decides to cook up charges? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=167.28s)]
*  And can Joe Biden be charged for killing a family in Afghanistan during his deadly withdrawal? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=173.68s)]
*  Now, here's how Trump's legal team put it earlier today. Listen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=180.88s)]
*  The implications of the court's decision here extend far beyond the facts of this case. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=184.8s)]
*  Could President George W. Bush have been sent to prison for obstructing an official proceeding [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=192.32s)]
*  or allegedly lying to Congress to induce war in Iraq? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Could President Obama be charged with murder for killing U.S. citizens abroad by drone strike? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  All right. Ultimately, the constitutional judges on the court seem to favor limited immunity over [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=211.04s)]
*  absolute immunity, but in other words, that would be a huge win for Donald Trump. Official [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=216.48s)]
*  acts carried out by a president would be immune from prosecution. However, a president could still [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=221.28s)]
*  be charged for personal acts like taking bribes, oh, maybe from like the former first lady of Moscow. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=226.88s)]
*  That's right, the Russian oligarch that Joe had dinner with at Cafe Milano. Take a listen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=233.12s)]
*  If an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly contested election knows that a real possibility [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=238.8s)]
*  after leaving office is not that the president is going to be able to go off into a peaceful [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=250.88s)]
*  retirement, but that the president may be criminally prosecuted by a bitter political opponent, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=256.0s)]
*  will that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=263.92s)]
*  Did you agree that there are some core functions of the executive that a president conduct that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=273.12s)]
*  Congress cannot criminalize? Yes. So is that a form? I mean, we can call it immunity or you can [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=279.2s)]
*  call it they can't do it, but what's the difference? Does the president have immunity or are you saying [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=284.4s)]
*  that there's no immunity presidential immunity even for official acts? Yes, Justice Thomas. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=291.76s)]
*  So do you really want your president thinking, any president at any time, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=299.92s)]
*  thinking about his own personal legal exposure on every official decision that they make? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=304.0s)]
*  Most presidents, especially ones without any moral courage, like we're witnessing with Joe Biden and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=309.76s)]
*  Israel, they would be utterly paralyzed, which he kind of is, but naturally the left-wing justices, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=315.36s)]
*  who are probably eager to see Trump behind bars, well, they propose this obscene hypothetical [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=321.52s)]
*  scenario, which, by the way, is not what people have been talking about in reality. That's not [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=328.56s)]
*  what the discussion is, but they throw it out as a nice red herring anyway. Listen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=333.76s)]
*  If the president decides that his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=339.12s)]
*  orders someone to assassinate him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=350.88s)]
*  It would depend on the hypothetical, but we can see that could well be an official act. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=358.8s)]
*  It could, and why? Because he's doing it for personal reasons. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=361.92s)]
*  Now, under limited immunity, a president would still be charged for committing that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=367.12s)]
*  illegal act because of the personal benefits. Now, this leaves us with three main questions [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=370.96s)]
*  tonight. What will the justices ultimately decide? When will they make their decision? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=376.8s)]
*  And will it completely upend? I think it will. The weaponized DOJ charges against Donald Trump. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=382.16s)]
*  Will they will they remand it back to a lower court? Jonathan Turley, Greg Jarrett, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz will weigh in straight ahead. But first, more disruptive hate-filled protests today, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=392.8s)]
*  more clashes with police, and some universities now have thankfully restored order like the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  University of Texas. They issued a very clear directive. Our university will not be occupied. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=404.24s)]
*  Well, good for them. Other schools, they refuse to enforce their own rules and keep their students [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=411.52s)]
*  safe as they let far-left professors, students, and outside agitators continue to upend life for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=417.2s)]
*  all students. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News' YouTube page [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoigzhQhHa8&t=424.0s)]
