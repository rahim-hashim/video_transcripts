# Sean Hannity: Biden is not capable of serving as your president
**Fox News:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk)
*  Today marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=3.36s)]
*  while the tide of Normandy ran red with blood, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  thousands of brave young men, American men, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=12.72s)]
*  far away from home, storming the beaches in northern France [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  amid a hail of gunfire, no cover whatsoever, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  2,501 Americans lost their lives that day, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=24.32s)]
*  but it was not in vain because this marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  and Adolf Hitler, and less than a year later, the war in Europe was finally over. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=33.6s)]
*  Now, today, President Biden was in Normandy to commemorate this solemn day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=38.4s)]
*  It was important for the president to be there, but, well, unfortunately, as per usual, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=42.8s)]
*  it wasn't Jack Dub Joe. He seemed totally, completely out of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=48.0s)]
*  Biden struggled with where to walk, where to sit, where to stand, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=51.2s)]
*  even appeared to doze off at times and looked generally uneasy during the entire trip, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=55.12s)]
*  as FoxNews.com reported, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=60.56s)]
*  Biden's perpetual state of confusion on display in Normandy amid rising cognitive questions, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=63.28s)]
*  unquote. This comes just two days after a bombshell report from the Wall Street Journal titled, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=69.2s)]
*  quote, Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're just figuring that out? Not the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=79.52s)]
*  the people around him. According to interviews conducted with more than 45 people, the president [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=82.64s)]
*  is performing poorly behind closed doors. Now, this despite outlandish and uncorroborated claims [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  from the White House that Biden is always the sharpest person in the room during meetings. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  And remember, Joe Biden accomplishes more in an hour than most of you accomplish in a day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=100.56s)]
*  That's like up there with one of the biggest lies this White House has ever told. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=107.68s)]
*  And while seeing is believing, and aside from Biden's weird jacked up performance at the State [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=112.4s)]
*  of the Union, it is extremely rare to see Joe string two coherent sentences together. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=117.36s)]
*  That's why according to a brand new poll, look at this, a whopping 70% of voters support drug [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=123.28s)]
*  tests at the upcoming presidential debates. Hey, Joe, if you got nothing to hide but a little bit [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=131.84s)]
*  of Red Bull, well, then listen to the American people. Take the drug test. And aside from a rare, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=138.56s)]
*  overly energetic performance every other day seems to be a massive struggle for your president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=145.36s)]
*  Now he's full of whispering and, you know, here's the deal. Here's the deal. You know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=151.12s)]
*  so far during the trip to France, Biden has already mixed up Russia with Ukraine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=156.96s)]
*  He also said he's known Vladimir Putin for 40 years. Really, Joe? Extremely unlikely, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=161.36s)]
*  unless Biden knew that Putin was a young KGB officer. Throughout his trip to France, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=167.36s)]
*  Biden has relied on his handlers and his wife to guide him through literally every step. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=173.12s)]
*  It's embarrassing, frankly hard to watch. Let's state the obvious. Joe Biden is just not capable [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=178.56s)]
*  of serving as your president. The interview I did last night, we have part two tonight with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=184.4s)]
*  President Trump, is not an interview he'd be capable of giving. A second term should be out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=188.56s)]
*  of the question. But in lieu of the functioning candidate, well, the Democratic Party is relying [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=194.0s)]
*  on lawfare and the weaponization of justice to smear Donald Trump and take him down. Yep, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=199.2s)]
*  they're weaponizing our justice system for mere political gain. They're trying to jail Joe Biden's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=205.36s)]
*  chief political rival and now lacking any and all self-awareness. These same Democrats, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=212.32s)]
*  they are deeply concerned at what Trump might do to the justice system during a second term. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=217.68s)]
*  In reality, well, Donald Trump is fighting, is not fighting for revenge. He's fighting to restore [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=223.84s)]
*  America's justice system and constitutional order so no one has to face the political persecution [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=230.0s)]
*  that he's been facing simply because of their last name or their party affiliation. As Trump said on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=238.0s)]
*  this program last night, lawfare, it has to stop. It does if we want to remain a constitutional [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=244.0s)]
*  republic. Take a look. People are claiming you want retribution. People are claiming you want [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=250.56s)]
*  what has happened to you done to Democrats. Would you do that ever? Look, what's happened to me has [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=257.2s)]
*  never happened in this country before and it has to stop because- Wait a minute, I want to hear that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=263.04s)]
*  again. It has to stop. Well, it does have to stop because we're not going to have a country- [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=268.64s)]
*  It does have to stop. We're not going to have a country left. Now compare that to Biden's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=274.08s)]
*  response when asked about allegations of lawfare. Take a look. Mr. President, can you tell us, sir, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=278.4s)]
*  Donald Trump refers to himself as a political prisoner and blames you directly? What's your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  response to that, sir? Do you think the conviction will have an impact on the campaign? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=289.76s)]
*  We'd love to hear your thoughts, sir. Should you be on the ballot, sir? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=298.88s)]
*  You don't find that creepy? I do. But tonight, despite everything we have seen from Biden and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=301.84s)]
*  other Democrats, it is Donald Trump taking the high road. Does anyone really believe Biden when [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=310.56s)]
*  he said today that he wouldn't pardon Hunter? Take a look. Your son Hunter is on trial and I know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  that you cannot speak about an ongoing federal prosecution, but let me ask you, will you accept [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=323.12s)]
*  the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is? Yes. And have you ruled out a pardon [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=330.08s)]
*  for your son? Yes. For Joe, politics, appearances, they seem to matter the most. Remember, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=335.52s)]
*  the border's secure and the border's closed. And by the way, he gets more done in an hour than you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=342.56s)]
*  do in an entire day. You know, contrast it here with Donald Trump showing real empathy, sympathy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  for Hunter Biden's addiction by sharing his own heartfelt story about a family member with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=353.2s)]
*  addiction. Take a look. You don't drink. No. Never have. No. Never had a drink. No. I had a brother [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=358.4s)]
*  who suffered tremendously from alcoholism and alcohol, and it was a terrible thing to watch. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=365.84s)]
*  He was an incredible guy with the best personality. He was the best looking person you've ever seen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Everything was perfect, but he had an addiction. And so I understand addiction because I, you know, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=380.56s)]
*  was very close. He was very close to me. He was an incredible guy, but he suffered a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=385.68s)]
*  tremendous, and I've had many friends, but my brother suffered tremendously from this addiction. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=389.84s)]
*  So in spite of this phony characterization by the media mob and Democrats, Donald Trump is not running [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  to become some kind of third world dictator. He's not trying to rewrite the constitution. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=401.28s)]
*  He's pledging not to abuse power. This is simply a caricature created by psychotic Trump haters [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=407.28s)]
*  on the hard left and in the media mob. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBZhFLxGubk&t=414.8s)]
