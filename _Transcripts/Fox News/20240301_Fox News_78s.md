# We the people have WOKEN UP!: Brownsville Texas resident on Biden’s visit
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk)
*  We sent our very own Sarah Carter to find out. Take a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=0.0s)]
*  How do you feel about [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=3.52s)]
*  President Biden coming to Brownsville now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=5.84s)]
*  It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=8.32s)]
*  He should be ashamed of himself after all the things that this community have gone through. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=9.84s)]
*  We're here to show that we are tired of Joe Biden. We want Trump's policies back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=15.36s)]
*  Get your hands off of our country. He sold us out. We know. We know what he's done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=19.48s)]
*  He sold us out to China, sold us out to other countries. We're informed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=24.76s)]
*  We're not asleep here in the Rio Grande Valley. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=29.48s)]
*  If you had a message for President Biden, if you could talk to him today, what would your message be? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=31.96s)]
*  Undo every one of those executive orders you signed on your first day in office. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=36.84s)]
*  That would be starters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=41.08s)]
*  It's a photo office, what it is. And he must have done it last minute because Trump was visiting the border. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=42.28s)]
*  He's not welcomed here. That we the people have woken up and we've seen his policies, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  the disaster here on the border. And just so you know, we don't support him here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=55.64s)]
*  It took you three years to get here, Joe Biden. And now what are you going to do with this mess? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5C1ZJ3FIk&t=60.28s)]
