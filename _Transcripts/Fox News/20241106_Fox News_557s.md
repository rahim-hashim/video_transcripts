# Sean Hannity: Trump will work tirelessly to make America great again
**Fox News:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8)
*  I'm not going to spike the football tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=0.0s)]
*  We wish Kamala, all her supporters, well, in spite of how horribly, despicably, repulsively [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=2.88s)]
*  they have treated many of us, President Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=10.28s)]
*  We're not garbage. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=13.32s)]
*  We're not Nazis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=14.32s)]
*  We're not fascists. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=15.32s)]
*  And, in fact, in many ways, this is a good day for all Americans, even those that maybe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=16.32s)]
*  supported the Harris campaign. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Despite some fearmongery on the left, Donald Trump is not going to rule as a dictator. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Remember, he was president for four years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  He will not be imprisoning his political opponents or take his haters off the airways. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=31.4s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, the conspiracy theorist, will spread her lies and misinformation in perpetuity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=38.04s)]
*  Trump's second term will not be about retribution. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=44.4s)]
*  Frankly, there is too much work to be done to fix this country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=46.8s)]
*  I mean, that's the bottom line. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=49.92s)]
*  Isn't that what elections are really all about? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  So, despite the incessant lying of the radical extreme left in this country, the president-elect, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=54.6s)]
*  Donald Trump, will work tirelessly within the bounds of the Constitution to make America [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=59.88s)]
*  great again, safer, freer, more prosperous and a better place for all Americans. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=65.68s)]
*  That's his mandate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=71.16s)]
*  No more lawfare. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  No more censorship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=73.56s)]
*  Lower taxes, lower interest rates, a secure border, the biggest national security threat [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=75.2s)]
*  we have, better trade policies, free and fair trade, safer streets, no more woke madness [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=80.84s)]
*  and insanity, fewer regulations, lower prices at the grocery store and at gas stations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  This is what you, all of you, the American people, voted for, and this is what Donald [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  Trump ran on and will try to deliver on, and I have every confidence he will deliver. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  He did the first time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, it's not going to be easy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Nothing really has ever been easy for Donald Trump, has it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=110.52s)]
*  The hoaxes, the lies, the misinformation, conspiracy theories, the witch hunts, the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  bogus impeachments, lawsuits, nonstop reckless hatred, hysteria from the state-run media [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  mob, kicked off Twitter, his house was raided by the feds, he was charged with dozens and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=125.4s)]
*  dozens of manufactured felonies, one packed on top of the other, and of course, deranged [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=131.32s)]
*  would-be assassins, one coming within one millimeter of killing him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, with blood running down his face, we'll never forget, will we? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=142.44s)]
*  He stood up, he put his fist in the air, and he yelled, fight, fight, fight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=146.36s)]
*  And that's what he's going to do for every American. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=151.88s)]
*  It is the nature of who he is, regardless of your race, your gender, your religion, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=156.12s)]
*  identity or your politics. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=161.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=164.0s)]
*  We're going to help our country heal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=165.08s)]
*  We're going to help our country heal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=169.56s)]
*  We have a country that needs help. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=170.84s)]
*  I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=173.64s)]
*  47th president and your 45th president. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=180.12s)]
*  And to every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=188.2s)]
*  Every single day, I will be fighting for you, and with every breath in my body, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=201.0s)]
*  children deserve and that you deserve. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=205.96s)]
*  This will truly be the golden age of America. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=213.32s)]
*  And last night, President Trump did well among almost every group demographic you can think [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  of. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=221.88s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  He made real gains among both men and women and Hispanic American voters and African [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=223.08s)]
*  American voters and even young voters. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=228.44000000000003s)]
*  And to the surprise of the hosts at fake news, CNN, Kamala's underperformance, you know, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  all over the country, it just, well, frankly, took him by surprise. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=237.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  So you asked, are there any places that the vice president is overperforming Joe Biden [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=242.44s)]
*  in 2020? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=246.44s)]
*  So we could show you that as well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=247.0s)]
*  We just bring that out here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=248.12s)]
*  Harris overperforming 2020. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=249.4s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=251.24s)]
*  There you go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  So let this go away and see if there's anything in the East side there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=252.84s)]
*  Literally nothing? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=256.6s)]
*  Literally nothing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=257.72s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=260.68s)]
*  There was a massive shift in every state, even deep blue New Jersey. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=261.88s)]
*  New Jersey was within five points, Illinois around eight points. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=266.04s)]
*  But Democratic leaders, this should serve as a wake up call. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=269.88s)]
*  America is sick and tired of your failed policies, of your rigid wokeism. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=274.04s)]
*  But sadly, many in the media mob, they just can't see the writing on the wall. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=280.6s)]
*  According to certain left-wing hosts, racists, sexists were to blame for last night's results. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what happened last night. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=290.44s)]
*  Racism and sexism. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=291.72s)]
*  No, but take a look anyway. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=294.12s)]
*  Democrats need to be mature and they need to be honest. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  And they need to say, yes, there is, there's misogyny. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=300.44s)]
*  But it's not just misogyny from white men. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=304.92s)]
*  It's misogyny from Hispanic men. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  It's misogyny from black men. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  Things we've all been talking about who do not want a woman leading them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=312.68s)]
*  Black voters came through for Kamala Harris. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  White women voters did not. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=319.48s)]
*  That is what it appears happened in that state. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=322.12s)]
*  This will be the second opportunity that white women in this country have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=324.6s)]
*  to change the way that they interact with the patriarchy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  She is a person of color. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  She is a she. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=334.12s)]
*  And she is in an interracial marriage. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=335.48s)]
*  And I wonder, I have this question mark. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=337.88s)]
*  In my mind, over whether all of those things combined was too much for pockets of this country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=340.52s)]
*  Let's be honest about this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, let's be absolutely blunt about it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  There were appeals to racism in this campaign and there is racial bias in this country and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=352.12s)]
*  there is sexism in this country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=357.64s)]
*  And anybody who thinks that that did not in any way impact on the outcome of this race is wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Remember that whole narrative got started by Barack Obama. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=366.44s)]
*  The brothers and misogyny and they don't want a woman and then Stacey Abrams follows it up with, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=369.72s)]
*  yeah, you know, African American men, there's racism and there's sexism. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  Look, the Trump haters, I get it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=381.48s)]
*  You're not in a good place right now. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=383.56s)]
*  We'll give you a little bit of latitude. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=385.16s)]
*  Some on the left even melting down on social media. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=387.72s)]
*  Some of it is actually quite hilarious after the Empire State building lit up red [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=391.48s)]
*  to commemorate Donald Trump's win. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=398.04s)]
*  And meanwhile, comedian, listen to this, Jerry Seinfeld called out his kids old school. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=405.72s)]
*  They're giving, you can't even make it up, distressed students. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  They're distressed over the election results. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=411.8s)]
*  The day off after the election, forget about the land of the free, the home of the brave. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=414.92s)]
*  Now the home of what? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=421.88s)]
*  Liberal snowflakes? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=423.16s)]
*  You know, one left-wing group is now even sending out texts. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  I got this from a friend of mine. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=428.36s)]
*  I just got this text encouraging Democrats to grieve with loved ones [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  and then take to the streets. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcgBfYJGI8&t=437.56s)]
