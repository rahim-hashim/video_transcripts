# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 4 2024
**Fox News:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE)
*  Now, when the history of this campaign is written, will it be Trump's victory, the greatest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=0.0s)]
*  political comeback of all time, or will it be Harris won by hiding from the press and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=5.98s)]
*  denying a record? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=10.74s)]
*  Well, just on the numbers alone, the race does seem very tight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=11.74s)]
*  The spread is a mere 2.2 percent, with Harris up 49.1 to 46.9 in real clear politics. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=16.42s)]
*  But the trends, and I love trends, analyzing them is so much fun, seem to be for MAGA momentum. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=23.88s)]
*  Important to note that 46.9 percent is the best Trump has ever performed nationally at [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=30.14s)]
*  this point in the race. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=35.66s)]
*  Look at where he was in 2020 at the same point. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=37.78s)]
*  He was trailing Biden by 8.1 percent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=40.6s)]
*  And October 4th, 2016, the RCP average had Trump behind Hillary by 5.8 percent. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=44.56s)]
*  Of course, Trump went on to win. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=50.18s)]
*  And even better news, since the Electoral College is what matters, of course, Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=52.5s)]
*  is up ever so slightly by 0.1 in the battleground state average. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=56.64s)]
*  Again, what really counts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=61.72s)]
*  And some insights from a few of the newest polls out there tonight, pollster Scott Rasmussen [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=63.96s)]
*  with Napolitans News. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  They also have the national race tied. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=70.6s)]
*  He surveyed almost 3000 likely voters. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=72.68s)]
*  The hurricane response by the Biden-Harris administration, that's certainly not going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=76.44s)]
*  to help them in either Georgia or North Carolina. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=79.8s)]
*  But there's a wrinkle to that, and I'll get to that in a moment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, look, Americans know leadership when they see it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=85.4s)]
*  And Trump got to Georgia before either Biden or Harris did. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=89.12s)]
*  And even even the federal government, remember, took just days for someone like an Elon Musk [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=92.8s)]
*  to get there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=100.84s)]
*  And he said he could restore Internet service to most of the region if the government would [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=102.24s)]
*  just get out of the way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=105.4s)]
*  Of course, Musk would use Starlink. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=106.4s)]
*  He's ready and willing to do so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=108.92s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise that the betting markets have begun to move back toward Trump because [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  of these factors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And the main reason that Trump still leads Kamala on the most important issue to voters, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=117.84s)]
*  which is still the economy, because of high prices. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=122.12s)]
*  People are making less money in real terms than they were four years ago. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=126.04s)]
*  Most Americans, working class Americans, feel and are poorer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=130.24s)]
*  Now I went to the grocery store today to get a few things for my daughter, who's coming [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  home from college. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=138.36s)]
*  I almost fell over when I was checking out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=140.2s)]
*  Like a box of cereal cost eight dollars? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=147.6s)]
*  Like for most families, this just is not sustainable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=148.6s)]
*  Now even at this point, CNN cannot deny the right track, wrong track numbers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Just 28 percent of Americans think the U.S. is on the right track. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=156.92s)]
*  And I want you to put that in a perspective, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  When does the average when the incumbent party loses the election? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=164.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  It's just 25 percent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  This to me is a bad sign for Kamala Harris's campaign. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=169.36s)]
*  The bottom line is it looks a lot more like a loser than it does like a winner when it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=173.52s)]
*  comes to the country being on the right track. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Ruh-roh. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=180.84s)]
*  Well, this is why Harris and Biden were crowing today about the jobs numbers, trying to shift [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=181.84s)]
*  that momentum back to her. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=187.24s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty four thousand new jobs created in September. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=189.0s)]
*  But I have to say this tonight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=192.72000000000003s)]
*  What do you think the chances are that those numbers are going to be revised downward in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=194.96s)]
*  a few months like all the other monthly gains were? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=198.72s)]
*  I'd say the chances are pretty high. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=202.0s)]
*  Second, dig into the data and the picture is not great at all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=203.84s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=209.24s)]
*  The numbers actually show that we lost seven thousand manufacturing jobs in the United [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=210.24s)]
*  States and much of the growth is coming from, wait for it, government jobs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=215.96s)]
*  One hundred and seven thousand new ones since July. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=220.88s)]
*  Thirty one thousand from August to September. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=223.48s)]
*  Thanks, Kamala. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=226.76s)]
*  That's what we need. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=228.38s)]
*  More bureaucratic bloat. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=229.78s)]
*  And we know this as well, that most of the jobs are going to foreign born workers and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=232.06s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=237.42s)]
*  Over the last year, they've gained one point two million jobs while native born workers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=238.94s)]
*  dropped eight hundred and twenty five thousand jobs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, of course, Trump hit this today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=247.9s)]
*  You have illegals coming in and they're taking the jobs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=250.5s)]
*  And when you look at the numbers from that standpoint, it's a shame. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=255.26s)]
*  We have to get the jobs of the people that have lived here for a long time and they're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=257.74s)]
*  great, great citizens of our country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=260.98s)]
*  Now none of this is great for American citizens. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  Not good news at all. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=268.1s)]
*  Bigger government, more illegals taking opportunities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  So no wonder working class union types are moving toward Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=272.64s)]
*  When unions that were historically endorsing Democrats are suddenly announcing that, well, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=276.26s)]
*  we're staying on the sidelines this year, we're not going to endorse anyone. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=281.74s)]
*  Well, that means one thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  Their membership wants Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=287.18s)]
*  The International Association of Firefighters voted not to endorse any candidate that's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=290.66s)]
*  seen as a blow to Harris just weeks after the team search union did the same. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=294.74s)]
*  Of course, working class Americans, they watch as the federal government coddles illegals [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  but craters life for everyone else and Hispanic voters. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=305.1s)]
*  They are more than just fed up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=309.38s)]
*  A record number now supporting Trump in swing states like Arizona and Nevada. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=312.22s)]
*  Key key demographic. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=317.66s)]
*  Of course, Kamala's response to all this is no response at all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=319.66s)]
*  We will not be gaslighted. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  And he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  But we know the facts and we know the truth. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  Of course, the media is never going to fact check her claims. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=340.52s)]
*  Trump's policies brought strong wage growth to blue collar workers. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  Undeniable, documented, you know, read the data, Kamala. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=348.24s)]
*  At the end of 2019, inflation was under 2% and gas was about $2.30 a gallon. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=352.12s)]
*  Well, I filled up my tank yesterday. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  It was $4.63 a gallon. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=360.32s)]
*  I took a photo. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  $82 to fill my tank. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  This is just totally unnecessary. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=366.76s)]
*  And it should make you furious every time you go to the pump, anytime you pay for anything [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=369.0s)]
*  these days. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=373.44s)]
*  So, again, to review the economy, the border, hurricane management, unrest in the Middle [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=374.44s)]
*  East, a stalemate at best in Ukraine, and then a Democrat ticket hiding from the press. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=379.92s)]
*  All these factors should make this an easy Trump win. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=387.16s)]
*  And the Democrats are obviously concerned. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=391.92s)]
*  And they didn't really think. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=395.12s)]
*  I don't think that Wisconsin would be this close, but it is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=397.2s)]
*  Even liberal Tammy Baldwin's Senate seat is not a sure thing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  So in these final weeks of the campaign, expect a blitz of appearances by the Obamas and other [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  celebrities, the usual suspects. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  They're going to be trying to whip up enthusiasm for four more years of a figurehead president. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=413.84s)]
*  Because if you're out there and you think, you know, Biden was so bad, why on earth would [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  you think Kamala would be any better? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=425.8s)]
*  She's just as inarticulate, but less experienced and more irritating. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  For all these reasons, at least right now, it seems like MAGA rising as America is ready [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=434.24s)]
*  to turn the page on a sad four years. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's the state of the race. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=443.88s)]
*  Today Washington saw a ghost. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=445.72s)]
*  Hey, folks. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  My name is Joe Biden. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  Welcome Mr. President. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=455.0s)]
*  We've been waiting for you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=456.0s)]
*  Welcome to the swimming pool. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=457.0s)]
*  It was the first time Biden ever set foot in the briefing room as president. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=459.08s)]
*  The press was stunned. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=463.04s)]
*  Peter Ducey's wig fell off. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=465.12s)]
*  And every channel in America cut straight to it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=467.6s)]
*  We were actually about to go live to Vice President Kamala Harris, who's speaking right [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=471.28s)]
*  now in Detroit, Michigan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=475.52s)]
*  And apparently she's talking about this port strike ending. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=477.52s)]
*  She's trying to appeal to union workers. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=480.88s)]
*  And yet you have the president of the United States come out clearly overshadowing her [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=483.04s)]
*  answering significant questions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  Is that a communications mistake? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=490.0s)]
*  Is the left hand not talking to the right hand? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=491.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris was about to go on TV and take credit for ending the port strike. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=494.32s)]
*  And Biden looked and said, oh, no, you don't. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  And big footed her. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=502.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden wanted full credit. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=504.0s)]
*  He's a lame duck, but even lame ducks care about their legacy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=506.12s)]
*  If you're the Harris campaign, it's like Biden's haunting you from the grave. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=510.0s)]
*  Since the coup, Biden hasn't left his room for 43 days. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=514.16s)]
*  He's gone 43 days without anybody laying eyes on him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=519.24s)]
*  There's a ghost in the White House. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=523.0s)]
*  And in 15 minutes, that ghost spooked the Harris campaign. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=525.38s)]
*  I'm in constant contact with her. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=530.0s)]
*  She's aware we're singing from the same song sheet. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=532.1s)]
*  She helped pass all the laws of being employed now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=536.56s)]
*  She was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation, which [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  we were told we could never pass. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  And so she's been and her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=549.2399999999999s)]
*  doing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden just said Kamala is responsible for the last four years. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  That is going to hurt. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=561.56s)]
*  Seeing Biden again brought back memories. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=563.64s)]
*  Biden and the press were catching up on all of their favorite topics. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=566.52s)]
*  The election is a month away. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=570.0s)]
*  One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=572.28s)]
*  And then also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=576.6s)]
*  it will be peaceful? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=583.0s)]
*  Two separate questions. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=585.4s)]
*  Very much. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=586.4s)]
*  I'm confident it'll be free and fair. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=587.4s)]
*  I don't know whether it'll be peaceful. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=589.96s)]
*  The president of the United States should say this is going to be a free and fair election [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=592.12s)]
*  and we have everything under control. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=597.04s)]
*  He shouldn't say, I don't know, could get a little violent. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=599.76s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=604.16s)]
*  But it was time for Biden to leave. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=606.68s)]
*  The reporters asked him to get back in the race. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=608.68s)]
*  Do you want to reconsider dropping out of the race? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=611.64s)]
*  I'm back in. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=615.96s)]
*  It's actually funny, but the reporters see the same poll numbers we do. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  Biden might have a better shot and he still thinks he can win. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=624.08s)]
*  Biden deep down wants Kamala to lose. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=629.24s)]
*  First Lady Jill Biden isn't on the campaign trail with Kamala. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=633.6s)]
*  Biden's not on the campaign trail with Kamala. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=637.44s)]
*  He's actually hurting her campaign, saying she co-signed all of his economic policies [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=640.12s)]
*  and then kicking her off TV so she couldn't get credit for the port deal. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=645.52s)]
*  If Kamala Harris loses, Biden will blame one guy, Barack Obama. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=650.04s)]
*  This would be the second time Barack forced Joe out in 2016 for Hillary and 2024 for Harris, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=657.04s)]
*  with Trump beating them both times. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=663.76s)]
*  If Biden sees Kamala go down, he'll look at Barry and say, I told you so. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  That's if they're even talking, because they're not talking right now. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=672.8s)]
*  But someone's going to be doing a lot of talking. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=676.12s)]
*  That's Barack. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=679.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris's internal poll numbers must be so bad. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=680.6s)]
*  They're making the Messiah leave Hawaii to hit the trail for the home stretch. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=684.12s)]
*  President Obama, they are calling on him to go to Pittsburgh next week as they lean on his star power [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=689.36s)]
*  to turn out the vote, his star power among Democrats at least. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=695.56s)]
*  And we have seen this to great effect in several last election cycles, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=699.56s)]
*  where Obama is sort of called in in the final hour in order to thwart Democratic complacency. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=704.8s)]
*  Barack Obama's having second thoughts about the second, second coming Kamala Harris. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=711.64s)]
*  Taylor Swift didn't do it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=717.16s)]
*  Walls blew it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  Now Obama has to come in and stop the bleeding. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=719.28s)]
*  I have to ask you about your old boss on the campaign trail. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=723.28s)]
*  You say you're dubious of celebrity endorsements. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=727.28s)]
*  He's also perhaps the best liked politician or former politician out there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=730.0s)]
*  And he has constituencies. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=736.68s)]
*  And one of those constituencies is younger black man who has been a focus of his work. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=738.36s)]
*  And that's also a big weak spot for Kamala Harris. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=747.12s)]
*  If there's one place among African-American voters where she needs help, it's there. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=750.8s)]
*  Blacks are a big weak spot. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=756.12s)]
*  Not to mention white dudes, unions, Hispanics, millennials. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=758.88s)]
*  Harris is underperforming in every demographic compared to Joe. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=763.12s)]
*  This is all hands on deck. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=768.5200000000001s)]
*  Obama is even cutting ads for Senate candidates now. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  Michigan, this is Barack Obama. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  I want to talk with you about the Alyssa Slotkin I know. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=776.5200000000001s)]
*  She'll get the job done. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  And she will make you proud. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=782.48s)]
*  What? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=785.84s)]
*  How embarrassing to be used like this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=788.64s)]
*  You're the former president of the United States. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=790.6s)]
*  Oh, here's a woman you've never heard of. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=793.52s)]
*  Vote for her. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=796.4s)]
*  Does Obama have anything else to do? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=798.32s)]
*  Go live your life. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=800.88s)]
*  Politics isn't everything, man. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=802.08s)]
*  Obama had to take over this campaign because there's no sugar left in the sugar high. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=804.76s)]
*  She peaked. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=810.4000000000001s)]
*  And Democrats, including Barack, are, quote, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=811.88s)]
*  concerned that she's acting like she's sitting on a lead in a tied race. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  That's according to NBC. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  Democrats say they're trying to keep her away. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=820.88s)]
*  It's like seeing your favorite Hollywood actor. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=823.5999999999999s)]
*  And then they're on a talk show, and they can't even speak. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=826.24s)]
*  Look, what just happened in Michigan? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=829.92s)]
*  It looks like her teleprompter went down. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  Did you all see Magic Johnson? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=835.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=836.88s)]
*  Yes! [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=837.68s)]
*  Remember his number? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=840.6800000000001s)]
*  32. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  Today we got 32 days until the election. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=844.08s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  So 32 days. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=854.88s)]
*  32 days. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=858.0s)]
*  OK, we got some business to do. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=860.24s)]
*  We got some business to do. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=861.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  32 days. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  And we know we will do it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=867.32s)]
*  32 days. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=871.96s)]
*  Kamala went on a podcast with two NBA players, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=873.24s)]
*  and they had to run every single topic by the campaign. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  We gave her a skeleton and outline of the direction the conversation wanted to go. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=880.5200000000001s)]
*  And then literally we were making up questions right up until we left in the car [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=884.72s)]
*  to go see her. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=888.7600000000001s)]
*  Democrats are trying to script the Harris campaign like a movie. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=890.36s)]
*  Obama is the director. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  And when the lights are on and the cameras are rolling, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=896.04s)]
*  Biden just storms the stage like he's Will Smith. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=898.48s)]
*  Barack thought he had the last laugh with the coup, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=902.0s)]
*  but everyone knows nobody Fs with a Biden. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=904.24s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight recovery efforts, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=908.32s)]
*  they continue in parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=910.68s)]
*  Tennessee, Virginia, and Florida. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=914.24s)]
*  We have communities all across Appalachia. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=916.44s)]
*  They are completely devastated. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=919.24s)]
*  The situation tonight is dire. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=921.72s)]
*  And according to reports on the ground, the Biden administration, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=924.08s)]
*  they have been making it worse and they have been totally tone deaf for over a week. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  This has been the worst federal hurricane response in the history of our country. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  On X, Elon Musk, who's been extremely generous and helpful to people [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=937.44s)]
*  in terms of restoring communications, he said, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=942.24s)]
*  FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=944.96s)]
*  but they're actively blocking citizens who do try to help. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  He detailed the claim from a SpaceX engineer on the ground [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=952.92s)]
*  who's accusing FEMA of blocking shipments of Elon's emergency Starlink terminals, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=957.16s)]
*  which Donald Trump asked him to send and he generously sent. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=963.92s)]
*  This is soulless. It is unconscionable. It is unforgivable. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=968.04s)]
*  But in a statement, FEMA just frankly outright denied the allegation [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=971.92s)]
*  and promoted their coordination with Starlink during various natural disasters. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=976.64s)]
*  Well, apparently the message didn't get to the owner of Starlink [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=981.48s)]
*  because that name is Elon Musk. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=984.2s)]
*  And meanwhile, in a letter issued to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=986.24s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida details claims from government whistleblowers [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=990.96s)]
*  that, quote, FEMA has wasted taxpayer funds, misappropriated funds, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=995.36s)]
*  left other federal, state and local responders without deployment orders on the ground. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1000.2800000000001s)]
*  The letter continues, quote, hundreds, if not thousands of service members [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1005.7600000000001s)]
*  were deployed by the Department of Defense to North Carolina, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1010.24s)]
*  and they have sat idle waiting for FEMA. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1013.36s)]
*  We have confirmed FEMA employees deployed on the clock, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  awaiting orders are in hotels when people may, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  their very lives may be at risk even a week plus later. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1025.24s)]
*  Now, FEMA pre-disaster aid was withheld, exacerbating the emergency, it goes on. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1029.92s)]
*  It has been a full week plus already. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't forget, we only found out yesterday, a week after the hurricane, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1039.32s)]
*  that according to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, he said it, he came out with the truth. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1044.2s)]
*  I don't know where it came from, a miracle, that FEMA is almost out of money [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1049.04s)]
*  and has been slow to distribute hurricane relief funds, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1054.56s)]
*  even though it's been a very slow hurricane season. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1057.9199999999998s)]
*  And now we know the reason why, which every American should be infuriated about. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1061.56s)]
*  Biden and Harris rated FEMA's budget, they spent a billion plus dollars on housing, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1066.68s)]
*  food, education, healthcare, sex change operations, debit cards, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1072.16s)]
*  expensive hotels all over the country for Harris and Joe Biden's [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1078.2800000000002s)]
*  11.5 million plus unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  Many coming from countries with terror ties, many from our top geopolitical foes, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1087.5200000000002s)]
*  and we know there are known terrorists in this country. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1092.3600000000001s)]
*  We know that dozens of Americans have been murdered by their unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1095.6s)]
*  Dozens have been raped, even children. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1100.24s)]
*  We know that there are hundreds of victims of violent crime [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1102.6s)]
*  by Harris-Biden unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  We know all of that is true and it's cost this country billions [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  and we don't have money for the people of North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1113.3999999999999s)]
*  South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  Here's the cold hard truth. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  Biden and Harris have prioritized their obsession of illegal immigrants [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  over all of you, the American people, all the people in North Carolina, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1128.6799999999998s)]
*  South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1133.56s)]
*  They've gotten almost nothing. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1136.24s)]
*  So far a one-time $750 payment, although they've only distributed [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1137.9599999999998s)]
*  about four million of that as of yesterday and a promise, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1143.24s)]
*  maybe more money down the road if FEMA can find the cash, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1147.24s)]
*  which they don't have as of now because they gave it away [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1150.92s)]
*  to Harris-Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1153.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala totally tone deaf. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1156.2s)]
*  Even a Hollywood fundraiser took precedence over hurricane victims. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1158.96s)]
*  Joe sat at his backside on a beach chair. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1162.4s)]
*  This is why it's Kamala's Katrina. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1165.76s)]
*  She's the borders are. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1167.8000000000002s)]
*  That money came from FEMA, went right to her illegal immigrants [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1169.16s)]
*  that she said weren't here, that the border is secure [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1173.0s)]
*  and the border is closed. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1176.5600000000002s)]
*  The president, well, he's totally checked out. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1178.28s)]
*  You don't believe me? You decide. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1180.84s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1183.76s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone, what do they need, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1186.52s)]
*  after what you saw today? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1189.56s)]
*  Oh, in the storm zone? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1192.52s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1193.68s)]
*  I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1194.68s)]
*  They're getting everything they need. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1198.08s)]
*  And they're very happy across the board. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1200.0s)]
*  What storm zone? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1204.32s)]
*  They've got everything they need? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1205.8s)]
*  They need? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1207.56s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1208.72s)]
*  We're now more than eight days after the hurricane made landfall. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1210.24s)]
*  Victims in all of these states are not getting anything near what they need. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1214.68s)]
*  We still haven't found all the people that are in need. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1219.6s)]
*  Joe Biden has no clue what he's talking about. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1222.96s)]
*  Kamala is checked out. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1226.24s)]
*  She's just happy her illegal immigrants are being taken care of. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1227.68s)]
*  Got to make sure they get their money for their sex change operations. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1231.64s)]
*  And now the president is at the White House. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1235.04s)]
*  And earlier today, laughing it up. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1236.92s)]
*  You know, just having a good old time with the press corps. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1239.1599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1243.0s)]
*  Do you reconsider dropping out of the race? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1244.52s)]
*  I'm back in. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1247.84s)]
*  Now, many Americans are still without power across huge areas of Appalachia. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  No internet, no self-service. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1257.6399999999999s)]
*  If they do have internet and self-service, you can thank Elon Musk, not them. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  In other words, those that have a way to communicate, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1264.12s)]
*  it's not because of any help of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1266.6s)]
*  Remember, they revoked Elon Musk's winning bid to install Starlink service [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1270.12s)]
*  to the area a year ago. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1274.9599999999998s)]
*  It would have provided that service for almost a million people. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1276.6s)]
*  Clean water, that's also in short supply. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1280.4399999999998s)]
*  Critical infrastructure has been wiped out, washed away. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1283.52s)]
*  Roads, highways, bridges destroyed. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1287.08s)]
*  Entire communities cut off from all civilization. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1290.28s)]
*  We still have no idea. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  We don't know how many people may desperately be waiting to be rescued. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1296.2s)]
*  And Joe Biden is in D.C. telling us everybody's getting all the help they need [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1301.28s)]
*  after last weekend staying on the beach all weekend. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1306.04s)]
*  And now he's yucking it up with his friends in the media mob. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1309.76s)]
*  Our very own Sarah Carter on the ground in western North Carolina. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  And what she's witnessing is absolutely gut wrenching. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1317.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1320.8s)]
*  There's just no words. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1321.96s)]
*  I don't think people can even understand what this is like [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1322.96s)]
*  unless they walk through your community to see this. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1325.5600000000002s)]
*  I never would have imagined. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1329.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm from the Gulf Coast and I've been through a lot of hurricanes [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1331.96s)]
*  but nothing like this. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1335.92s)]
*  You've never seen it like this? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1337.0s)]
*  No. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1338.28s)]
*  What about FEMA? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1340.24s)]
*  FEMA? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1341.76s)]
*  I haven't seen FEMA. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1342.68s)]
*  I don't know anything about FEMA as far as them coming around. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1344.16s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever had to experience anything like this. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know what protocol is. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1351.12s)]
*  So I'm just being patient and waiting. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1353.36s)]
*  I have heard rumors that they are around but I haven't seen anybody [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1356.04s)]
*  and we're right here in the middle of ground zero. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1360.28s)]
*  So, and we've been here every day. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's not that we've missed them. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  We just missed them. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1367.1599999999999s)]
*  It's just been amazing that it's been a real community effort. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1369.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1371.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like I tell you, it just brings me to tears to see people shipping like this. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  Right now, the New York Post and some others have reported that basically FEMA, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1378.32s)]
*  FEMA has allocated $1.4 billion. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1384.12s)]
*  But that money was allocated for illegal migraine crisis. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  Not for hurricanes, not for natural disasters, for the illegal migration crisis. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1392.76s)]
*  When you hear that as a taxpayer, what goes through your mind? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  Anger. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1403.04s)]
*  You should look out for your people that are helping you run this country. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1405.0s)]
*  We just need help. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1408.16s)]
*  We need FEMA. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1409.28s)]
*  We need somebody to start rolling in with some dollars. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1410.1200000000001s)]
*  Man, it's just dire. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1414.0s)]
*  You know, you told me earlier, you've never asked for a dollar in your life from anyone. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1417.72s)]
*  But this is one of those times where the American public, just like your neighbors, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1422.44s)]
*  might have to pick up the slack and to help your community get out of this, right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yeah, we will. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1434.68s)]
*  We'll have to. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1435.64s)]
*  We don't have a choice. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1436.3600000000001s)]
*  I may not be able to open my business back up again. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1438.8400000000001s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1445.04s)]
*  I'm telling people that I am because I want to give hope. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1446.3200000000002s)]
*  But if I can't, then I'll have plenty of idle time to help. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1449.88s)]
*  Maybe it's time that Joe and Kamala Katrina Harris head back south and go to the southeast [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1458.0s)]
*  and take another look and get to work. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1465.24s)]
*  Or maybe FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, designed to help Americans in emergency [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1467.08s)]
*  situations. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe they should be focused on emergency management, not illegal immigration, not on [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1475.8s)]
*  DEI and equity, which is a big part of their, quote, mission in writing. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1481.72s)]
*  If you look at FEMA's strategic plan, instilling equity is the number one goal stated in the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1486.72s)]
*  agency's official strategic plan. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1492.6000000000001s)]
*  What is equity doing right now to save lives in North Carolina and Georgia? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1496.92s)]
*  What is it doing? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1501.08s)]
*  What is equity doing to rebuild roads and bridges and give people food and water and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1502.08s)]
*  shelter? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1507.0s)]
*  What is equity doing to get people the things that they need, the time, the energy, the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1508.0s)]
*  taxpayer money that FEMA wasted on left-wing political obsessions is an absolute disgrace. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1512.64s)]
*  Taking money for Americans and giving it to their illegal immigrants that they are obsessed [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1519.76s)]
*  with, it is unconscionable. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1525.2s)]
*  It is soulless. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1527.2s)]
*  It is heartless. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1528.6200000000001s)]
*  It's no wonder the response has been an utter disaster. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1530.0s)]
*  And today, while Kamala campaigned in Michigan, Donald Trump, he was back on the ground. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  He was touring the hurricane damage in Georgia with Governor Brian Kemp, who said that he [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1538.72s)]
*  had to go back to the federal government three times. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  He wanted 90 counties declared a disaster area. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1546.8s)]
*  He got 11. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1550.2s)]
*  Then he went back. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1551.2s)]
*  Then they gave him 30. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1552.2s)]
*  And you know, I think finally they stepped up today after he had to make multiple calls [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1553.8s)]
*  to get the help he needed. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1559.52s)]
*  Let me first of all, just say thank you so much for joining us as we continue to work [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1560.52s)]
*  day and night to recover from this historic but also horrific storm. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1564.84s)]
*  I want to thank you for keeping the nation's attention on those who are hurting in Georgia. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1570.12s)]
*  And I certainly appreciate President Trump helping us do that as well. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1575.2s)]
*  Brian, thank you very much. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1579.2s)]
*  Your governor is doing a fantastic job, I will tell you that. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1580.72s)]
*  And we're all with him and with everybody. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1584.0s)]
*  We've just met a group of really wonderful patriots that are working very hard. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1587.72s)]
*  They've done it before, but they told me they've never seen one like this. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1592.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not thinking about voters right now. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1595.52s)]
*  I'm thinking about lives. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1597.04s)]
*  And to be honest, it's much bigger than anything else. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1598.6s)]
*  But we're thinking about lives, a lot of lives lost, a lot of people missing. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1602.8s)]
*  And that's what I'd be focused on right now. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1606.9599999999998s)]
*  Now, there's a famous saying that a big part of success is just showing up. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1609.12s)]
*  But tonight, Kamala, Joe, they're nowhere to be found. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1613.24s)]
*  And sadly, this isn't the only crisis that is festering under Biden and Harris. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1615.98s)]
*  The Middle East is on the verge of an all-out war. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1621.2s)]
*  Our closest ally, Israel, in the region, attacked by Iran with a barrage of intercontinental [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1624.4s)]
*  ballistic missiles. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1631.2s)]
*  And it's only a matter of time, by the way, before Israel must respond. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1632.56s)]
*  And of course, then comes the pressure from Joe and Kamala to appease the Iranians. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1636.64s)]
*  They were the ones that made Iran rich. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1641.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala is also facing a personal scandal tonight, breaking this week a new [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1643.64s)]
*  Daily Mail report outlining shocking allegations against Kamala's husband, the second gentleman, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1649.0s)]
*  Dougie. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1655.72s)]
*  According to the report, he is accused of forcefully slapping his ex-girlfriend in 2012 [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1656.72s)]
*  for flirting with another man while at the Cannes Film Festival event in France. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1662.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, we've not independently verified the claims allegedly made by three of the women's [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1667.6s)]
*  friends to the Daily Mail. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1672.4399999999998s)]
*  And the outlet also never spoke with the alleged victim. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1674.76s)]
*  Well, Doug Emhoff's representative gave a statement for Semaphore denying all allegations. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1678.1599999999999s)]
*  We also reached out for a statement and have not heard back. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1685.6s)]
*  We will continue to monitor that story. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1688.48s)]
*  Now, this allegation comes after he was forced to admit that he impregnated his kid's teacher [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  while married to his first wife. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1696.9199999999998s)]
*  OK, if it was a Trump allegation, you'd think the media would be all over it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1699.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1704.4399999999998s)]
