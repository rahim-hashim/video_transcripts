# Why did many of America's major polling organizations get the election wrong?
**Fox News:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg)
*  We now turn and take a closer look at how so many of America's major polling organizations got it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=0.0s)]
*  wrong so often. Remember Des Moines, Iowa Stateâ€”the Des Moines Register state poll? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=7.68s)]
*  Yeah, they were off by 16 points in Kamala's favor. Oh, it was being touted as, oh, she's one [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  of the most trusted pollsters. NPR, Marist, had Kamala winning the popular vote by four points. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  A seven-point failure. Marist showing Kamala winning by two in Pennsylvania. A four-point [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=29.92s)]
*  spread. Kamala's favor. Frankly, most polling companies should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  They got it wrong again. Two guys that got it right in 16 and 20 and 2024 were our pollsters, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=42.0s)]
*  Matt Towery and Robert Cahaly. Take a look at your screen. Matt Towery, insider advantage, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=50.88s)]
*  deadly accurate. A polling difference of around one point or less in five key battleground states. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=55.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Robert Cahaly, Trafalgar, was also spot on. Four battleground states off by a single [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  point or less. Well done. Robert Cahaly, Matt Towery, join us now with more. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Matt, you guys got it right three times in a row, the presidential race. Everybody was kind of off [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=75.68s)]
*  in 2022, but it was post-COVID, post-Roe v. Wade. It was kind of a hard year to poll. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=80.72s)]
*  But you got the last three presidential elections dead on accurate. And I remember Nate Silver, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=86.8s)]
*  and we put it up the last time you were on, actually appraised you guys, but he doesn't [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=94.0s)]
*  mention you guys anymore. Why is that? Well, first of all, Hannity, I've known you since 1992. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=98.32s)]
*  And I want to thank you for sticking with me and with Robert. Not only are you a dear friend, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=106.88s)]
*  but we've been a great colleague through all this stuff. But we've been treated like the garbageman [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=111.52s)]
*  of pollsters. When they write about the polling from these various expert groups, they say, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=117.44s)]
*  the quality New York Times poll, the quality Anselzer poll, we're never considered the quality. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Decision desks won't use our polling because it's not up to their standards. Well, guess what? Three [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=129.6s)]
*  times in a row, we've gotten this thing closer than anybody else. And Robert has done a fantastic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=134.56s)]
*  job. But the one thing I want to mention is we caught the turnaround in this race after the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=139.36s)]
*  second assassination attempt of Donald Trump. And that was never noted by anyone. We talked about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=145.6s)]
*  it on your show over and over again. That's when the turnaround started. And so I read today, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=151.68s)]
*  nobody got the trend right that Trump was going to win. We started talking about that trend [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  a month and a half ago. And so it wasn't hard to see. Now it's hard to poll. And I think Nate said [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=161.12s)]
*  we were herders because we were all sticking to like one or two points. Well, Pennsylvania was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=166.88s)]
*  basically one, one and a half points. So if you're right, you're right. But we knew who was going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  win. And we said, we told it to your own viewers just the other night. We told them where we thought [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=176.56s)]
*  this race was headed. And Robert did a fantastic job. Robert, what's your take on it? Well, I mean, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=181.28s)]
*  the first thing I'm still trying to find these hidden Kamala voters. I don't, I don't know where [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=189.12s)]
*  they are or maybe they're confused about where the polls are. Maybe they say, by the way, Matt, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=193.44s)]
*  Matt's going to be looking for a golf ball at a very famous golf course soon and you're not going [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=199.52s)]
*  to be able to find it. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Robert, go ahead. The fact is, no, the fact is, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=203.68s)]
*  this, this, you know, they have all this polling orthodoxy and they're, they're little clubs and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=215.12s)]
*  all the little groups and, and there's no accountability. And the fact is nothing is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=220.32s)]
*  going to change. They're going to still call these the quality pollsters. They're going to still [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=225.12s)]
*  do everything different because I've always seen you, they're, a poll has one of two purposes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  It is designed to reflect the electorate or it is designed to affect the electorate. And you look at [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=234.72s)]
*  what that Anseltra poll did at the last minute. It gave the whole country, all the Trump people, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=241.52s)]
*  heartburn. It gave all the, the, the other side, they got so excited. And I mean, even the, the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  prognosticators did a tick up for Harris in the last day. It was all nonsense based on something [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=252.8s)]
*  else. That was not reflecting the electorate. That was designed to affect it. And until they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=259.36s)]
*  outed for this, their error rates prove they're wrong and prove their purpose. Error rate is how [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=264.64s)]
*  we're judged and they will fail. I want to thank you both. Congratulate you both. That is three [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=270.96s)]
*  presidential elections in a row. Maybe Nate Silver should do an article about Matt Towery, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  insider advantage, Trafalgar, Robert Cahaly. We're right again. Don't hold your breath though, guys. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  I wish Matt, I wish you the best of luck. Robert, I wish you the best of luck finding the hidden [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=289.52s)]
*  Kamala voters and Matt, good luck finding that golf ball. Or maybe the third or fourth one. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=294.96s)]
*  Thanks, Hannity. You really helped me out on that one. You might have to go swimming for it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwutNQqrMIg&t=302.08s)]
