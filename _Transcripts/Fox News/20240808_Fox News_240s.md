# Vivek Ramaswamy: Walz tells us which wing of Kamala's party she bends the knee to
**Fox News:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s)
*  Joining us now, former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, Vivek, let's get your take. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=4.4s)]
*  Greatest contributor to the Democratic Party is the media. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=7.28s)]
*  We have Kamala and Tim in their own words. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=10.68s)]
*  It is the most radicalâ€”the most radical candidates to ever run on a major party ticket [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=12.76s)]
*  for the presidency and the vice presidency in this country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=20.56s)]
*  And yet they go completely unvetted. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=23.6s)]
*  They have a media that is compliant and extension of their press office. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=25.84s)]
*  What is your reaction to it and how does the Trump campaign deal with that challenge? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=29.28s)]
*  It's a challenge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=33.2s)]
*  Look, part of this, Sean, is the consequence of the fact they laid a trap for us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=34.2s)]
*  And the trap was this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=39.68s)]
*  Joe Biden was the nominee such that for the last 18 months, Republicans have focused our [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=41.08s)]
*  financial and political capital on tacking Joe Biden when he's not the nominee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=45.44s)]
*  But because the press is the one that criticized Biden in that last month, here's what they've [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=50.16s)]
*  done. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=53.92s)]
*  They've banked some artificial credibility with the public. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=54.92s)]
*  I've talked to many independents across the country and their main pushback on the idea [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  that the media is biased is the fact that, no, no, no, they were just criticizing Biden [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=61.44s)]
*  as recently as last month. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=65.64s)]
*  So in some ways, we were led into that trap and now it's up to us to find our way out [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=72.2s)]
*  Here's that path, Sean. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=73.2s)]
*  I think that we would make the same mistake again by just obsessing over the candidates [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=74.28s)]
*  instead of following a three-word formula to win this election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=78.28s)]
*  Focus on policy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=82.84s)]
*  Focus on our own vision for this country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=84.74s)]
*  What do we actually stand for? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=86.9s)]
*  That makes the other side irrelevant by comparison. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  That's our only chance at success and I think it is going to be our winning path to success. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  But we got to learn from our mistake last time around to correct it this time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  See, I think if you, this election comes about their radical extremism on immigration, on [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  law and order or the lack thereof and defund, dismantle, no bail. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  If it becomes about no fracking and no drilling and energy, if it becomes about their economy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  and their economic policies and their New Green Deal desire and a 70 to 80 percent tax [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=115.98s)]
*  rate and taxes on unrealized capital gains, small business and corporations which don't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=120.5s)]
*  pay taxes and about America's role in the world, it's a slam dunk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=126.86s)]
*  They can't win. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=132.14s)]
*  But getting, bypassing this almost impenetrable wall of the media is hard. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=133.94s)]
*  They're corrupt. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=139.98s)]
*  Of course it's hard. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=140.98s)]
*  But you know what, we're running to save a country here, Sean, so that work is cut [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=142.8s)]
*  out for us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=146.44s)]
*  The question is whether we rise to the challenge. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=147.44s)]
*  Seal the border, grow the economy, fight rampant crime in this country and stay out of World [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=149.68s)]
*  War III. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=154.12s)]
*  If this election comes down to those four things, we win this handily. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=155.12s)]
*  If it doesn't, we lose this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  I think those are our two choices. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=160.06s)]
*  The reality is the voting public's not going to be voting for Tim Walz. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=162.36s)]
*  I think this news cycle is going to go away regardless in another week. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  But what does Walz's selection actually tell us? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=168.86s)]
*  It teaches us about Kamala Harris and how she'll make decisions as a U.S. president [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=171.0s)]
*  and to which wing of her party she actually bends the knee. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=176.36s)]
*  And so this has opened up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=180.48s)]
*  This has been exactly what we needed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=181.68s)]
*  It has given us the reset we needed in this race to refocus on policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=183.36s)]
*  They've served this up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=187.96s)]
*  I think it was a great gift making Walz the vice presidential nominee. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=188.96s)]
*  Having given us that gift, now it's up to us to receive it and use that to actually [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=192.44s)]
*  offering competing visions for the future policy governing the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=196.84s)]
*  If we do that, we're successful. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=201.16s)]
*  But that's up to us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  I have five issues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  You have four. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=205.8s)]
*  I would dial in on how they plan to save the country, make America great again, to steal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=206.8s)]
*  a phrase, and also pointing out their radicalism in their own words. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=211.28s)]
*  And somehow there's got to be an effort to bypass what is the extension of their press [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=215.74s)]
*  offices with the media. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=222.56s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=224.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=225.56s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=226.56s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GDPa6u_8s&t=227.56s)]
