# House Democrats are obstructing the Hunter probe, says Comer
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8)
*  Joining us now to respond, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and House Ways [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=0.0s)]
*  and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=4.34s)]
*  Gentlemen, welcome back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=6.22s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=7.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=8.22s)]
*  Jason, let me start with you tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=9.22s)]
*  And you brought the whistleblowers back in, and we learned an awful lot in the last 24 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=16.02s)]
*  hours. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  Can you bring everybody up to speed? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, Sean. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=24.62s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=25.62s)]
*  We had a seven-hour hearing, and the whistleblowers provided over 56 pages of new documentation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=27.3s)]
*  President Biden has said that he has not known anything about his son, Hunter Biden's, business [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=34.74s)]
*  dealings. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=40.42s)]
*  Well, we have 327 emails that prove otherwise. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=41.42s)]
*  In fact, 54 emails came from President Biden and his fake alias accounts to Hunter Biden's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  business associate, Eric Schwerin, who was the architect of all of these shell corporations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  that Hunter Biden used to pass millions of dollars through foreign entities and then [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  to a lot of his family members. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=67.6s)]
*  Let's talk about what are in these emails and how does it specifically implicate the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=70.24s)]
*  president himself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=74.58s)]
*  I mean, we know Hunter says that he gave half his income to Pops. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=75.58s)]
*  We know he complained bitterly about paying for Pops' home repairs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=79.66s)]
*  We know that 10 percent was set aside from the big guy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=83.92s)]
*  And we also know the bribery statute does not mandate that if he as vice president takes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=88.88s)]
*  an action that benefits somebody and his family, that would be bribery by law, wouldn't it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  It would be. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=99.52s)]
*  One of the emails that the whistleblowers uncovered was an email from Kevin Morris to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=100.7s)]
*  the tax preparer of Hunter Biden's that said that they needed to take care of Hunter [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=108.12s)]
*  Biden's tax problems, which was about $2 million at that time, and said if they didn't, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=114.72s)]
*  they would be facing great personal and political risk. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=122.64s)]
*  The political risk of that, Sean, was the fact that it was three weeks before Super [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=125.78s)]
*  Tuesday in February of 2020. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=130.68s)]
*  That political risk was the election of Joe Biden. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=135.0s)]
*  All right, let me ask you, James Comer, both you and Jim Jordan on Judiciary have now threatened [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=138.44s)]
*  to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress, and I believe that includes Joe's brother [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=144.2s)]
*  James Biden, if they fail to show up after the subpoena that you sent them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=148.32s)]
*  What actions will you take? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=154.52s)]
*  Well, we'll hold them in contempt. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=155.52s)]
*  I mean, we've issued lawful subpoenas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=157.72s)]
*  I'm hopeful they'll both show up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=160.6s)]
*  I have more confidence that Jim Biden's going to show up than I do Hunter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=162.64s)]
*  You're seeing today rhetoric from the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee openly encouraging [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  Hunter Biden not to show up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=172.44s)]
*  I mean, the Democrats have, the Democrats on the Oversight Committee have obstructed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  this credible investigation just as much as the Biden legal team, just as much as the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=179.0s)]
*  mainstream media and all these government agencies who are supposed to be investigating. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  We're going to hold Hunter Biden accountable if he doesn't show up for the subpoena. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=189.0s)]
*  Sean, we looked and Donald Trump's immediate family testified in depositions on the January [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=193.2s)]
*  6th committee for 18 hours, 18 hours. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=200.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's family showed up for depositions when they were subpoenaed by the January 6th [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=205.56s)]
*  committee, but the Bidens think they're, you know, the vile doesn't apply to them, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=210.0s)]
*  that they're special and they aren't going to show up. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=214.4s)]
*  I mean, there's more evidence now about Hunter Biden than most criminals that have to show [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=217.0s)]
*  up for depositions in big time legal cases. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=223.64s)]
*  So he's going to be there or we're going to hold him accountable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=227.04s)]
*  Exit question for both of you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=230.8s)]
*  Jason Smith, do you believe that your committee and Chairman Comer's committee and Chairman [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=232.04s)]
*  Jordan's committee have now accumulated enough evidence that at least on a prime official [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=237.8s)]
*  level, a case can be made that Joe Biden was involved in bribery as vice president, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=243.08s)]
*  that he took a specific official action in exchange for a benefit financially for his family? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  We have over 1100 pages of documentation that came from the two IRS whistleblowers that came [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=255.24s)]
*  before the Ways and Means Committee. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  There's numerous examples in those 1100 pages that show that, in fact, Joe Biden had had [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  helped his son in a lot of business dealings. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=272.92s)]
*  In fact, from the sense of, I believe that they've used Air Force Two more like a corporate jet, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=277.16s)]
*  flying his son to Ukraine and Mexico. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=284.6s)]
*  It's quite disturbing of the official acts that the whistleblowers have tied in to instances [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=288.76s)]
*  of official conduct. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  And your same question, James Comer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=297.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=300.76s)]
*  Look, we had the FBI 1023 form that alleged bribery, but yet the FBI refused to investigate [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=301.24s)]
*  it. Now we find there were more informants that accused the Bidens of accepting bribes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=307.08s)]
*  And you look at what happened with Burisma, with firing the prosecutor, Shokin, who was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=312.12s)]
*  investigating Burisma. That was a quid pro quo. Remember, the Democrats impeached Donald Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  for asking about Joe Biden's quid pro quo. Joe Biden committed the ultimate quid pro quo with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=321.56s)]
*  our tax dollars, leveraging a billion dollars of tax dollars to get a prosecutor fired who [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=329.24s)]
*  was investigating his son. And then you look at what he's done with China. We believe he's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=334.6s)]
*  compromised because of the millions of dollars he's taken from China. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=338.36s)]
*  And his son continued to get paid, didn't he? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=341.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=343.24s)]
*  All right. Thank you both, Chairman Comer and Chairman Smith. We appreciate it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=343.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpXaLrDSFO8&t=359.24s)]
