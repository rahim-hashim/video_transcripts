# Mark Levin: We need to 'try like hell' to get to the Supreme Court
**Fox News:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA)
*  Moral reaction, the great one, Mark Levin, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Great one. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=2.4s)]
*  I know you have a lot to say. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=2.96s)]
*  We don't have as much time as usual. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=4.08s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=8.84s)]
*  No crime, no jurisdiction, no due process. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=9.56s)]
*  Conflicted judge, Soros prosecutor, Manhattan jury. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=13.4s)]
*  You know, I'm going to tell you something, Sean. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=17.76s)]
*  I've spent most of my legal career, not as a former federal prosecutor, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=20.1s)]
*  although I served as a chief of staff to an attorney general. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=23.88s)]
*  I've spent most of my legal career fighting these people, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=27.08s)]
*  suing the federal government, the DOJ, the IRS, the Treasury Department, the EPA, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=30.68s)]
*  suing campaigns, fighting over voting rights laws, and so forth. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=36.68s)]
*  And one thing I don't think our audience understands, and you need to understand. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=40.04s)]
*  We have too many lawyers who are risk averse, too many lawyers who will whine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=46.2s)]
*  and complain, I have spent 40 years sitting down with people who put on legal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=50.32s)]
*  brass knuckles and take these bastards on in court. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=55.48s)]
*  I'm at the appellate and supreme court level. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=59.12s)]
*  That's where my focus has been my entire career. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=62.0s)]
*  So what they need to do now, in my view, is to go up the appellate chain in New [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=65.24s)]
*  York. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=69.72s)]
*  We need to stop whining about how long that's going to take. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Seek any emergency, immediate appeal that you possibly can. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=73.4s)]
*  That's one lane. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=77.6s)]
*  And the other lane is to try like hell to get to the supreme court. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=78.88s)]
*  People say, well, they're not going to take it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=82.44s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  If George Patton was said, I don't think I can get to the battle of the bulge in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=85.56s)]
*  time, we would have lost World War II. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=90.48s)]
*  I am sick and tired of these legal defeatists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=92.2s)]
*  We need to stop whining, stop complaining. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=95.04s)]
*  We know what the hell we're up against. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  It's not news. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=99.56s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=101.2s)]
*  We got to fight these people with our smarts. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=102.56s)]
*  We have to take some risks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=104.76s)]
*  We need to push the edge of the envelope. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't mean in a way that kooks do it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=108.28s)]
*  We need to look at Bush versus Gore. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=110.92s)]
*  Why did the Supreme Court take that case? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=112.6s)]
*  From the Florida Supreme Court. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=114.8s)]
*  We need to look at things like common law writs, which I know the audience [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=116.8s)]
*  don't understand, but a lot of lawyers do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  Not writs of certiari based on statute, but common law writs based on judicial [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=123.36s)]
*  decisions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  We need to give the Supreme Court the opportunity to fix this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=133.48s)]
*  We cannot have local acting judges, Soros DAs, 15,000 district attorneys [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=134.44s)]
*  office, God knows how many state judges, destroying our federal election [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=143.44s)]
*  system, influencing how we elect the president of the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=148.16s)]
*  And if we have a pathway to bring it to the Supreme Court, even though it's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  rarely used, and by God, we use it, we use every legal quiver that we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=157.0s)]
*  possibly can muster. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=162.44s)]
*  Rather than sitting around and saying, well, it'll take three months. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=164.44s)]
*  Fine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=169.48s)]
*  Follow that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Preserve the state appellate system. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=171.24s)]
*  And as for this idea that I have a faith in the system, what is a judge? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=173.72s)]
*  He's flesh and blood. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=179.64s)]
*  He's a person. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=181.6s)]
*  He's a lawyer who happens to have a role. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=182.36s)]
*  If the judge doesn't respect the rule of law, why the hell should I respect [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=185.32s)]
*  the judge? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=189.0s)]
*  If the prosecutor doesn't respect the rule of law, why the hell should I [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=190.2s)]
*  respect the prosecutor? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=194.96s)]
*  So far, the judicial system, so far, has let down the American people, and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=196.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court needs to step up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=201.56s)]
*  This is a federal matter, a presidential matter, and it's going to get worse [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=203.8s)]
*  before it gets better. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=208.12s)]
*  This is a great book. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=211.0s)]
*  We need to dust it off. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=211.96s)]
*  Men in Black. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=213.0s)]
*  You wrote it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=213.76s)]
*  Great one, Mark Levin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=214.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2hqknhczRA&t=215.68s)]
