# Trump lawyer: This is so desperate and pathetic
**Fox News:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE)
*  Anyway, we turn now to an update from the anti-Trump law fair out of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, new efforts from D.A. Alvin Bragg to silence Donald Trump, all while allowing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=5.2s)]
*  violent anti-Semitic rioters at Columbia University to go free. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=10.96s)]
*  Here with reaction, Trump legal spokesperson Alina Haba and Harvard law professor Alan [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=15.8s)]
*  Dershowitz. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=20.84s)]
*  Alina, we got into this some last night. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=21.84s)]
*  Let's go a little bit deeper. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=23.56s)]
*  And where does this stand in terms of the Trump legal team and what you're trying to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=25.48s)]
*  do? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=32.24s)]
*  D.A. Alvin Bragg has now tried a renewed attempt to continue the gag order against [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=33.24s)]
*  President Trump, the same gag order that violates every American's First Amendment rights, let [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=39.24s)]
*  alone the candidate for president, the leading candidate for president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=44.2s)]
*  He's renewing his claims that it is necessary to maintain them, even though the trial is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=48.36s)]
*  over. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  He is stating that the reason is because once again, those very scary MAGA, Make America [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=54.4s)]
*  Great Again, Republicans in our country, the people that love our country, happen to be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  the cause of fear for a judge. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=65.5s)]
*  I get death threats, Sean, pretty much every week. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=67.96s)]
*  I don't blame the DNC. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=71.52s)]
*  I don't blame anybody that's uneducated. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=73.36s)]
*  I don't go on a tirade about it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=76.52s)]
*  I take it because I'm a public person because it's kind of what I asked for. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=79.24s)]
*  But here we've got a guy who's political and we have him using anything he can to take [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=82.68s)]
*  the constitutional rights of Americans, especially the rights of us to choose and hear the leading [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  candidate for president of the United States of America by taking away his voice. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=93.98s)]
*  It's so desperate and pathetic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  It's not enough that they can't win in court because they get overturned. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=100.72s)]
*  Now they have to silence their opponent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  It's absolute election interference. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=105.62s)]
*  Let's get your take, Professor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  I don't think the Trump legal team has any other options but what they're doing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=109.16s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=113.22s)]
*  Well, they have to appeal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=114.22s)]
*  I have a piece in tonight's Wall Street Journal in which I urge people like us file lawsuits [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=116.28s)]
*  against New York. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=123.96s)]
*  After all, we have the right to hear Donald Trump in the election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=125.32s)]
*  And this gag order says that Joe Biden can accuse Donald Trump of being a felon, having [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=129.24s)]
*  been convicted by an unfair jury, unfair judge of a non-crime. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=135.84s)]
*  He has the right to do that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=140.94s)]
*  But Donald Trump has one hand tied behind his back because he can't respond in full. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=142.62s)]
*  He can't talk about the judge's daughter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=147.86s)]
*  He can't talk about the unfairness of the jurors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=150.36s)]
*  I guess even the DA is now saying, well, maybe he can talk about the witnesses. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=153.96s)]
*  But the First Amendment applies not only to Donald Trump, the speaker, but to all of us, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=159.08s)]
*  the viewers and the listeners. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=164.28s)]
*  We have the right to hear a full and complete debate, not a partial debate in which Trump [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=166.36s)]
*  is restricted about what he can say. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=173.4s)]
*  So I hope that the gag order will be appealed by Trump's lawyers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  And I hope amicus briefs, friend of the court briefs, will be submitted by ordinary people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=180.44s)]
*  saying, look, you're depriving us of our right to hear somebody. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  We're undecided. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=190.08s)]
*  We don't know who we're going to vote for. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=191.08s)]
*  We may be influenced by this sordid and unfair conviction. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=192.56s)]
*  We want to hear the other side. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=197.82s)]
*  And that's why it's so important that the gag order be lifted at this point, not for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's sake alone, not for the Republican Party's sake, but for the sake of all Americans, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=203.2s)]
*  particularly undecided voters, who have a right to hear both sides of the issue. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=208.44s)]
*  Yeah, well said, Professor. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=214.68s)]
*  Thank you, Alina. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-4yzjHZbE&t=215.68s)]
