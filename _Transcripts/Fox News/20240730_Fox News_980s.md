# Hannity: Which Kamala do you believe?
**Fox News:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight an official segregated campaign event named white dudes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=0.0s)]
*  For Kamala Harris, it's raising eyebrows for all the wrong reasons coming up our friend [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=6.0s)]
*  Jimmy Fela will weigh in on this very unusual [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=11.0s)]
*  Zoom call with D D list Hollywood elite wannabes and a bunch of has-been politicians [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=13.8s)]
*  Also, we'll bring you highlights from today's explosive Senate hearing on the most unbelievable security breakdown during the assassination [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Attempt against President Trump. It is even worse than we originally thought [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=27.56s)]
*  But first we begin with an important message from the Harris campaign. They have kindly now requested that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=31.4s)]
*  every American [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  disregard [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=40.36s)]
*  anything and everything pretty much [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=41.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris has ever said and done and instead they want you to focus on their candidates [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=44.0s)]
*  sudden miraculous [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  election year [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  Conversions on massive major issues. He's a whole new person now apparently amazing. What a transformation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=53.04s)]
*  In fact today in Atlanta Kamala well sported a brand new southern accent very impressive [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=60.2s)]
*  I'm from I lived in Georgia for years pretty impressive. Take a look [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=66.8s)]
*  The path to the White House runs right through this state [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=70.84s)]
*  And you all helped us win in 2020 and we're gonna do it again in 2024 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=74.76s)]
*  2024 y'all pretty not bad [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=85.48s)]
*  Kamala appeared on stage with the notorious election denier Stacey Abrams herself who might still think that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=88.68s)]
*  She's a governor of Atlanta. Now, of course, nothing matters anymore in the upside-down world of Kamala Harris [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=95.0s)]
*  For example remember Kamala's recent crusade against fracking you might recall take a look [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=101.64s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=107.16s)]
*  Adding the United States the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice. There's no question. I'm in favor of banning fracking [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=112.44s)]
*  Complete ban she said it on numerous occasions on Friday [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=121.4s)]
*  However, the Harris campaign told the Hill that their candidate doesn't actually have a vote [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=124.68s)]
*  The candidate doesn't actually mean what she said many times and now does not support a fracking ban [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=130.28s)]
*  Now here's my question to you. Which Kamala do you believe? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=138.04s)]
*  I believe the one that said she wants to ban fracking and what about that single-payer medicare for all bill that she co-sponsored? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=141.96s)]
*  Cosponsored with Bernie Sanders. Remember she vowed to get rid of private health insurance. This was only a couple years ago [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=150.26s)]
*  Take a look [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=158.6s)]
*  You support the medicare for all bill. I think initially co-sponsored by senator Bernie Sanders [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=159.96s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor on it. I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=164.36s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=169.88s)]
*  They don't get to keep it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=172.52s)]
*  Well, listen the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company having them give you approval going through the paperwork [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  All of the delay that may require who of us has not had that situation where you got to wait for approval and the doctor says [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=184.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=190.92s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=194.28s)]
*  You don't need your private insurance. It's like, you know, we have the post office [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=197.88s)]
*  Anyway, this week kamala harris her campaign ad announced kamala has experienced another sudden change of heart [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=202.04s)]
*  No longer supports medicare for all or the legislation she personally co-sponsored [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=208.84s)]
*  Which kamala do you believe apparently she's also experiencing a similar change of heart when it comes to strict gun control [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=215.32s)]
*  Gun control remember not long ago kamala vowed pretty much to confiscate guns through a mandatory [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=223.56s)]
*  Buyback program mandatory would mean confiscate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=231.0s)]
*  But they'll give you a few bucks for it. Take a look [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=235.16s)]
*  What would you do about the? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=238.28s)]
*  Millions of specifically assault weapons that are already in circulation. What do you do about those? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=241.4s)]
*  Well, there are approximately five million to your point craig [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=247.16s)]
*  We have to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program. It's got to be smart [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=249.96s)]
*  We got to do it the right way [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=254.36s)]
*  Oh once again a campaign ad is walking back those comments and said kamala no longer supports a mandatory gun buyback program [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=256.92s)]
*  Look, does anyone really believe the new kamala on this issue or any of these issues? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=266.20000000000005s)]
*  And of course kamala harris has also changed her position on the border [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  She you know the single most politically vulnerable issue. She is facing take a look [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=276.12s)]
*  A lot of the signs at the rally you just held were people standing there saying abolish ice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, is that a position that you agree with? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=289.96s)]
*  Re-examine ice and its role and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing and we need to probably [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=292.9s)]
*  think about starting from scratch [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=298.76s)]
*  because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=300.76s)]
*  Um, there's a lot that is wrong with the way that is conducting itself and we need to deal with that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  She wants to abolish ice references to slavery references to the kkk [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=308.2s)]
*  But now she supports more funding for ice and border patrol agents and security [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  Albeit way too little way too late. Wait [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=320.04s)]
*  Is that the same kamala that lied for over three years saying that the border is secure? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=323.56s)]
*  Is that the same person take a look? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=329.16s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=331.88s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked congress to do is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=334.6s)]
*  The first request we made [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=341.72s)]
*  pass [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=344.36s)]
*  A bill [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  To create a pathway to citizenship the border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=348.44s)]
*  We're gonna have two million people across this border for the first time ever. You're confident this border's secure [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=354.04s)]
*  We have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=360.44s)]
*  A secure border [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=362.6s)]
*  In that that is a priority for any nation including ours in our administration [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  But there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=370.06s)]
*  Now take a look at your screen [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  These are just a few of the thousands of victims from the biden harris border disaster. Look very closely [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=377.26s)]
*  These names you've heard some of them you've heard but not many including a grandmother from virginia was killed in a fatal [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  carjacking on sunday [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=390.44s)]
*  This poor woman killed by yet another unvetted suspected joe biden kamala harris the illegal immigrant [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=392.06s)]
*  This one from el salvador [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=399.26s)]
*  Clearly as borders are kamala harris was unable unwilling to address the root causes of illegal immigration [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=401.26s)]
*  She lied for three years about it or you know [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=408.3s)]
*  She didn't do anything to secure the border certainly in any way as a result [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=411.9s)]
*  Americans continue to die every single day [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=416.44s)]
*  Thousands from fentanyl poisoning others have been murdered by violent criminal illegal aliens who should not be in our country [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=420.12s)]
*  That wouldn't be in our country if donald trump or president [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=427.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, the risk of terror continues to grow it is the biggest national security threat in our lifetime [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=430.7s)]
*  A clear and present danger now to every american and we probably have terror cells in the country [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  Because of joe and kamala and their open borders policy kamala now has to admit [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, we have been reporting the last four years and that it's all true [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=448.3s)]
*  The border is in fact not secure. It's never been secure since they've been in office [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=452.38s)]
*  But she doesn't seem to have any real plan to fix it and this brings us to our next flip-flop [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=457.98s)]
*  Because kamala's press secretary says her boss does not support defunding the police [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  At least not now but here's kamala harris on june 10th 2020 during the height of the summer of love [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=469.42s)]
*  Take a look [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=476.86s)]
*  One of the conversations that has needed to happen for a long time but is getting [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=477.98s)]
*  a sense of prominence [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  Now that is such an important conversation is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  We have to reimagine [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=488.06s)]
*  public safety in america we have to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  Redirect the resources and nick you may know this in many cities in america over one-third of their city budget is placed [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=495.0s)]
*  Is is paid to policing so it's about [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=501.82s)]
*  reimagining [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=505.16s)]
*  How you create a society in a way that everyone has as a right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=506.94s)]
*  Health right and safety but understanding it's not going to be achieved by militarizing the police [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=513.82s)]
*  My whole point is to say look [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=520.38s)]
*  It's it's it's like frankly it's passed backwards it is because what it's been is about people [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=522.78s)]
*  Confusing the concept and then putting money into budgets and requesting money to go into police budgets to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=529.96s)]
*  create safety [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=537.0s)]
*  In 2020 at the height of the 574 riots in the summer of 2020 kamala wanted [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  Americans to reimagine their safety with fewer police [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  And then she promoted that bail fund four days after they burned down that minneapolis police precinct [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=549.74s)]
*  And of course that bail fund freed violent criminals include many who had committed [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=555.98s)]
*  Hainous crimes including murder while out on bail a few years earlier during her time as california's attorney general [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=560.78s)]
*  Kamala was also very pro-criminal in fact [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=568.2199999999999s)]
*  She made it a priority to fight for taxpayer funded funded gender reassignment surgery [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=571.18s)]
*  For transgender prisoners. She was she was way ahead of her time. Take a look [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=578.62s)]
*  way back when [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=585.02s)]
*  With the power that I had [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=586.62s)]
*  I used it in a way that was about pushing forward the the the movement frankly on the agenda [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=588.86s)]
*  And so look at my record to know when I was attorney general [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=594.46s)]
*  I learned that the california department of corrections which was a client of mine that they were standing in the way [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=597.98s)]
*  of of of surgery [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=605.02s)]
*  Um for prisoners for prisoners and there was a specific case and when I learned about the case [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=607.42s)]
*  I worked behind the scenes to not only make sure that that transgender woman got [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=613.34s)]
*  The services she was deserving [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=618.06s)]
*  So it wasn't only about that case. I made sure that they changed the policy in the state of california [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=620.78s)]
*  So that every transgender [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=626.78s)]
*  Inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=629.9799999999999s)]
*  That they desired and need [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=634.62s)]
*  Now remember kamala was once proud of this radical record here. She is bragging about her progressive record as an attorney. Take a look [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=637.3399999999999s)]
*  You can talk to so-called progressive prosecutors around the nation, especially those who have been elected in the last decade [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=646.62s)]
*  And they will tell you that at one time or another they looked to what kamala harris was doing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=652.78s)]
*  As a model of what could be done. In fact, the obama justice [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=658.62s)]
*  department [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=662.36s)]
*  Designated my work years and years and years ago as a model of innovation [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=663.66s)]
*  For reform in the criminal justice system [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=668.38s)]
*  Let's be very clear. Here's what kamala is bragging about as california's ag [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=671.34s)]
*  She forced law-abiding americans to pay for gender reassignment surgery [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=676.38s)]
*  For trans felons and it gets worse during kamala's time as san francisco's da [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=681.1s)]
*  She shielded a cop killer from facing the death penalty cops turned her back on her the widow of the slain officer [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=686.86s)]
*  Told cnn that well kamala never even bothered to contact her before announcing the decision [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=694.78s)]
*  Not to seek the death penalty and meanwhile the president of san francisco's police officer union asked quote [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=700.78s)]
*  Is she sorry that this kid died or is it just a political opportunity? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=707.42s)]
*  Is this is this just an opportunity for her to double down on the fact that she's not going to pursue the death penalty? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=712.3s)]
*  now kamala's time as [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=719.9s)]
*  a da [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=721.98s)]
*  And ag was marred with many serious problems. For example, let's take a look at the case of george gauge an elderly man [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=723.18s)]
*  convicted of sexual abuse a judge found that kamala's office withheld [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=731.18s)]
*  Exculpatory material that might well prove gage's innocence [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=736.12s)]
*  But a new trial was never granted due to a technicality as kamala fought to keep gage behind bars [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=740.4599999999999s)]
*  George gage is still in prison as we speak a judge also ruled that kamala's office [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=747.18s)]
*  Failed to disclose the mishandling of evidence after a technician was caught tampering with cocaine in a crime lab [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=752.54s)]
*  More than 600 drug cases were tossed out as a result of that brilliance [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=759.42s)]
*  But kamala she doesn't want to talk about that now. She probably also doesn't want to talk about her beloved pastor [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=764.46s)]
*  Oh, you're gonna love this. We have a brand new reverend jeremiah wright his name [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=770.62s)]
*  reverend doctor amos brown [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=776.22s)]
*  Now last year on the official vice presidential instagram account kamala posted a glowing picture of the reverend [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=779.1s)]
*  With the caption quote. Well, it's always an honor to spend time with my pastor reverend [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=786.0600000000001s)]
*  Dr. Amos brown of the third baptist church of san francisco [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=791.6600000000001s)]
*  He remains a source of inspiration to me always [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=796.1400000000001s)]
*  Now this is the same pastor that told the san francisco chronicle quote. I know america [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=800.22s)]
*  America is a racist country and the very same pastor who blamed racist america for 9 11 [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=806.46s)]
*  01 only six days after we lost [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=813.5s)]
*  2,977 of our fellow americans. He said quote oh [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=818.52s)]
*  America, what did you do? What did you do two weeks ago when I stood at the world conference on racism? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=823.0s)]
*  When you wouldn't show up his comments were so disgraceful [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=829.98s)]
*  Even nancy pelosi of all people who was in attendance [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=834.16s)]
*  publicly rebuked the the pastor and the sermon and even reportedly [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  Apologized to the partner of a 9 11 victim who was in the audience that partner told the free beacon that brown sermon [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=843.58s)]
*  Represented quote the second worst day of my life [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=851.1s)]
*  Even senator then senator diane feinstein left the event the then governor gray davis left the event [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  Kamala she's embraced this pastor even more. In fact, she has echoed many of the reverend's beliefs [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  For example brown sits on the california reparations task force and as of 2019 [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=869.28s)]
*  Well, kamala harris [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=876.4s)]
*  Enthusiastically supported reparations. Take a look [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=878.16s)]
*  Should black people get reparations? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  I think there has to be some foreign reparations and we can discuss what that is. But look [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  We're looking at [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  More than 200 years of slavery [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=890.72s)]
*  We're looking at [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=893.36s)]
*  Almost a hundred years of jim crow [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=895.12s)]
*  we're looking at legalized segregation and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=897.36s)]
*  And and in fact segregation on so many levels that exist today based on race [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  And there has not been [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  Any kind of intervention done [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  Not as kamala still support reparations i'm sure a spokesperson will come out any day now and say I used to but not anymore [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=916.4799999999999s)]
*  She's still proud of that radical record as a far-left progressive [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=923.52s)]
*  Does she stand by her pastor of 25 years who believes america is a racist country filled with bad people? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=927.76s)]
*  That deserve 9 11 will anyone ask kamala any of these questions will state-run media the mob ever ask any tough questions? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  Or will she continue to hide behind staff like a coward and when kamala became the presumptive nominee? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=944.0s)]
*  well, well [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=950.88s)]
*  She according to her own pastor that blamed america for 9 11 called him to pray for her [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=952.88s)]
*  If that's not ignorant blaming america for 9 11. It sounds like he kind of needs the prayers [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=960.64s)]
*  Hotest interviews and most compelling analysis you will not get it anywhere else [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUZyq_yIu8&t=973.6s)]
