# Newt Gingrich: The left is 'confronting a terrifying reality'
**Fox News:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so)
*  So the calls for Biden to drop out, they have not stopped, but not everyone on the left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=0.0s)]
*  is on board. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=6.08s)]
*  Well, our friends at that hard-hitting news show, The View, the co-host there, well, had [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=7.08s)]
*  another meltdown over the growing anti-Biden sentiment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=11.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=15.24s)]
*  I was watching television all week, and I'm a little tired of all the Biden bashing that's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  going on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=21.46s)]
*  I'm pissed off at it, frankly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=22.46s)]
*  There's a lot of Biden bashing going on, and no calls for the sexually abusive felon to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=24.46s)]
*  step down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  Joyless is pissed off at the Biden bashing, and it got worse as co-host Whoopi Goldberg [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=31.9s)]
*  made this bizarre, pretty, well, offensive, let's say, defense of Biden. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=38.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=43.78s)]
*  I don't care if he's pooped his pants. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=45.38s)]
*  I don't care if he can't put a sentence together, show me he can't do the job, and then I'll [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=50.699999999999996s)]
*  say, OK, maybe it's time to go. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=57.94s)]
*  I have poopy days all the time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=59.81999999999999s)]
*  All the—I step in so much poo you can't even imagine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=63.22s)]
*  Now, I'm not running the world, but I don't know anybody who doesn't step in stuff at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=66.86s)]
*  some point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=76.74s)]
*  Very graphic, I'll say that, here with a reaction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=78.69999999999999s)]
*  Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich—I don't know, I just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=82.02s)]
*  never thought I'd ask you this question. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=87.82s)]
*  Would you react to that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=89.66s)]
*  Sean. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=90.66s)]
*  Sean. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=91.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=92.66s)]
*  No. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=93.66s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=94.66s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=95.66s)]
*  I told Calista what you were going to do, and she said to me, are you nuts? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=96.66s)]
*  How can you go on a show where the number one topic is Whoopi Goldberg pooping? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there has to be—and I know it's hard, but there has to be some kind of level [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  of—look, what it tells you is the left is literally faced with confronting a reality [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=108.3s)]
*  so terrifying that they're just running in circles and saying weird things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=119.38s)]
*  I mean, the truth is, as of tonight, Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=125.46s)]
*  Biden is going to keep decaying. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=132.98s)]
*  Biden will almost certainly lose the general election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=135.66s)]
*  And by January, the view is going to be in a world where Donald J. Trump is being sworn [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=138.94s)]
*  in as president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=146.06s)]
*  Now, if you're one of those folks and you're as left-wing as they are, and, frankly, on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=147.33999999999997s)]
*  a good day, they're fairly unbalanced, and now you're faced with this horrifying crisis, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=152.66s)]
*  You just witnessed the initial meltdown, but I predict, if it happens the way I think it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=159.94s)]
*  will, all fall, you'll see Biden get weaker, weaker, more embarrassing, more impossible. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=165.86s)]
*  And by the time we get to the inauguration, you're going to see the left just literally [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=174.46s)]
*  melt down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=179.86s)]
*  Some of them will be in puddles. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=181.18s)]
*  Others will be admitting themselves into mental health institutions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=183.02s)]
*  Some will be fleeing to New Zealand. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=187.24s)]
*  It'll be an amazing moment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=190.12s)]
*  You're a historian, you're a professor on top of being a former speaker. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=192.96s)]
*  From a historical vantage point, when you look at the magnitude of the cover-up, everybody [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=198.32s)]
*  around him has known this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=207.04s)]
*  Everybody in the media mob, they've all known it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=209.48s)]
*  I've spent four years showing video after video after video, even before the 2020 election. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=212.68s)]
*  Democrats, they've all known it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=220.6s)]
*  Now they're acting surprised. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=223.28s)]
*  Why the conversion? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=226.52s)]
*  Is it the polls, the panic? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=228.0s)]
*  What? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, well, two things. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  One, someday, an eager investigative reporter is going to write a brilliant book on how [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=233.84s)]
*  it happened, because it is so unimaginable that every reporter in the White House press [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=241.76s)]
*  conference, everybody who encountered him, everybody who worked with him, that there [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=250.36s)]
*  was this giant conspiracy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=254.76s)]
*  And by the way, I do think that George Stephanopoulos today, even though he didn't know that he [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=255.76s)]
*  was being taped, but the fact that he would say, after his interview, he literally does [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=261.04s)]
*  not think that Biden can be president for four more years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=266.2s)]
*  I mean, for Stephanopoulos, who worked for Bill Clinton to say that, I think tells you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=270.8s)]
*  an enormous amount about where we are. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=278.12s)]
*  But there's a second part to this, which is what happened—and Clifton and I were—happened [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=280.68s)]
*  to be in Rome, and we got up at 3 in the morning to watch this thing live, because I just—we [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=287.12s)]
*  both had this instinct that you couldn't read about it later. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=292.8s)]
*  You had to see it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=296.4s)]
*  And I have to tell you, I was just stunned. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  It never occurred to me that you would get 90 minutes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=303.16s)]
*  And I feel sad for him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=307.0s)]
*  It's like somebody's great-grandfather or grandfather who just can't function, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=308.36s)]
*  and you're watching him disintegrate. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=315.52s)]
*  And I had the same feeling in the Stephanopoulos interview. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=317.38s)]
*  Clifton said to me earlier that she thought you could see George was sad doing the interview, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=320.12s)]
*  because he knew he was going through the motions with a man who couldn't possibly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=325.8s)]
*  do the job. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=330.88s)]
*  And this is where it's going to change. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  For the last two weeks, the question has been, will he stay on the ticket? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=333.6s)]
*  And in a couple weeks from now, if it's clear that he's going to stay on the ticket, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=337.92s)]
*  the issue will be, can he really do the job for four years? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And the country will realize it's impossible. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=347.18s)]
*  It couldn't possibly work. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=349.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right, Mr. Speaker. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=352.8s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=355.16s)]
*  My apologies to Calista about the opening question and then topic of the program. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=357.6s)]
*  But it is news. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=363.88s)]
*  We've got a problem. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=364.88s)]
*  I don't make up the news. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PghFV5Iv7so&t=366.76s)]
