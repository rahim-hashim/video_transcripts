# I don't understand why people want Harrison Butker's head: Jillian Michaels
**Fox News:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA)
*  Fitness expert Jillian Michaels joins primetime. Let's start with the kicker. So they're gonna get rid of the guy and they're gonna put a female soccer player who's never kicked a single field goal in college on the I guess the last team that won the Super Bowl. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, here's the good news, Jesse, is that there was a study published in SportsMed that actually assessed the possibility for such things to happen. And in fact, football kicker was one of the sports they looked at. And men had a 16 to 22 percent advantage over women in kicking a football. So I don't I don't know how realistic that is. And more to the point, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=15.0s)]
*  as a person who probably couldn't be more different than said kicker, I'm a female businesswoman, I'm gay, I'm not religious. I really don't understand what this man said that has everybody calling for his head. Somebody tell me what I'm missing when there are literally children on a college campus down the street calling for the death of all Jews, but we're protecting their First Amendment rights. But this guy lives a little different than you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=45.0s)]
*  Has different opinions than you. And we want his life ruined. Yeah, Joe, Joe Biden tells college grads America's racist and it doesn't love you. And then this kicker says you're probably excited to have kids and maybe fall in love. And this guy's on the chopping block and Biden's he could be president again. What about this trans runner? How about the trans runner that's smoking all the women? And if you raise a stink, you're canceled. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=75.0s)]
*  I completely agree with you. I think the world has lost its mind. And that's why it's important that we have guys like you out there putting these issues front and center. I mean, that was the best answer you could have possibly given. We just need more guys like me. Jillian Michaels, you're welcome back here anytime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=105.56s)]
*  Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlTXuywLEbA&t=123.96000000000001s)]
