# Hannity: This is an obvious sign of desperation
**Fox News:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU)
*  We begin with a headline from USA Today. Quote, Biden's poll numbers are awful. America braced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=0.0s)]
*  for a Trump victory in November. In every corner of the media mob, the Democratic Party, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=7.44s)]
*  the anxiety is palpable. Even reliable blue states, they're now starting to look awfully [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=13.6s)]
*  purple. One veteran pollster telling FoxNews.com, both Minnesota and Virginia, they are clearly [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=19.28s)]
*  in play. By the way, even New Jersey, is that a possibility for Donald Trump? We saw a massive [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=26.4s)]
*  80,000 plus person crowd for a rally there just last weekend. And get this, Trump is up by double [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=33.04s)]
*  digits in the great state of Nevada. That's a state he previously lost twice. Now desperate to make up [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=40.0s)]
*  ground, Joe Biden finally agreed to debate Donald Trump. Obviously a sign of desperation, as James [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=47.28s)]
*  Carville said, nothing is working. But per usual, he's up to some pretty dirty tricks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=52.96s)]
*  The campaign has a list of demands and dictates and will only debate Trump on a liberal anti-Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=58.8s)]
*  woke network and not even consult with Trump. Kamala Harris out there, meanwhile, already agreed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=66.08s)]
*  to a vice presidential debate on CBS. Trump hasn't even picked his running mate. You see what's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=72.32s)]
*  happening here? The mob, the media, the Biden campaign, colluding to just push Trump out of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=78.16s)]
*  way in plain sight. They get to pick the venue. They get to dictate all the terms of the debate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  before the Trump campaign is even able to respond. Trump has agreed to debate. He has agreed to fake [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=90.88s)]
*  news CNN. He's agreed to ABC and he's agreed to one right here on Fox. By the way, all of this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=96.72s)]
*  hatred, all this bias, it is rooted. It is a psychotic condition. It's called hate all things [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=102.4s)]
*  Donald Trump. For example, fake news CNN quickly agreed to host the first presidential debate and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  almost immediately they announced fake Jake Tapper is going to be one of the moderators. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=117.12s)]
*  They didn't consult the Trump campaign. Oh, that's really fair. And let's be clear, fake Jake, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=122.56s)]
*  he claims he's a journalist. He is a far left partisan hack with nothing but snark, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=128.72s)]
*  contempt for most Republicans, but especially for Donald Trump. Let's show you more tape. We'll show [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=135.12s)]
*  you tape every night. Well, until they find a new moderator. He pushes the government of the United [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=141.28s)]
*  States to use its power and credibility to justify his lies. Congressman Brian Mast, a Republican from [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=146.64s)]
*  Florida who lost his legs, by the way, fighting for democracy abroad. Although I don't know what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=153.6s)]
*  is I don't know about his commitment to it here in the United States, but it's also been a time of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=158.56s)]
*  extreme divisions, many of the divisions caused and exacerbated by President Trump himself. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  We'll continue to show the nation that fake Jake is a opinionated, liberal, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=171.28s)]
*  democratic talk show host, not a journalist. Fake Jake called Trump's presidency quote, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  a nightmare. Oh, that's journalism or is that opinion? But now fake news CNN wants you all to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  believe that he's going to be fair and balanced. I've said it before. I'll say it again. Fake Jake [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=189.68s)]
*  should never be allowed to moderate a presidential debate. And Donald Trump has to have a say. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=195.44s)]
*  That's the way it's always worked historically. Trump will not only be forced to debate Joe Biden, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  but if this happens, he'd be debating Biden and an abusively biased leftist talk show host by the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=208.0s)]
*  name of fake Jake Tapper. He pretends to be the journalist. He's not. Of course, Biden needs all [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=215.2s)]
*  the help he can get. His cognitive decline is a big focal point in the election. By the way, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=220.72s)]
*  you can't have notes and you can't have a teleprompter in a debate show in case you're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=226.24s)]
*  trying to maybe sneak that into. Oh, and the networks, they're not allowed to put up on the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=230.4s)]
*  screen. Oh, these are the real facts and get in their opinion to help, you know, bolster your [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=235.12s)]
*  failing debate when they shut off Donald Trump's mic. Anyway, during a speech today from Biden [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=241.44s)]
*  in D.C., Joe didn't exactly help his cause. Take a look. Well, I'm from Delaware, so I go along with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=247.28s)]
*  Delaware State being the best HBCU. Commonly keep saying it's Howard. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=253.52s)]
*  And I'm going now, I'm going Sunday to make a speech at that other place. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=264.48s)]
*  That man's called Morehouse. Morehouse College, Joe. It's impossible to know anything with this guy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=271.04s)]
*  Did he forget the name of the historically black college university where he set to deliver the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=282.8s)]
*  commencement speech? And if he did, that's really sad, isn't it? But typical. Now, today's speech [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=289.44s)]
*  was the beginning of what the Biden campaign is calling a fresh appeal to African-American voters [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=296.48s)]
*  who are turning in droves to Donald Trump. Record numbers. But instead of addressing issues [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=302.8s)]
*  that are top concern. Oh, let's see the economy, inflation. Biden is vowing to raise taxes and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=309.12s)]
*  force Americans who did not go to college to pay off student loans enjoyed by those who racked up [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=316.64s)]
*  debt. Well, you know, with one to maybe even three degrees. Take a look. That's why my [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=323.52s)]
*  administration is taking the most significant action. That was the end of the Supreme Court [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=330.08s)]
*  tried to stop me to provide student debt relief. Most supreme ever. We raised 400 million billion [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=333.68s)]
*  dollars over the next 10 years. This investment has helped HBG use everything from Bill Student [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=341.12s)]
*  Housing to study climate science. Million billion? Help me out with that. Anyway, and of course, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=346.48s)]
*  oh, he's losing young people. I'll pay off your college loan. I hope you vote for me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  Maybe somebody in the Democratic Party should just listen to the voters. Take a look at this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=361.92s)]
*  President Biden, I really feel like he making everything harder for everybody. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=368.8s)]
*  Got everybody jump through hoops, just do extra things. He wants to make it seem as if he's for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=373.92s)]
*  the blacks and he's not really because he hasn't really helped anybody. I like Trump. Trump, what [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  he is doing. Trump has helped out a lot of people in the community, helped out a lot of black businesses [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=384.64s)]
*  and I'm voting for Trump. Even though I don't like Biden, I would much rather vote for Biden. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=390.88s)]
*  That whole tape African Americans interviewed on FoxNews.com. That continues for three and a half [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=396.96s)]
*  minutes. It's not surprising. Many African American voters detest Joe Biden. First and foremost, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=402.96s)]
*  his policies are a train wreck. Why? Inflation prices, they're up over 20%. You see what's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=408.88s)]
*  happening with unvetted Joe Biden, illegal immigrants, you know, coming from our top [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=416.88s)]
*  geopolitical foes. Yeah, they're also taking resources away from you, the American people, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=421.68s)]
*  your resources, defund, dismantle, no bail laws of the Democratic Party. What has that resulted in, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  in small towns and big cities around the country? Violence and chaos everywhere. We have two wars, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=435.84s)]
*  war in Europe, war in the Middle East, and we could go on and on. I mean, but your president [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=442.8s)]
*  also has a terrible history with African Americans and I feel like I'm a voice in the wilderness. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=448.88s)]
*  Nobody ever wants to talk about it. The only person that ever did, interestingly, in a primary [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  debate, was Kamala Harris. As a Senator, Joe Biden, he worked side by side with segregationists, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=461.12s)]
*  even bragged about that part. In this case, against busing and integration of public schools. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=467.92s)]
*  Remember, Joe Biden said he didn't want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle. His mentor, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=473.12s)]
*  his friend, his words in the Senate was the former Klansman from West Virginia, Robert KKK Bird. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  But that didn't stop Joe from lying and telling everybody that he was actually a civil rights [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=487.92s)]
*  icon, even made up a story about getting arrested in apartheid South Africa while supporting Nelson [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=493.92s)]
*  Mandela. It never happened. Remember in 2020, pearly white Joe Biden even seemed to think that he [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=500.24s)]
*  alone could decide who is really truly African American, black in America. Remember Charlemagne [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=508.24s)]
*  the God. You know, if you don't vote for me, well, you ain't black. Wow. And that's not all. Take a look. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=516.16s)]
*  Madam President, we have predators on our streets. What kind of a chance with a North Eastern liberal [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=523.92s)]
*  like Joe Biden stand in the South? Better than anybody else. You don't know my state. My state [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=529.28s)]
*  was a slave state. You got the first sort of mainstream African American who was articulate and bright and clean and nice looking guy. I mean, that's a story. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=535.04s)]
*  You're gonna put you all back in chains. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. We got more questions. You got more questions. But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=550.56s)]
*  I love this. You know, for the first time ever, articulate, bright and clean. That storybook, man. Wow. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=564.16s)]
*  Anyway, instead of actually improving the lives of African Americans, Joe Biden is hoping to win back their vote with sheer politics, fear mongering, pandering, and of course the big lie. All Republicans are racist. Really? With that track record? Unfortunately for Joe, he can barely string two sentences together without getting lost and dazed and confused. As we mentioned at the top, Democrats, they're in full panic mode. You saw James Carville. We've played it many times. Nothing they're throwing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=574.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is working. Nothing. And as the very real possibility of a second Trump term now comes squarely into focus, well, things are not going well for Joe. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfwddltMOU&t=603.28s)]
