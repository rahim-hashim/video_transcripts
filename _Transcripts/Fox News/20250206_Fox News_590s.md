# Trump AG Pam Bondi has a warning for sanctuary cities
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko)
*  Anyway, joining us now, our very first interview after being sworn in by Clarence Thomas, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=0.0s)]
*  new attorney general of the United States, longtime friend of the program, Pam Bondi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Pam, great to have you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=10.28s)]
*  Well, you've had your own shock and aught, you know, 30 hours since being in office. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=11.92s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=18.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=19.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=20.6s)]
*  Just landed from New Orleans, as you said. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=21.6s)]
*  And you know, Kristi Noem with Homeland Security has done a great job working in conjunction [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=23.56s)]
*  with our ATF agents, our DEA agents, our FBI agents getting ready for the Super Bowl. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=29.06s)]
*  Also, Sean went out today and met with the family of Matthew Tanadaro. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=35.1s)]
*  I met his mom, Kathy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  He was killed on January 1st in that horrific, horrific murder in New Orleans. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=43.42s)]
*  And I got briefed on that today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=49.22s)]
*  So it's been a very busy day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=51.22s)]
*  Met with over 30 members more of law enforcement in New Orleans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=52.78s)]
*  They are prepared for the Super Bowl. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=57.4s)]
*  Kathy Lanier with the NFL. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=59.38s)]
*  They are crushing it out there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=61.24s)]
*  And they are going to keep New Orleans and Louisiana safe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=62.72s)]
*  And I'm proud to be part of that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=66.32s)]
*  I'm glad to hear that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=68.52s)]
*  Let me start with theâ€”you've cracked down on sanctuary cities. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=70.0s)]
*  The DOJ has put a pause on all federal funding to sanctuary cities and states. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=75.36s)]
*  You filed a lawsuit against Chicago and the state of Illinois for being a sanctuary city. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=81.48s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=86.52s)]
*  Am I interpretation that a sanctuary city is aiding and abetting and law breaking? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=87.52s)]
*  Sean, what they're doing is they are choosing illegal aliens over the safety and security [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=92.32s)]
*  of their own citizens and the men and women of law enforcement who are out there trying [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=98.88s)]
*  to protect their citizens. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=103.68s)]
*  Not only did we sue today the city of Chicago, we sued the state of Illinois, we sued the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=105.36s)]
*  mayor, we sued the governor, and we sued others. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=111.0s)]
*  And let me be very clear. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=115.32s)]
*  If you don't comply with federal law, you're going to be next. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=116.32s)]
*  What about those that we now know apparently tipped off the Trend Day or Rockwell Gang [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=120.96s)]
*  in Colorado prior to an ICE raid? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=126.08s)]
*  Obviously, that would be breaking the law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=129.44s)]
*  Will we get to the bottom of that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=131.64s)]
*  Yes, Sean, absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=133.56s)]
*  And you know, that risked the lives of our great men and women in law enforcement. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=135.2s)]
*  This is horrific what these people are doing to try to destroy our country, truly, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=142.0s)]
*  jeopardize the lives of law enforcement and our citizens. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=148.48s)]
*  And Tom Homan is absolutely right to be appalled and furious. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=152.0s)]
*  But we will all get to the bottom of this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=156.28s)]
*  And you know, Donald Trump has created an incredible team of people who truly, we were [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  pre-existing friends, so many of us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=163.8s)]
*  We get along great and we work so well together. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=166.6s)]
*  And we truly like each other. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  And we support everything President Trump is doing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=174.0s)]
*  And we are all here to protect our country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=177.44s)]
*  And that's what it's all about right now, Sean, keeping America safe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  My biggest fear, the thing that would keep me up at night, is that we know, because of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=184.6s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas, we have known terrorists in the country, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=190.44s)]
*  we don't know where they are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=195.72s)]
*  You mentioned the order to go after cartels and work with DHS on that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=197.4s)]
*  I'm glad you're doing that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=201.72000000000003s)]
*  I'm worried about them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=202.84s)]
*  I worry about gangs in the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  But we also have known murderers, rapists, other violent criminals. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=206.12s)]
*  How do we find them? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=210.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, Tom Homan, Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, DHS, they're doing a great job. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=212.24s)]
*  And what we're doing with all of our FBI agents, DEA, ATF, all of the federal agents, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  everyone is going to work together and they're going to actually prosecute violent crime [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=225.64s)]
*  instead of weaponizing government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=230.76s)]
*  And that's what's been happening. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  And Maisie Hirono is wrong. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=235.48s)]
*  It's the end of the weaponization of government and getting back to prosecuting violent crime [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  and giving our great men and women the tools that they need in law enforcement to go after [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=242.6s)]
*  these horrific gangs, the drug dealers, the fentanyl dealers who are killing people on [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=248.56s)]
*  our streets every day and the cartels. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=254.16s)]
*  And we will do everything in our power to find them and eradicate them in our country. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=257.48s)]
*  And that's thanks to Donald Trump and the many executive orders that he's issued. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=262.48s)]
*  I want to ask you, Judge Eileen Cannon, in the Jack Smith case against President Trump [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=267.68s)]
*  and in the documents case, finally kicked the case out of court. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=273.08s)]
*  It was over because of what she believed was an illegitimate appointment of Jack Smith. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  And the issue always comes before an attorney general on the appointment of special counsels. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=285.8s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, special counsels from here on out in our country will be legally appointed and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=292.88s)]
*  they won't be done constantly like they've been done in the past. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=300.68s)]
*  And yeah, Judge Cannon is a brilliant judge. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=304.64s)]
*  We followed the law that will be upheld and the weaponization of government will end. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=307.06s)]
*  No more special counsels out there targeting anyone. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=313.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=317.1s)]
*  Let me, when we talk about weaponization, I would say we didn't have equal justice [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=318.1s)]
*  or application of our laws with President Trump. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=324.58s)]
*  I would argue that, okay, if top secret classified information is something worth raiding Mar-a-Lago [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=327.58s)]
*  about why didn't they raid the four locations where Joe Biden had top secret classified information? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  Why didn't they raid Hillary Clinton's home? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  She deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=343.94s)]
*  She had top secret classified information on it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=347.0s)]
*  That to me is not equal justice under the law or equal application of our laws. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=350.18s)]
*  What do you make of a justice system that has only targeted somebody because of their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=356.42s)]
*  political beliefs? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=362.18s)]
*  Well, it's a two tiered system of justice, Sean, and it will no longer be in existence [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=363.18s)]
*  in our country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=370.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=372.38s)]
*  What Joe Biden did, of course, was he didn't even have the right to take classified documents. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=373.38s)]
*  And we all know they were sitting in his garage, yet no one chose to prosecute him. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=379.94s)]
*  They have targeted Donald Trump from day one. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=385.72s)]
*  We've known this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=389.62s)]
*  We've always known this, and that is going to stop. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=391.14s)]
*  We're going to get back to the core function of what our government, our law enforcement, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=393.14s)]
*  was intended to do, prosecute violent criminals and get them off our streets. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=399.02s)]
*  Weaponization ends, and it ended the day that Donald Trump took office. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=404.54s)]
*  And the American people saw that crystal clear because they elected him by a landslide. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=408.86s)]
*  You know, we also saw, for example, you know, I know you know the value of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=415.86s)]
*  It's worth over a billion dollars. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=421.86s)]
*  We had a judge in New York value it at 18 million, which was a joke and didn't care. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=423.42s)]
*  You have local prosecutors like Alvin Bragg. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=430.5s)]
*  The statute of limitations had run out on what was a legal NDA put together by an attorney [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=433.66s)]
*  and labeled as a legal expense, and then came up with a novel legal theory to go after Donald [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=438.52s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=445.0s)]
*  And they got away with that, and nobody on the left seemed to care. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=446.84s)]
*  And I watched during your hearings and the hearings of others, now all of a sudden the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=450.2s)]
*  left, who never, they never uttered a word. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=454.44s)]
*  Their silence was deafening about unequal justice under the law. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=457.4s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, they seem to fear that which they did to Donald Trump might be done [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=461.88s)]
*  to them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=467.08s)]
*  Have you noticed the same thing I have? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=468.76s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=470.6s)]
*  I saw it with Adam Schiff in his hearing, and in fact, he received a pardon from President [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden, which is very telling to me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=477.36s)]
*  He received a pardon along with Liz Cheney. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=481.16s)]
*  They were more worried about Liz Cheney in my confirmation hearing than the crime in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  California that's skyrocketing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's truly remarkable, this double standard that they have been professing and projecting [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=491.48s)]
*  throughout our country. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=500.92s)]
*  But it has ended, Sean. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=501.92s)]
*  Let me ask a final question. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=505.32s)]
*  I believe under Merrick Garland and Joe Biden that DOJ has been weaponized. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=507.44s)]
*  With that, there are many, many employees at the Justice Department that were a part [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  of that weaponization. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=519.8s)]
*  Did they have an obligation not to participate in it, speak out against it? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=521.8s)]
*  If they didn't do so, would that be disqualifying in your mind? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=527.48s)]
*  Sean, certainly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=531.96s)]
*  You have to follow the ethical standards of being a prosecutor, and you have to follow [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=534.6s)]
*  the law. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=540.52s)]
*  And that's why we have signed multiple executive orders taking us back to our core function [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=541.76s)]
*  of prosecuting real crime and violent crime. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=547.52s)]
*  And that's how this Justice Department will function, and that's how President Trump wants [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=551.2s)]
*  this administration to function, even-handedly and fair, and restore integrity. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  I've known you for decades. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=562.96s)]
*  Honestly, that's probably the word that I would use the most to define you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=564.6400000000001s)]
*  You will bring integrity to the DOJ, return it to its former greatness, and we wish you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=569.0s)]
*  all the best. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=575.6400000000001s)]
*  We really appreciate you being on with us, and congratulations. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMEsNaW7ko&t=586.2s)]
