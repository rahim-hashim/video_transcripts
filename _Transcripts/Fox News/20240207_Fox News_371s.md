# Hannity: Biden reaches a new low
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU)
*  Now, last night was the Nevada primary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=0.0s)]
*  Remember, Trump was not on the ballot. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=2.4s)]
*  He's participating in the caucus tomorrow. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  That is the voting that actually counts for RNC delegates. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=7.16s)]
*  Not exactly sure what Nikki Haley's team was thinking, but they opted to participate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=10.8s)]
*  in Nevada's primary, despite no delegates being at stake. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=16.44s)]
*  And she's not participating in the caucus. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=21.16s)]
*  It was either one or the other. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=23.0s)]
*  This is where things got a little bit weird. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=25.38s)]
*  In Nevada's primary, well, voters are allowed to choose, quote, none of these candidates [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=27.56s)]
*  on the ballot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  That option yesterday ended up beating Nikki Haley by over 30 points. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=33.4s)]
*  Now, Nikki Haley's home state of South Carolina is up next. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=38.4s)]
*  Now the question has got to be asked. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=41.64s)]
*  After a third place finish in Iowa and the caucus is there, double-digit loss in New [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=43.6s)]
*  Hampshire, last night's numbers, you know, the question is, if Nikki Haley doesn't win [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=48.16s)]
*  her home state, what is her path for the nomination? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=53.36s)]
*  I'll ask her in a soon-to-come interview. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=56.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=58.68s)]
*  According to the Real Clear Politics Average, as of now, she is losing to former President [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=59.68s)]
*  Donald Trump by more than 30 points in her home state of South Carolina. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=63.96s)]
*  And speaking of polls, we have brand-new Gallup surveys. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=67.84s)]
*  They spell a lot more trouble for Joe Biden, as Democrats now are struggling with very [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=70.48s)]
*  key demographics that helped elect him in 2020. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=75.04s)]
*  Look at the surveys conducted during the entirety of 2023. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=78.58s)]
*  Democrats' advantage among non-Hispanic black voters is down to its lowest level since [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=82.8s)]
*  1999, while their margin with Hispanic voters is now at its lowest level since 2011, down [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  to just 12 points. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=94.8s)]
*  But it's not just minority voters that Democrats are struggling with. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=96.42s)]
*  They're also losing ground with young voters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  According to the Gallup poll, their advantage with 18- to 29-year-old voters is now just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=102.84s)]
*  8 points. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=107.84s)]
*  That's the lowest level since 2005. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=109.16s)]
*  And while the Democrats and Biden are struggling in the polls as a whole, perhaps no one has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=111.92s)]
*  suffered a bigger polling crisis than your giggling vice president. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  That's right, Vice President Harris, who, according to a new NBC survey, now has a favorability [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  rating of only 28 percent compared to 53 percent, who have a negative view of her. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=127.52s)]
*  And as Democrats continue sliding in these polls, the Supreme Court, they are poised [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=134.1s)]
*  to hear arguments over the left's attempt to remove Trump from the ballot in Colorado [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, a tactic that former Obama adviser David Axelrod, he's a lot of things, he's not dumb. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  He called it very disruptive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=150.72s)]
*  Here's what he said earlier today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=152.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  There are myriad legal questions that they're going to consider tomorrow. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Some will undoubtedly offer off-ramps if they want an off-ramp. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=157.12s)]
*  But I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if the Supreme Court said, we're removing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=161.2s)]
*  the front running Republican candidate from the ballot and essentially saying to the American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=166.04s)]
*  people, you won't have the opportunity to vote for him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=175.32s)]
*  And I think it would be very, very disruptive in this country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it will create a huge reaction. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=183.16s)]
*  And that worries me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=187.12s)]
*  Well, it should, I think. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=188.12s)]
*  In terms of does that for the people that claim, oh, democracy is in peril, how undemocratic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden is refusing to sit down for a Super Bowl interview. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=197.56s)]
*  This is now the second year in a row he has refused to do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  After yesterday, maybe it's kind of easy to see why. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=204.92s)]
*  Let's refresh your memories. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  There is some movement and I don't want to, I don't want to, well, maybe choose my words. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=209.72s)]
*  There's some movement. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=218.6s)]
*  There's been a response from the, there's been a response from the opposition. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=220.52s)]
*  But yes, I'm sorry, from Hamas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=235.08s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=239.88s)]
*  The terror group is called Hamas. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=241.72s)]
*  What about all the people that were critical when I was one of the first people to pull [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=244.72s)]
*  out this significant cognitive decline? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=248.08s)]
*  You're still defending Joe's cognitive state. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=251.0s)]
*  Now that wasn't Biden's only flub of the week. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=253.56s)]
*  You also made a major slip up when speaking at a campaign event in Vegas on Sunday. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's refresh your memory on that one. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=261.44s)]
*  Right after I was elected, I went to what they call a G7 meeting and all the NATO leaders. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=264.36s)]
*  I was in, I was in the south of England. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=270.0s)]
*  And I sat down and I said, America's back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=273.44s)]
*  And Medaron from Germany, I mean, from France looked at me and said, said, you know, what, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=276.92s)]
*  why, how long you back for? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=288.12s)]
*  Ask yourself a question. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=291.88s)]
*  Have you ever gone to Walmart, Target? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=292.88s)]
*  And a lot of times they have greeters. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=296.28s)]
*  older people retired that for whatever reason, maybe they're just bored. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=299.24s)]
*  They want a little extra cash. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=303.64s)]
*  They meet you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=305.32s)]
*  They greet you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=306.32s)]
*  Welcome to Walmart. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=307.32s)]
*  And then you say, how are you? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  Can I help you with anything? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=310.08s)]
*  They're the nicest, most helpful people you'll ever meet in your life and pleasant and smart. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=311.08s)]
*  I don't think Joe could be a Walmart greeter because I don't think he could remember in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=316.68s)]
*  a Walmart superstore, whether or not where all of the different departments are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't think he could do that job. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=326.38s)]
*  News flashed to president Joe Biden, a president meter on died in 1996. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=328.08s)]
*  So unless you're time traveling or you're speaking to a ghost, you didn't speak to president [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  meter on no wonder Joe snubbed the Superbowl interview now for the second year in a row. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=340.56s)]
*  The reason is obvious. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=345.56s)]
*  He is totally incapable of handling any unscripted interview. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=346.56s)]
*  Now tonight, instead of dealing with the border crisis, Biden is participating all day in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  fundraisers in New York City and stifling traffic there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMOVLWY5PU&t=355.68s)]
