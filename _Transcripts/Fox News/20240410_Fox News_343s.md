# Tim Scott: We need '4 more years' of Trump
**Fox News:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI)
*  All right now according to some reports my next guest is now ABC among them the front-runner to become Donald Trump's running mate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=0.0s)]
*  He had to respond to that more South Carolina Senator Tim Scott senator. I'm sure you heard about it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=7.4s)]
*  I'm sure you read about it want to get your thoughts about it [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=13.16s)]
*  Well Sean there's no doubt that we need four more years of Donald Trump [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=17.8s)]
*  And I will do everything in my power to make sure we get four more years of Donald Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=20.68s)]
*  It is the best outcome for all of America listening to your brilliant [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  monologue reminds me of election engineering where there is the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=30.6s)]
*  DNC [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=35.6s)]
*  CNN MSNBC ABC [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=36.8s)]
*  NBC and CBS they have become an extension of the liberal elite who are trying to have election engineering [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=39.64s)]
*  They're trying to engineer an outcome listen Sean they have lost their minds [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=46.58s)]
*  Because they're losing their voters [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=51.800000000000004s)]
*  Bottom line is that we have to coalesce around Donald Trump so that we get four more years of low inflation four more years of low unemployment [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=53.96s)]
*  and frankly a return to a fair and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=61.44s)]
*  equal America [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=65.88s)]
*  Everybody deserves the chance to succeed, but you got to work for it and unfortunately the liberal left [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=67.76s)]
*  They are losing their minds because they're losing their voters and thank God Almighty [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=74.16s)]
*  That Donald Trump has the backbone and the tenacity to stand in the fire [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=78.8s)]
*  Because if it's not him it will be me and it will be you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=84.04s)]
*  You know we recently lost Joe Lieberman. I was friends with Joe Lieberman. I like Joe Lieberman [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=88.4s)]
*  He was sort of like the canary in the coal mine. He was the vice presidential candidate for Democrats in 2000 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=94.56s)]
*  Then the party threw him overboard and he had to run as an independent to win back his seat in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=101.08s)]
*  Connecticut which he did so successfully and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  What does it say about the Democratic Party today that they're so radicalized that either? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=110.64s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=118.2s)]
*  Betrays Israel as they they were attacked they were victims of terror like we were victims of terror on 9-eleven [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=119.92s)]
*  Oh one this is the worst terror attack in their history [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=126.7s)]
*  Hamas started this it was unprovoked [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=130.8s)]
*  Israel rightly is trying to win their war on terror [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden is putting a knife in their back trying to influence their elections [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=137.52s)]
*  And and he's put his own personal [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Political ambition above fighting terrorists because of the pressure from within his party [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=146.36s)]
*  What does that say about the party of Lieberman or the party of Scoop Jackson if you want to go back even further? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=151.96s)]
*  What has happened to this party that has become that radicalized? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=158.8s)]
*  That they've taken the side of radical terrorists over the right of a country to win a war against terrorists [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  It's just disgusting senator Lieberman would be rolling over in his grave [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=171.12s)]
*  Think about the fact that this administration told Israel on October the 7th the day of the attacks to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=175.72000000000003s)]
*  Stand down think about the fact that is this administration that approved green lighted [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=183.28000000000003s)]
*  Billions of dollars 10 billion in November 6 billion in August green lighting more money to actually fund [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=190.28s)]
*  Iranian proxies that are killing and targeting Americans [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=198.36s)]
*  It's this administration that has allowed daylight between the United States of America and our greatest ally in the Middle East [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=202.36s)]
*  Israel I can't think of a greater dereliction of duty save [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=211.04s)]
*  Afghanistan when we lost 13 American soldiers then what we're watching right now on display for every American to see [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  90% of Americans actually agree with standing shoulder to shoulder with our Israel our ally Israel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=223.98s)]
*  We all know Psalms 1 22 6 pray for the peace of Jerusalem and those who do will prosper [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  This administration has lost its mind this administration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=238.18s)]
*  Continues to prove that we are not loyal to our allies and therefore we cannot be lethal to our adversaries [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=243.1s)]
*  Hamas continues to grow because this administration [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=250.26s)]
*  Put so many handcuffs on Netanyahu and Israel that the war continues to drag on [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  give them the resources the weaponry to finish this fight as [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=261.34s)]
*  Quickly as possible and that's how you save lives [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  You don't save lives by turning your back on your greatest ally in the Middle East [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=269.3s)]
*  All right. Let me ask you this based on tonight's report [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=275.22s)]
*  Have you had any conversation with President Trump about potentially being and running as his vice president? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=278.18s)]
*  And if you are asked, what would you say? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=285.14s)]
*  There's no doubt that President Trump will make that decision I believe before the convention [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=289.58s)]
*  I have not had any specific conversation with the president. I can tell you one thing whatever it takes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=295.16s)]
*  Whatever it takes for President Donald Trump to have four more years [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=301.56s)]
*  Whatever it takes to restore sanity in the streets of America [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Count me in Sean. You're a patriot. I'm a patriot. I love America [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=311.24s)]
*  I'm not possible in any other country on the planet except for the city on the hill [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  That's America. All right the shining the shining city on the hill. All right. Great to see you Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAnsiRe1TI&t=323.64s)]
