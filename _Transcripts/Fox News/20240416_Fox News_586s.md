# Sean Hannity: This is the most pivotal election of our lifetime
**Fox News:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8)
*  Begin in Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden, your president, he spent the day on the campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=0.0s)]
*  trail talking to voters in a critical, crucial battleground state. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=5.04s)]
*  We are just 202 days away until an inflection point for this country, probably the most [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=9.72s)]
*  pivotal election in our lifetime. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=16.46s)]
*  Every campaign stop is crucial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=18.96s)]
*  Donald Trump was not able to campaign today at all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=21.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=24.48s)]
*  We are stuck in a dreary New York City courtroom and we'll be stuck in that very same courtroom [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=26.48s)]
*  almost every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday for the foreseeable future, likely [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=30.68s)]
*  well over a month. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=36.08s)]
*  Donald Trump was told that he will go straight to jail and not collect $200 if he's not [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=37.52s)]
*  in court every single day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=43.36s)]
*  And Joe Biden has the swing state playing field all to himself with only 202 days until [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And the media mob, they are literally, well, elated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=52.96s)]
*  One fake news CNN host celebrating with a banner that read, quote, Biden hits the trail [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  while Trump sits in court. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=62.36s)]
*  No wonder so few people watch fake news CNN. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=65.28s)]
*  And they're at the conspiracy theory channel MSDNC. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=68.28s)]
*  They are working extra, extra hard this week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=71.84s)]
*  Their fairy tales, of course, about Russia, Russia, Russia never came true, but they will [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  never miss an opportunity every second minute, hour, every day, every week, every month, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  every year to bash Donald Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=84.36s)]
*  And they are not alone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=87.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=88.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the courthouse right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=89.68s)]
*  I mean, history has begun. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=91.92s)]
*  And the Biden campaign says that while Trump is in court, Biden is, quote, running the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=94.64s)]
*  country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  The judge is in a tough spot here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  No judge wants to be that, you know, person that is the one to throw former President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=102.0s)]
*  Trump in jail for criminal contempt. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=108.48s)]
*  What do Democrats do? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=112.84s)]
*  How do his opponents try to utilize this time? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=114.08s)]
*  Well, Joe, the split screen will be Donald Trump in a courtroom, Joe Biden on a campaign [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=116.92s)]
*  trail. So I think that's very important juxtaposition. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=122.24s)]
*  Why is it that it's only coming to trial now? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=125.6s)]
*  It turns out that is kind of a funny story, funny in a bad way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=128.96s)]
*  This is a legal nerd Super Bowl, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=132.0s)]
*  Like, I'm kind of excited about that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=134.6s)]
*  That's the part I need to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=136.96s)]
*  That's exciting to someone like me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=138.72s)]
*  Downright, Kitty, make no mistake. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  This is no ordinary trial. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=143.8s)]
*  This is a taxpayer funded, media promoted political smear campaign against Donald Trump [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  and miraculously and perfectly timed just for the presidential election. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=152.8s)]
*  Now, the prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, he hates Donald Trump. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  He ran on a hate Trump campaign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=161.36s)]
*  He hates him for political reasons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=163.56s)]
*  The judge, Juan Mershon is his name. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=165.56s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=168.4s)]
*  Guess who he donated to in 2020? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=172.56s)]
*  And the jury pool is comprised of Americans living in deep blue New York City. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Only 12 percent of the electorate there voted for Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=178.4s)]
*  The alleged crime, it's hard to describe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=182.28s)]
*  They haven't really told us yet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=185.36s)]
*  It is a misdemeanor document label allegation that dates back eight years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=187.24s)]
*  By the way, just for the record, well past the statute of limitations that Alvin Bragg [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=192.72s)]
*  mysteriously brought back to life by turning it into a felony on federal election law. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=198.52s)]
*  But none of that really matters, does it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=206.56s)]
*  This is not about justice. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not about keeping Americans safe. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you really think this is a threat to any American? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=212.84s)]
*  In New York City, let's see, you have violent criminals, you have gang members, you have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  drug dealers, you have sex offenders, you have cops being beaten up by the criminals [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=219.4s)]
*  and little old ladies going to church getting the crap beat out of them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=224.84s)]
*  And they escape Alvin Bragg's very lax prosecution every single day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=228.8s)]
*  But with Donald Trump, well, Bragg, who reduced 60 percent of all felonies to misdemeanors, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=233.08s)]
*  well he twisted the law into a pretzel, bending over backwards, spending millions of your [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=238.96s)]
*  dollars to bring a case that frankly never should have been brought. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=244.6s)]
*  For Democrats, the mob and the media, it is worth every penny, even sacrificing the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=248.84s)]
*  rule of law at our great constitutional republic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=254.16s)]
*  It removes Donald Trump from the campaign trail at the height of an election. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=257.76s)]
*  The trial also gives the left yet another opportunity to trash Donald Trump in public. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=262.0s)]
*  The former president, meanwhile, he was not afforded that same right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=267.26s)]
*  His freedom of speech, it's been stripped away. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=271.36s)]
*  The judge ordered Trump to keep his mouth shut. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=274.2s)]
*  It barring him from talking about witnesses or members of the court. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=277.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, all these witnesses, they're more than welcome to smear, slander, besmirch [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=281.44s)]
*  Trump anytime, anyplace, anywhere. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=286.48s)]
*  And by the way, in fact, the state's key witness in this case is Michael Cohen, an [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=289.64s)]
*  admitted convicted liar and felon all over cable TV. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=294.52s)]
*  He has plenty to say about Donald Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=298.28s)]
*  He even is live streaming his anti-Trump vitriol on TikTok. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=301.06s)]
*  The state's other possible star witness, a porn star who previously denied ever receiving [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=305.1s)]
*  a hush pay, quote, money payment multiple times, including this signed statement. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=311.32s)]
*  Take a look at it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=317.42s)]
*  Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=318.42s)]
*  If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump, well, trust me, you wouldn't be reading [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=323.04s)]
*  about it in the news. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=328.82s)]
*  You wouldn't be reading about it in my book. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=329.94s)]
*  The fact of the matter is these stories are not true. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=332.2s)]
*  And then now, of course, that was reported in what, 2008, 2006, all these years, same [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=335.84s)]
*  thing, same non-story. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  That was signed in January of 2018. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=344.56s)]
*  Now, non-disclosure agreements or NDAs, as they are known, they're not illegal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=346.76s)]
*  But again, Trump is on trial for allegedly mislabeling an NDA from eight years ago and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=351.8s)]
*  only now, 200 days before election, when this was a case that happened eight years [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=359.48s)]
*  ago. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  The judge in this case says that he will treat Donald Trump fairly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  OK, I'm betting on that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=370.36s)]
*  Of course, now, this judge is a Democrat. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  This judge donated to Joe Biden, Trump's opponent, and another anti-Trump cause in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=376.88s)]
*  2020. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=382.16s)]
*  So think about this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=383.16s)]
*  This is the most high-profile, politically charged case in the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  The judge had donated to Trump's political rival. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=388.7s)]
*  And according to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, well, the judge's daughter is a, quote, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  Democratic political operative who has financially benefited from her father's unprecedented [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  trial of President Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=402.74s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  Keep in mind, New York law actually forbids this type of prejudice. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=406.06s)]
*  Here's Article 2, Section 14 of the state's Statuary Grounds for Disqualification, quote, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=410.06s)]
*  A judge shall not sit as such in or take part in the decision of an action, claim, matter, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=417.98s)]
*  motion or proceeding to which he is a party or in which he has been attorney or counsel [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  or in which he is interested or if he is related, key word there, related to any party to the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=430.94s)]
*  controversy within the sixth degree. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  In other words, if you have a daughter, for example, and that daughter is a Democratic [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=440.42s)]
*  operative working against your defendant, you can't preside over the case, especially [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=445.36s)]
*  if there's money involved. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=450.12s)]
*  We did reach out to the firm where the judge's daughter does work. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=451.68s)]
*  They haven't gotten back to us yet. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=455.72s)]
*  The judge, meanwhile, doesn't seem to understand the concept of a fair trial. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=457.92s)]
*  He has already threatened Donald Trump with jail if he fails to appear at any point during [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  this trial. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=467.0s)]
*  He is even, at this point, hesitant to let Trump attend his son's high school graduation. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=468.0s)]
*  He also slapped Trump with an unprecedented gag order while refusing to do the same for [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=474.06s)]
*  those now trashing Donald Trump in public. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=479.74s)]
*  They get to talk all they want. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=482.1s)]
*  Donald Trump, he's got to keep his mouth shut. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  And today, according to reports during jury selection, the judge denied a challenge. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=486.82s)]
*  He'll love this, to remove a potential juror because of extraordinarily hostile videos [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=492.3s)]
*  to social media celebrating Donald Trump's 2020 loss. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=499.7s)]
*  How on earth is that not a cause for disqualification? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=505.38s)]
*  Is that not somebody that comes across as abusively biased? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  Instead, the judge admonished Trump for muttering during the challenge, how dare a word come [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=514.26s)]
*  out of his mouth. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=520.4399999999999s)]
*  This is not a fair trial. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=521.9s)]
*  Again, this isn't a trial at all. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=523.3s)]
*  Now, according to a new Associated Press poll, only one in three Americans think Trump acted [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=525.42s)]
*  illegally. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=530.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is taking it all in stride. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=531.9s)]
*  After the day in court, he ended up at a bodega in New York City. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=534.5s)]
*  You got to watch this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=537.9799999999999s)]
*  Look at this crowd. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=538.9799999999999s)]
*  They want law and order. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=539.9799999999999s)]
*  They have a lot of crime, tremendous crime where their stores are being robbed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  And as you know, we're going to give New York a very good shot for the presidency. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=545.9799999999999s)]
*  We think we should be able to do it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=550.14s)]
*  A lot of things have changed. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=552.18s)]
*  Lee Zeldin did a beautiful job. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=553.18s)]
*  He ran, he lost by a little bit. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=554.94s)]
*  And New York's a lot different. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=556.94s)]
*  And we'll work with the mayor, and we'll work with the governor, and we'll bring in a lot [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=558.94s)]
*  of federal money, but we have to straighten out New York. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=562.94s)]
*  And that includes crime. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=565.94s)]
*  And these guys have great people, great friends, but they have tremendous crime. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=567.94s)]
*  So we got to straighten that out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=571.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8xyEbi4k8&t=584.94s)]
