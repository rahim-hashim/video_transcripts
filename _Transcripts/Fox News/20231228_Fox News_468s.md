# Kayleigh McEnany: I'm sick and tired of hearing this
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY)
*  Today, both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mayorkas traveled to Mexico City to beg Mexico's president to do something, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=4.8s)]
*  anything to stop the massive flow of immigrants constantly traveling north through the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=10.32s)]
*  Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador predicted the failures of the Biden presidency from the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=16.32s)]
*  very beginning. You may not remember this, but this is 2021. Obrador, this is Mexico's president, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=22.16s)]
*  described just how migrants viewed President Biden. He said, quote, they see him as the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=27.44s)]
*  migrant president and so many feel they're going to reach the United States and voila, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=33.52s)]
*  they have in record numbers. He was right. And at today's meeting with Mexico's president, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=39.04s)]
*  noticeably missing was Biden's border czar, Kamala Harris. She's on a leisurely trip to California [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=44.64s)]
*  and won't return to the office until January 3rd. Here now with reaction, former ICE director and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=51.2s)]
*  Fox News contributor, Tom Homan. He's an expert on all of this, along with Florida Congressman [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=56.56s)]
*  Byron Donalds, who has put forward legislation to stop what we're seeing at the southern border. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  You know, let me start with you, Congressman Donalds. I'm sick and tired of hearing people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=67.36s)]
*  say Republicans do not have a plan. You passed HR2. You did your job in the House. Let's scroll it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=72.16s)]
*  for our viewers. Here are all of the things in HR2 that Republicans have done. And you can read it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  as we go along. Security fencing, 22,000 minimum border border patrol agents and much more. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=83.84s)]
*  Congressman. Well, first of all, Kayleigh, it's great to be with you. You're absolutely correct. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=89.76s)]
*  House Republicans have a plan. We've had one for a very long time. I have a plan that adds to this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=97.36s)]
*  It creates actually an exit biometric system, something that 9-11 Commission recommended that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=102.64s)]
*  we do post 9-11. The federal government still hasn't completed that work. But this is bigger [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=107.44s)]
*  than that. You have an administration, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and everybody else. They do not want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=112.4s)]
*  to do the simple job of securing the border. And so now when you have a massive catastrophe [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=117.76s)]
*  which they created, now they're going down to Mexico to see what can be done. The answer is simple. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Do follow the House Republicans, HR2. It's the plan. And let me be very clear. We've been telling [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=128.96s)]
*  this to the Democrats in the Senate and Joe Biden. Don't even talk to us about Ukraine until the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=134.08s)]
*  southern border is secured. Secure America first, then we can have conversations about everything [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=140.08s)]
*  else. But this must be done. It simply cannot wait. You know, Tom Homan, you and I both worked [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=144.96s)]
*  for a former president, President Trump, who got action from Mexico. He said, you're getting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=152.0s)]
*  tariffs unless you secure the border. And the Mexican president did just that, sent 6,000 troops [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  there to the border. What do you think when you see a meeting that went on today and zero deliverables [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=162.4s)]
*  from Mexico to be announced? They don't need any more meetings. This meeting doesn't mean squat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=168.72s)]
*  And you're right. President Trump didn't go to Mexico and beg for help. He didn't go to Central [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=175.52s)]
*  America and beg for help. He didn't give them millions of dollars. This administration has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=180.48s)]
*  given Mexico millions upon millions of dollars. They've given Central America millions of dollars. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=184.16s)]
*  President Trump was a game changer. He didn't give them a dime. Well, he told Mexico, you're [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=189.04s)]
*  going to put military on the southern border and the northern border. You're going to participate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=193.92s)]
*  in Remain in Mexico program. You can participate in the Third Safe Country Agreement. If you don't, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=197.28s)]
*  I'll tear the hell out of you. And they came to the table within days. Central America, he told [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=201.76s)]
*  them the same thing. I'm not going to pay to create opportunity zones down there because the money [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=206.16s)]
*  goes to the corrupt people and never gets where it needs to go. I told them, I'm going to do, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=210.4s)]
*  I'm going to take all international aid away. And they came to the table. And look, this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=214.0s)]
*  thing, if this administration is seriously about securing the border, which they're not, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=219.44s)]
*  they haven't done a single thing to slow the flow. It's easy. Dust off the Trump plans. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=223.36s)]
*  We proved it worked. It's not even a question. Will these policies work? We proved it worked. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=228.72s)]
*  Anybody go to CBP.gov and look at the numbers. The last two years under Trump, the most secure [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=233.28s)]
*  border in my career, three and a half decades. The data's clear. Illegal immigration at a 45-year [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=238.24s)]
*  low. We proved it worked. If they want to secure the border, they have the plan. Brush it off and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=243.76s)]
*  put it in place. Amen. I couldn't say it any better myself. And Congressman, that plan is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=248.16s)]
*  embodied in H.R.2. We know senators met today trying to craft a plan with foreign aid combined [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=254.72s)]
*  with immigration measures. What do you think is going to be acceptable to the House? Anything [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=261.2s)]
*  short of H.R.2 or you guys need H.R.2 in there? What's acceptable to the House is H.R.2. It's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=265.68s)]
*  simple stuff. We know it works. What we're not going to do is negotiate against ourselves [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=273.6s)]
*  for some ham-handed deal that gets negotiated in the Senate. We have seen Senate negotiations [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=278.88s)]
*  occur in this country before. They basically are weak sauce, not worth the paper that they're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=284.72s)]
*  printed on. The politicians in D.C. say, oh, this is great. Look at what we did, America. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=290.0s)]
*  And then the reality hits home that nothing really changed. H.R.2 is the starting point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=294.72s)]
*  The senators can negotiate all they want, but nothing's moving through the House without H.R.2. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=300.32s)]
*  Tom, and where does this end? You've got 15,000 migrants heading. You have this caravan. You have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=307.84s)]
*  Chinese nationals. Is there going to ever be a wake-up call? I mean, even politics. Democrats [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=312.32s)]
*  have said, Biden, you need to do something. We showed you the CNN clip. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=317.6s)]
*  First of all, let me footstomp what the congressman just said. H.R.2 needs to be passed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=322.64s)]
*  fully, 100 percent of it, because it's a great plan, because it has a lot of the Trump policies [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=327.44s)]
*  in it. H.R.2 fully or nothing, no deal. And I'm shocked that the Democrats are willing to let [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine and Israel suffer because they want an open border so badly. Look, these 15,000, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=337.52s)]
*  they're going to be processed and released in the United States. It's catch and release. And when [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  the cartels see thousands being released every day, that just gives them a selling point. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't need a public affairs officer. They don't need a consultant to sell their services. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=351.2s)]
*  U.S. government's actions every day sell services to the cartels because you cross the border [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=355.92s)]
*  illegally, you get released quickly, you get flown to the city of your choice on taxpayer dine, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  you get work authorization that's five or seven years, you get in a hotel room, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=365.76s)]
*  you get three squares a day and free medical. Why the hell wouldn't it come? Because we're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=370.08s)]
*  not enforcing law on the border. Kamala Harris, she called her border czar all she wants. She [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=374.08s)]
*  hasn't done a damn thing. She said, I want to find underlying reasons for this mass migration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=379.2s)]
*  She simply needs to walk down the hall into the Oval Office and she'll find the reason [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=384.56s)]
*  millions are coming across the border because they were made promises by this administration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=388.96s)]
*  You know, and Congressman Donald's, where's the president? I mean, he's on vacation. He sends [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=394.64s)]
*  Antony Blinken off. He sends my orcas off. They do nothing. No deliverables, zero. He's on vacation, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=399.44s)]
*  40 percent of his presidency. I mean, Kayleigh, let's let's be honest. This man is the most [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=406.88s)]
*  unaccountable president in American history. You combine that with being the worst president [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=413.2s)]
*  in American history. The man is probably taking a nap as we speak. I know it's a little over nine [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=418.4s)]
*  Eastern. He's already gone to bed. We have a problem, America. Joe Biden is awful at this job. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=422.88s)]
*  He is not a leader and he is a radical being led by radicals in that administration. They all need [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=429.2s)]
*  to go. And for America, listen, mean tweets, no mean tweets. Let's get somebody back in the White [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=435.44s)]
*  House who knows how to do the job and execute and put our country first. That's President Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=440.88s)]
*  Well, I hope President Biden enjoys that beachside vacation. Wow. Undeserved. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=448.88s)]
*  Congressman Donald's, Tom Holman, thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDCkPJlxMRY&t=453.6s)]
