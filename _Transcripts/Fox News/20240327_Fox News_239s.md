# Tim Scott: We have to continue to elect conservative senators
**Fox News:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q)
*  All right, joining us now from the great state of South Carolina, Senator Tim Scott is with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=0.0s)]
*  us, another solid conservative. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=3.68s)]
*  You know, frankly, I'm going to be honest, Senator. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=5.32s)]
*  You, Ted Cruz, there's a handful of you, but not enough that are conservative enough that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=8.56s)]
*  are willing to fight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=14.64s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=15.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=16.76s)]
*  We have to continue to elect conservative senators. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=19.62s)]
*  We need a majority in the Senate, not of just Republicans, but of conservatives, so that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=22.88s)]
*  we can call out this justice system that is actually the perversion of justice. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=28.3s)]
*  Sean, here's what we're looking at, and it is very clear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=34.1s)]
*  Tadam out to election interference is what we're seeing in New York, what we're seeing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=37.7s)]
*  in the DOJ. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=42.5s)]
*  They literally want to make sure that the voters do not have a choice. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=43.74s)]
*  This is not about democracy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  We are the greatest republic on the planet, and it looks like we are a kangaroo court, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=49.78s)]
*  because the perversion of justice is the end of America, and this is that plus election [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=55.78s)]
*  interference. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=62.78s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it in my life. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=63.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=67.82s)]
*  Let me ask you about what we see going on, and, you know, the one thing Biden can't talk [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=69.5s)]
*  about, he's not going to talk about his open borders policy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=75.06s)]
*  He's not going to take responsibility. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=77.9s)]
*  After three years of lying to us saying it was closed and secure, you know, now he's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=80.14s)]
*  blaming Republicans, which is beyond offensive to me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=83.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=87.38s)]
*  We're going to give a list of how many people have died that we know of. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=88.38s)]
*  They don't keep those records. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=92.34s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  And it's what he's doing to the economy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=95.22s)]
*  When you talk to constituents in South Carolina, what are they saying about the border? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=98.46s)]
*  What are they saying about the economy? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  What are they saying about prices and everyday living? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=106.52s)]
*  How do they feel about war in Europe and war in the Middle East? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=110.1s)]
*  They are losing their minds under Joe Biden. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  Here's a fact about South Carolinians. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  We are hardworking patriots who love America, and yet 60 percent of South Carolinians thereabout [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=120.34s)]
*  are still living paycheck to paycheck without a thousand dollars in their savings account. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=128.22s)]
*  Inflation has devastated the average South Carolinian, adding about $900 a month of additional [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=134.22s)]
*  expenses. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  That's more than $10,000 when your average income is around $50,000. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  That's 20 percent of your money gone because of Joe Biden's inflation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  The economy is imploding. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  You talk about the impact of open, unsecure borders. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=155.34s)]
*  70,000 Americans, but thousands of South Carolinians have lost their life to fentanyl. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  We've not even gotten to the fact that the 10 million invasion of illegal immigrants [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  is devastating every county and every state, absolutely here at home as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=174.34s)]
*  But law and order. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=180.42s)]

*  Remember, Kamala Harris is a person that started raising bail money for someone who was later [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  charged with murder. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=198.94s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=199.94s)]
*  Time for a change. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=200.94s)]
*  We were better with Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=201.94s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=203.38s)]

*  Oh, she's talking about the 574 riots in the summer of 2020 that everybody in the media [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  mob and Kamala Harris said was mostly peaceful. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=213.18s)]
*  Tell that to the dozens of dead Americans, the thousands of injured cops, and the property [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=216.54s)]
*  owners that had billions in property damage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  All right, Senator Tim Scott, thank you tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM90x5V40Q&t=224.29999999999998s)]
