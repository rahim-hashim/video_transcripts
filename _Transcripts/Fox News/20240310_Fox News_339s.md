# Biden reminded me on an 'angry old man' in State of Union address: Cruz
**Fox News:** [March 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls)
*  Make no mistake, what Joe Biden said tonight, the state of our union under his failed leadership [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=0.0s)]
*  is anything but strong. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=6.16s)]
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=8.24s)]
*  Senator, I promise not to yell at you during this interview. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=10.72s)]
*  Let's get first your reaction to the style. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=16.44s)]
*  Everybody knew that Joe had a very big challenge coming into tonight because—and we'll [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=19.76s)]
*  show tapes throughout the night of his cognitive decline. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=24.88s)]
*  Clearly, well, jacked up Joe, perhaps overcompensated, and I think that's being charitable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=29.0s)]
*  What was your reaction to that? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=35.64s)]
*  Look, I think tonight was astonishing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=37.44s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=39.36s)]
*  It was a campaign speech, but it was an exceptionally bad campaign speech. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=41.44s)]
*  Joe Biden was angry. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=45.16s)]
*  He was bitter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=47.08s)]
*  He was screaming, as you noted, the entire night. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=48.08s)]
*  He was radical and extreme. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=50.8s)]
*  And he was completely out of touch with the American people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=52.64s)]
*  Tonight, Joe Biden reminded me like an angry old man standing on his porch screaming to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=56.68s)]
*  the kids, get off my lawn. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=62.2s)]
*  That's who he was. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=65.4s)]
*  I've never seen—I've been to 12 state of the union addresses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=66.4s)]
*  I've never seen anything remotely like this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=69.12s)]
*  This was entirely focused on the November election, but what's remarkable, Sean, is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=72.72s)]
*  Joe Biden and the Biden White House, they apparently made the decision, A, they want [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  no Republican votes because this told every Republican, go jump in a lake. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=81.04s)]
*  We don't care about anything you believe in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=84.92s)]
*  They also decided, amazingly, they want no independent votes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  They've decided their strategy for November is go hard left and turn out the radical left. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  And it was, you know, in state of the unions, typically, whether you have a Democrat or [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=95.64s)]
*  Republican president who's giving the speech, there are a number of lines there that are [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=101.16s)]
*  designed to reach out to the other party, that get everyone standing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  I got to say, this was a state of the union. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=108.84s)]
*  In many ways, half the Republicans almost fell asleep because after welcoming the president, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=111.0s)]
*  where we stand and show respect for the office, we basically just sat there for over an hour [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  as he told lie after lie after lie, and he just went hard left. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=120.72s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=126.28s)]
*  But isn't there something behind that, though? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=129.0s)]
*  If you look at the traditional Democratic base and you butt that up against the recent [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=131.64s)]
*  We see he's losing such a large part of his base, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=138.08s)]
*  young people even, suburban women. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=145.08s)]
*  To me, it was very telling that the speech had to be geared in a way to sort of bring [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=148.72s)]
*  back that base and not reach out to the other side or not try to build his coalition. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=155.72s)]
*  He needs to reinforce what he's losing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=162.44s)]
*  Look, what was amazing, he almost never smiled the whole speech. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=165.6s)]
*  He was literally just yelling and he was pissed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  And this was a speech that was delivered to the squad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=172.2s)]
*  This was a speech that was trying to bring Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and AOC [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=175.28s)]
*  back on the team and the rest of America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=179.76s)]
*  He just didn't care. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=184.68s)]
*  Look, inflation, people are hurting with inflation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=185.6s)]
*  And what did he tell them? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=188.44s)]
*  No, you're not. You're wrong. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=189.28s)]
*  You're just stupid if you think that the cost of rent is higher, that the cost of your mortgage [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=191.36s)]
*  is higher, that the cost of food is higher. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  You're just too dumb. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=197.28s)]
*  You don't understand how good the economy really is. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  Look, people at home, they know the truth on that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=201.32s)]
*  When it came to crime, he just flat out created an alternative reality. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=204.08s)]
*  Crime is down, murders are down, everything is hunky-dory. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=208.32s)]
*  Listen, the people who are living with crime day to day, they know that's not true. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=210.8s)]
*  And I gotta say, there was no portion of the speech that was more through the looking glass. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  than on immigration. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=220.96s)]
*  Did Joe Biden acknowledge the 10.4 million illegal aliens he's led into this country? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=222.72s)]
*  No. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=227.72s)]
*  Did he acknowledge the open borders he's put in place deliberately? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=231.84s)]
*  Did he acknowledge the thousands of migrants who died because of his open borders? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Not a word. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=237.0s)]
*  Did he acknowledge the thousands and thousands of children sexually assaulted by human traffickers? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  The thousands of women brutally assaulted by human traffickers? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=242.8s)]
*  No. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=246.36s)]
*  Not a word. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=247.0s)]
*  Did he acknowledge the over 100,000 people a year dying of drug overdoses? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=247.84s)]
*  Not a word. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=252.52s)]
*  And did he have written in the speech even to say the words, Lakin Riley? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=253.8s)]
*  He did not. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=257.76s)]
*  Now, when he got to that point, a member on the floor of the House called out and heckled him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=259.0s)]
*  And he responded. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=265.04s)]
*  He said her name, so I'm gonna give him credit for that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=265.88s)]
*  But then what did he say? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=268.72s)]
*  He looked and said, I feel for her parents, they're hurting. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=269.76s)]
*  And Sean, he didn't take even a speck of responsibility. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  Her parents don't want you to emote in their direction and send them a damn Hallmark card. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=279.16s)]
*  You know what her parents want? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  They want their daughter back. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=285.8s)]
*  And what he didn't admit is that Lakin Riley is dead because when Joe Biden apprehended [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  the criminal illegal alien who crossed over, instead of deporting him, instead of following [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=294.56s)]
*  the law, Joe Biden let him go. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=299.8s)]
*  Then he went to New York City and New York City, he was arrested again for endangering [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=302.36s)]
*  a child again because New York City is run by Democrats and is a sanctuary city. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=307.0s)]
*  They let him go. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=312.12s)]
*  And if Joe Biden had deported that criminal or if New York City had put him in jail, Lakin [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=313.84s)]
*  Riley would be alive. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=318.32s)]
*  So he said her name, but he utterly denied his direct responsibility for her death and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=319.8s)]
*  for deaths all over the country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vTG9B57ls&t=325.71999999999997s)]
