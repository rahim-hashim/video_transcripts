# Bombshell Deposition: Top Republicans react to Hunter Biden's ex-business partner speaking out
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0)
*  Also breaking tonight, according to the DOJ, Hunter Biden's phone contained multiple pictures [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=0.0s)]
*  of what appeared to be crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia, saying that the pictures are [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=5.88s)]
*  more evidence that Hunter was using drugs when he claimed he was not on his gun application [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=11.86s)]
*  form. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=17.72s)]
*  And on the subject of drugs, the administration, maybe it's time to reopen that cocaine investigation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=18.72s)]
*  You know, who brought the bag of cocaine into the Biden White House? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=25.92s)]
*  They found no suspects after a really long 10-day investigation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=30.32s)]
*  This on top of, of course, the, we're told by the FBI that they believe they found residual [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  cocaine on Hunter's, what, I guess, gun or holster, one or the other. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=41.68s)]
*  Here with reaction to all the breaking news, we have the three lawmakers that are leading [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=47.6s)]
*  the Biden impeachment inquiry, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, House Judiciary [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=51.0s)]
*  Committee Chair Jim Jordan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=55.8s)]
*  Congressman Comer, we'll start with you tonight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=60.0s)]
*  Tony Bobulinski, the big guy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=62.04s)]
*  Biden was the business. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  What did you learn today? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=65.24s)]
*  Well, we learned a lot and Tony Bobulinski handled himself very well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=66.24s)]
*  I've never seen Democrats or anyone act worse in a deposition than they did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=70.84s)]
*  The Democrats couldn't handle the truth and that's what Tony Bobulinski delivered today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=76.16s)]
*  He delivered the truth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=80.4s)]
*  He talked about Joe's involvement. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=81.56s)]
*  He talked about the numerous times. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=83.84s)]
*  He talked to Joe Biden. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  He mentioned that Joe Biden thanked him for what he was doing with his brother and his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  son. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=93.84s)]
*  So Joe Biden knew very well the role Tony Bobulinski was playing in the, in the Biden [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=94.84s)]
*  orbit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  And he talked about what CEFC was. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=101.4s)]
*  And I think every American would be concerned if they could understand exactly what CEFC [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=104.56s)]
*  was trying to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  They were trying to implement their Belt and Road Initiative in the United States. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=111.58000000000001s)]
*  Everything that we have bipartisan agreement on in Congress to prevent China from doing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=116.22s)]
*  in the United States, CEFC was, was trying to acquire the services of the Bidens to be [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=121.42s)]
*  able to remove the barriers of entry into our markets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  So Joe Biden was working for the Chinese. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=129.34s)]
*  He was the brand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=132.5s)]
*  Tony Bobulinski is the second person on record under oath to testify that Joe Biden was the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=134.18s)]
*  brand. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=139.34s)]
*  Didn't he talk about millions and millions of dollars? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=141.02s)]
*  And he mentioned all these other countries as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=144.34s)]
*  And Joe's involvement, that he was directly involved in all of this in spite of what he [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=146.74s)]
*  told the American people as a candidate and as a president numerous times that he never [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  once spoke to his son, his brother or anybody for that matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=155.22000000000003s)]
*  Is that all true? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=158.94000000000003s)]
*  Do we know how many millions at this point? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=159.94000000000003s)]
*  Well we're over well over 20 million that the Bidens have taken, well over 8 million [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=163.18s)]
*  from China. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  We found out today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  That was because of Joe Biden. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=170.54s)]
*  They had no use in Hunter Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=172.54s)]
*  They certainly had no use in Jim Biden. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  They were paying for Joe Biden, the brand. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  And Tony Bobulinski did a great job explaining that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=179.1s)]
*  And I think that the American people will be very interested to read the transcripts [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=182.38s)]
*  when we release them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=185.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you, Jim Jordan, let's get your take on the developments today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=188.18s)]
*  And I'd like to know, I know that your colleague, Congressman Comer has demanded the DOJ turnover, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=192.34s)]
*  Joe Biden's classified documents. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=197.5s)]
*  I'd also like the records of all those pseudonym accounts, email accounts that he was using. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=199.7s)]
*  I'd like every single email he sent. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  I'd also like to take a look at Joe Biden's bank records. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  Is there any chance that that will get a hold of all of this so that maybe you can put this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  whole thing together? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Well what we really want now is we want the information Robert Herr has. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=219.38s)]
*  And they can't hide, the White House and the Justice Department can't hide behind the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=222.14s)]
*  fact that, oh, it's an ongoing investigation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=224.78s)]
*  The investigation's over. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=226.94s)]
*  We have a 300 and some page report from Special Counsel Herr. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=227.98s)]
*  We want those transcripts. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  We want that information. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  We want the video footage. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=234.62s)]
*  We want all that information as we go about doing our work. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=237.17999999999998s)]
*  To the other point, Sean, I mean, this is called the money, the business, the brand. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=241.7s)]
*  That's what was going on with the Biden family. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=246.98s)]
*  And the White House story has changed so many times. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=249.42s)]
*  First it was I never spoke to Hunter Biden about his business. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  Then it was I've never in business with Hunter Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=254.89999999999998s)]
*  And then of course Hunter Biden himself said my father wasn't financially involved. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=257.66s)]
*  We get the facts from all these witnesses. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=262.26000000000005s)]
*  And here's probably the best one we got a couple weeks ago from one of Hunter Biden's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  business associates. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  When Joe Biden shows up at the Four Seasons Restaurant for lunch, at the lunch are Hunter [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  Biden, his associates, and eight Chinese officials who are executives at CEFC, the Chinese energy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=274.18s)]
*  company. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden comes in, gives a short presentation and leaves. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  The deal gets closed and $3 million gets wired to Biden accounts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=284.98s)]
*  That's what was going on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=289.38s)]
*  The money, the business, the brand, which is what they were selling. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=290.38s)]
*  And Tony Bobolinski confirmed that today in his testimony. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=294.02s)]
*  The money, the business, the brand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=297.9s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=299.62s)]
*  You had Rob Walker, a former business associate of Hunter's. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=301.14s)]
*  He met with the chairman of CEFC, the Four Seasons in Washington. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=304.98s)]
*  Has that been confirmed? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=308.88s)]
*  And do you find both Mr. Walker and Tony Bobolinski? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=309.88s)]
*  Or Jim Jordan? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=313.62s)]
*  Do you find them to be credible witnesses for your case? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=314.62s)]
*  Well, at that luncheon, Tony Bobolinski wasn't there, but Rob Walker was. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Rob Walker, though, is the guy who wouldn't even tell us that the big guy was Joe Biden. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=324.22s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=328.06s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  But Tony Bobolinski obviously confirmed that the big guy on an email to Walker, to Hunter [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=330.38s)]
*  Biden, to all these folks who were doing business together, that the big guy was, in fact, Joe [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=335.5s)]
*  Biden. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski's story hasn't changed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=342.06s)]
*  The White House story has changed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  The Justice Department story has changed about how they handled the Hunter Biden investigation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  But like the whistleblowers, Tony Bobolinski's story has not wavered. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  He's just come forward with what he sees as the facts and he's presented them to the committee [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  and just as importantly, to the country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  And Congressman Smith, let's talk to you about Tony Bobolinski and the allegations that he [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  made and the things he testified to today, that he worked with Hunter Biden to create [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=366.7s)]
*  the joint venture Sino Hawk Holdings with CEFC, the Chinese energy conglomerate, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=371.58s)]
*  said that he met with Joe Biden in 2017 and that Joe Biden, quote, enabled his son Hunter [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=378.18s)]
*  to sell access to the United States to our most dangerous adversaries, including the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=384.22s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party, Russia and more, and that he had direct personal experience [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=390.7s)]
*  and it was clear that Joe Biden was the brand being sold by the Biden family. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=396.34s)]
*  What's your reaction to that testimony? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=402.06s)]
*  You know, Sean, that's exactly right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=404.58s)]
*  Today, Tony Bobolinski confirmed what the two IRS whistleblowers said months ago in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  WhatsApp messages that they they delivered to the House Ways and Means Committee that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=413.02s)]
*  said that Joe Biden is the brand and the family business is selling the brand all over the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  country to all these foreign different foreign entities like China, Russia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=423.14s)]
*  What's also interesting today is that Tony Bobolinski, Sean, said that he named the time, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=427.62s)]
*  the location where he sat down with Joe Biden for 45 minutes to talk about the relationship [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=435.14s)]
*  with the Chinese companies, Chinese government. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  And that was three years before Joe Biden stood up before the American people in a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=445.86s)]
*  debate saying that his son was not involved in any with any Chinese company. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=450.98s)]
*  Same question for all three of you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=457.94s)]
*  We are talking about the president of the United States that may have taken official [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  actions as vice president that benefited his family. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  We're talking about Joe Biden not only just lying to the American people, but enriching [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=469.06s)]
*  his family by doing deals with with some of our biggest geopolitical foes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=473.94s)]
*  Jim Jordan, I'll start with you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  Where does this end? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=483.3s)]
*  This is an impeachment inquiry here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  What would be you know, what are you looking at in terms of possible charges against Joe? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=487.3s)]
*  Well, potential obstruction, potential money laundering, potential bribery. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=493.94s)]
*  Those are what we're looking at. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=497.06s)]
*  We got two more witnesses. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=497.94s)]
*  Jim Biden next week, Hunter Biden the following week will depose those. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=499.06s)]
*  We'll see what they bring forward. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=502.66s)]
*  But I think in the end, it's a tale as old as time. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  Politician does certain things. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=506.74s)]
*  Those actions benefit his family financially. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=508.42s)]
*  And then there's an effort to cover it up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=510.82000000000005s)]
*  And we would have never known about the cover up, but for the brave whistleblowers. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=512.5s)]
*  But we got to complete our investigation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=515.7s)]
*  Then we'll decide. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=517.38s)]
*  You said over 20 million. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  What crimes do you possibly see here or impeachable offenses? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=521.22s)]
*  Do you see James Comer? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden to me looks like he's violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  In that act, it defines what constitutes a bribe. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=532.98s)]
*  And certainly, if you look at while he was vice president, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=536.02s)]
*  the gifts that his son and brother received certainly meet the definition of bribery. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  So that's certainly a problem. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=546.74s)]
*  Jim Jordan mentioned the obvious with the six different banks [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=548.5s)]
*  implied in their suspicious activity reports that there was money laundering, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=552.26s)]
*  tax evasion, tax fraud, wire fraud. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=555.62s)]
*  I think with the president's brother, there's securities fraud. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=558.1s)]
*  So it's a pretty long list. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=561.14s)]
*  Like Representative Jordan said, we're going to be hopefully getting the two final depositions [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=563.38s)]
*  together with the Biden family members, and then we'll proceed from there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  Might you, might you, may, are you thinking about maybe sending a subpoena to Joe Biden? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=574.74s)]
*  Well, we'll see where everything leads. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=582.82s)]
*  But he's certainly a key player in this, obviously. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=584.82s)]
*  We've learned from some of the previous interviews that we've conducted. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=588.98s)]
*  That there may be some more suspicious activity and another maybe account that was unknown. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=593.22s)]
*  So we're requesting information on that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=598.9s)]
*  We're taking steps needed to issue subpoenas that will win in court. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=601.14s)]
*  Jason, what impeachable offenses are you looking at? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=607.14s)]
*  Well, Sean, if you just look, Joe Biden, the Biden family, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=610.82s)]
*  has been cashing in his position of power in government. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=614.5s)]
*  We have numerous examples of witnesses who have said that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=618.9s)]
*  The IRS whistleblowers have highlighted evidence of that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=622.9s)]
*  Joe Biden's going to go down as the most corrupt, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=626.26s)]
*  compromised president in our lifetime. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=629.14s)]
*  Prediction. Will Joe Biden, as a result of the three of you and your independent [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=632.74s)]
*  investigations, be impeached? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=637.38s)]
*  Do you believe that'll happen, Jim Jordan? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=639.3s)]
*  We got to wait till the evidence is done. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=643.06s)]
*  We got to see where our colleagues are. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=644.18s)]
*  But I think the case is pretty compelling. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  Jim Comer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=649.22s)]
*  I agree with Jim Jordan. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=650.74s)]
*  And Jason Smith. Last word. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=653.22s)]
*  I'm with Jim and Jamie. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  All right. Three for three. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  We'll be watching very closely and reporting every detail. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHxp1lPJG0&t=659.4599999999999s)]
