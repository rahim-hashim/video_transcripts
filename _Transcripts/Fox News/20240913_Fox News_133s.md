# Kristi Noem: Debating Kamala Harris is a ‘waste of time’
**Fox News:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ)
*  Joining us now is South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, your take on all this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=3.02s)]
*  Well, you know, Sean, if there was ever a candidate that needed to be vetted, it's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=9.98s)]
*  She didn't get a single vote. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=10.98s)]
*  Not a single person in this country actually voted for her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=11.98s)]
*  So we need to know what she believes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=14.38s)]
*  She doesn't do interviews. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=16.14s)]
*  She doesn't talk to the press. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=17.38s)]
*  And then in this debate, she never revealed what she actually has for policy positions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=19.26s)]
*  There's nothing on her campaign website that says what her policies are. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=24.34s)]
*  So if anybody needed to be vetted, it's her. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=27.24s)]
*  And I admire President Trump for not debating her again. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=30.48s)]
*  He is recognizing the fact that it is a waste of time, that she is not going to say what [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=33.74s)]
*  she truly believes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=38.32s)]
*  She's not going to be truthful with the American people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=39.32s)]
*  And he's going to take his argument directly to families and to people that live in this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=40.96s)]
*  country that are impacted by her policies. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=44.92s)]
*  He's going to spend his time with real Americans that are struggling under this economy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=46.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=51.0s)]
*  What do you think the best way to get out her radical statements and record is? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=52.56s)]
*  I mean, I put it up on my website, Hannity.com. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=56.46s)]
*  People, you know, it's a public service. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=58.82s)]
*  You can share it with friends, family, neighbors, you know, co-workers and social media. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  It seems to be it seems to now be penetrating into the consciousness of Americans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=66.38s)]
*  Do you believe that's the case? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=72.5s)]
*  People are understanding how extreme she is, radical she is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=73.7s)]
*  I think they are. And what's powerful is watching her own lips say the words of what she [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=78.66s)]
*  truly does believe. Jim Clyburn was right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=84.3s)]
*  She's she believes something different. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=86.84s)]
*  And if we let her talk too long, she the truth will come out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=88.68s)]
*  They have coached her into these policy positions to get her elected. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=91.84s)]
*  But if she keeps talking, she's going to forget and she's going to say what she truly does [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=94.92s)]
*  believe. So it is powerful when you see a video of her saying what her former positions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=99.04s)]
*  were or what they are today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=104.56s)]
*  Those clips that you just played, I think are incredibly powerful. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  I think everybody in this country should see those. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=109.0s)]
*  Well, we're going to try and get it if people want to download it, share it with their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=112.0s)]
*  friends and family as a public service. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=115.4s)]
*  It's on Hannity dot com. Governor Noem, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKW6t9h9iqQ&t=117.26s)]
