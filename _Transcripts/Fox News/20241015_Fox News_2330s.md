# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 14, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY)
*  The Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Columbus Day, everybody. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, this is a day that commemorates the discoveries [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=4.38s)]
*  and daring spirit of Christopher Columbus. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=6.88s)]
*  Now, it's a figure that is revered especially [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=10.02s)]
*  by Italian Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But of course, as they do with every American tradition, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  the left and Kamala Harris want to destroy this day [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=17.86s)]
*  and shame all of us for celebrating. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=21.36s)]
*  Remember this, Jim. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=24.12s)]
*  It is an honor, of course, to be with you this week [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=26.3s)]
*  as we celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=29.48s)]
*  as we speak truth about our nation's history. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=36.88s)]
*  for tribal nations, perpetrating violence, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=40.88s)]
*  stealing land, and spreading disease. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=44.92s)]
*  We must not shy away from this shameful past. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, of course, Trump, he's sticking with Chris. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=53.32s)]
*  His memory stands as an enduring testament [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=57.34s)]
*  to the daring spirit that built our great civilization. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=60.14s)]
*  And as long as I have anything to say about this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=64.38000000000001s)]
*  and I hope that's going to be a long time, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=67.18s)]
*  it will always be Columbus Day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And that is a perfect encapsulation [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=71.78s)]
*  of where we are as a nation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=77.28s)]
*  and the choice that's before us in 22 days. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=79.12s)]
*  So which way is it, America? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=85.22s)]
*  All right, over the weekend, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=87.34s)]
*  Elon Musk's team of aerospace engineers and physicists [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=91.34s)]
*  managed to pull off two high-risk, dramatic feats. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=94.9s)]
*  First, SpaceX launched a massive, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  super-heavy Starship rocket, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=100.94s)]
*  which in and of itself was incredible to watch. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  But what happened after was truly mind-blowing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=106.86s)]
*  Now, the first stage of the rocket [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=110.28s)]
*  landed back on the launch pad [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  with the help of a gargantuan mechanical arm [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=114.5s)]
*  and a cool pincer-type move. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=118.76s)]
*  We have successfully putt the super-heavy booster [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=121.56s)]
*  back at the launch tower. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=134.86s)]
*  What a reprieve of life! [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=137.86s)]
*  Literally, the tower caught the rocket, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=140.62s)]
*  as Elon Musk tweeted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=143.66s)]
*  And then the other objective perfectly achieved [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=145.42s)]
*  was the spectacular belly flop splashdown [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=148.38s)]
*  right on target in the Indian Ocean Sunday morning [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=152.14s)]
*  after the successful test flight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  Starship is on target, approaching landing burn startup. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=157.66s)]
*  Landing burn startup. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=161.06s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=162.42s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=163.26s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=164.1s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=164.94s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=165.78s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=166.62s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=167.46s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=168.3s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=169.14s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=169.98s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=170.82s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=171.66s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=172.5s)]
*  You can see the water just behind the ship. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=173.38s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=177.26s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=178.1s)]
*  Oh! [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a rocket. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=183.76s)]
*  An incredible view. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's safe to say we have a ship in the water. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=188.0s)]
*  Ha ha! [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=191.7s)]
*  Touchdown! [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=193.82s)]
*  I don't know if it was like this for you, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=195.54s)]
*  but I could not get enough of this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=197.26s)]
*  It was absolutely awe inspiring. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=199.22s)]
*  And that was after Musk unveiled his RoboTaxi prototype [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=201.74s)]
*  and his plans for a new Tesla robot last Thursday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=206.62s)]
*  It can be a teacher, babysit your kids. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=211.12s)]
*  It can walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  just be your friend, serve drinks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=217.9s)]
*  I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  Now Elon Musk's success in innovation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  would not have been possible in a socialist country, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=231.66s)]
*  but it's possible here, at least for now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=235.22s)]
*  But in states like California, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=238.66s)]
*  this type of spectacular risk taking and investment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=240.18s)]
*  is becoming increasingly more difficult. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=243.5s)]
*  Now we all know that Elon Musk already announced [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=246.7s)]
*  his move of X and SpaceX from the Golden State [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=248.9s)]
*  where both companies were founded. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=252.34s)]
*  But the corporate exodus from California [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  has been going on for years [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=256.74s)]
*  as other states like Texas, Tennessee, Florida, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=258.86s)]
*  South Dakota, the list goes on, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=262.58s)]
*  have been over backwards [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=264.54s)]
*  to create much friendlier business climates. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=265.78s)]
*  At its best, our capitalist system encourages risk taking [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=269.5s)]
*  and rewards smart innovation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=273.14s)]
*  It doesn't punish success with burdensome regulations [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=274.82s)]
*  or a crushing tax regime. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=278.46s)]
*  Now check out the top states for doing business [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=281.34s)]
*  in 2024 by one survey. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=283.76s)]
*  So what do nine out of 10 of them have in common? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=286.3s)]
*  Republican governors. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  But Harris and the Democrats, they have other priorities [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  beyond just growing an economy or innovation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=298.1s)]
*  Well, they have climate change, of course, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  that's their religion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=302.5s)]
*  And then they want to wokeify everything we do, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=303.74s)]
*  everywhere we do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=307.74s)]
*  And when you need to get rockets up in the air [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=310.1s)]
*  and cars on the road that are self-driving, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=311.94s)]
*  the last thing you should be thinking about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=314.06s)]
*  is racial or ethnic quotas in hiring. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=316.3s)]
*  You should never be thinking about that anyway. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=318.1s)]
*  Hiring the best and most talented people is Musk's hallmark. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=320.18s)]
*  Now as the most innovative force in America today, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=325.38s)]
*  it is fitting that Musk is working hard [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=327.86s)]
*  to get Trump reelected. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=330.14s)]
*  He knows that to be a country [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=332.0s)]
*  where greatness can still happen, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=333.66s)]
*  where the American dream is still possible, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=335.86s)]
*  we have to protect our sacred rights. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=338.16s)]
*  We have to respect our constitution. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=341.38s)]
*  And yes, our traditions matter. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=343.6s)]
*  We need to give our people a reason [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  to celebrate the American spirit, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=347.92s)]
*  as millions did over the weekend, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=350.0s)]
*  watching these incredible advances in space travel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=351.88s)]
*  Now, of course, liberals are used to having [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  all the billionaires on their side. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=358.04s)]
*  So they've been on a tear against Musk [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=359.56s)]
*  since he spent, what, $44 billion to buy Twitter [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=361.88s)]
*  and restore free speech to the platform. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=364.70000000000005s)]
*  And with his endorsement of Trump, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=367.44s)]
*  now they treat the man who is really [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=369.22s)]
*  the Thomas Edison of our age, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=371.36s)]
*  just like they treat Trump, like a dictator in waiting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  You are electing Elon Musk [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=377.24s)]
*  if you are also electing Donald Trump. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  You're getting the richest guy in the world [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=380.36s)]
*  who controls a major social media platform. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=382.04s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=385.76s)]
*  What a blowhard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=387.32s)]
*  Dangerous, Donnie. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=388.8s)]
*  Well, none of these people seem to think it's dangerous [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=390.56s)]
*  when major forces on Wall Street and Silicon Valley [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=393.04s)]
*  own Kamala Harris. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  A few weeks ago, she hauled in a staggering [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=398.32s)]
*  $27 million at a soiree in Manhattan, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=400.12s)]
*  attended by big money from hedge funders [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=403.32s)]
*  and investment bankers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=405.76s)]
*  Now, even the New York Times today had to concede [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=407.76s)]
*  that big business is pulling her strings. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=410.54s)]
*  Now, here's the reality of the situation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=414.12s)]
*  Harris is controlled by the people [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=416.48s)]
*  who want to maintain the status quo. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=419.12s)]
*  And look, she and they want things to say the same, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=422.64s)]
*  just as they are. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=426.76s)]
*  Remember, they all think Obama did a great job. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=428.26s)]
*  They think Joe Biden did a great job. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=430.5s)]
*  They think Dick Cheney did a great job. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  That's why the Old Guard globalists are all supporting her. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=435.38s)]
*  Now, we've been governed by this bipartisan oligarchy [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=439.74s)]
*  for most of the past 25 years or so. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=442.42s)]
*  We've spent trillions on wars we did not win. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=445.28s)]
*  We've lost tens of thousands [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=448.68s)]
*  of our American patriots along the way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=450.9s)]
*  We've lost millions of jobs to outsourcing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=453.38s)]
*  But if you think it worked out well for the working class, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=457.2s)]
*  definitely Kamala is your gal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  But most voters, and you look at the surveys, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=463.36s)]
*  they're staggering. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=465.8s)]
*  They think the economy stinks. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=466.96s)]
*  Inflation has been crushing to American families, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=469.24s)]
*  a 25 to 30% hit on most of them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  It is nightmarish economically [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=476.9s)]
*  compared to where most of our citizens were pre-pandemic, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=478.84s)]
*  when Donald Trump was in charge. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=482.26s)]
*  And it's hugely stressful for parents [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=484.28s)]
*  and single people alike. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=486.84s)]
*  But if you believe that we can do better, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=489.11999999999995s)]
*  that our country can do better, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  that we can have higher wages for the middle class [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  and a higher standard of living for Americans, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  then you're gonna support Trump [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  and you'll ignore the incessant propaganda [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=499.88s)]
*  from now until November 5th. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=502.26s)]
*  And it is heating up. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=503.76s)]
*  We'll get into that a little bit later on. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, remember when they said [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=507.76s)]
*  that Trump was gonna start all those wars, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=508.82s)]
*  when he'd crash the economy, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  in 2015, 2016? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=512.92s)]
*  Well, of course he did the opposite. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=514.88s)]
*  Back then, just as now, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  they're trying to scare you all away [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=519.38s)]
*  from embracing a more America-focused [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  economic and foreign policy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=523.12s)]
*  But historians are gonna judge this campaign, I think, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  100 years from now, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=528.8s)]
*  as an inflection point in American history. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  If Trump is re-elected, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=533.24s)]
*  this will be seen as a time [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=535.0s)]
*  when Americans took their country back, again, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=536.68s)]
*  from the incompetent, bloated, corrupt forces [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=539.64s)]
*  that have run us into the ground for decades, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=542.78s)]
*  and that they returned it and turned us to a period [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=545.74s)]
*  when we still believed we were a noble nation [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=549.0s)]
*  with an amazing history, not perfect, but still amazing, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=551.4599999999999s)]
*  and that we can still do great things. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=554.78s)]
*  Musk believes that with his whole heart. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=558.1s)]
*  Trump and Vance obviously believe that, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  which is why they're running. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=563.26s)]
*  But the question is, do enough voters believe it? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=565.66s)]
*  Or have they gotten so beaten down, so beaten up, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=569.68s)]
*  and so intimidated that they've given up? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=573.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=577.36s)]
*  From the national pride and amazement about SpaceX, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=579.08s)]
*  and the enthusiasm, and the patriotism and love [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=582.6s)]
*  that you're seeing at all these Trump rallies, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=586.68s)]
*  including in California over the weekend, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm betting that enough Americans still believe [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=591.4s)]
*  the best is yet to come. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=594.04s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=596.2s)]
*  Democrats haven't felt this badly [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=597.36s)]
*  since Biden bombed the debate. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=599.04s)]
*  The party is leaking like crazy. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=600.88s)]
*  Anxiety, despair is the mood in Washington. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=603.36s)]
*  The Harris campaign is stuck in the mud. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=606.92s)]
*  And behind the scenes, Democrats are worried she's stalled, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=609.6s)]
*  and her so-called lead has evaporated. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=613.62s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris had a five-point lead [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=617.08s)]
*  in our last poll taken a month ago, right after the debate. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=619.76s)]
*  That lead has all but evaporated, Willie. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=623.22s)]
*  Take a look at this new head-to-head matchup. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=626.32s)]
*  48% to 48%, that is what we call a deadlocked race. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=629.12s)]
*  At this point in the election, Hillary was up seven, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=635.24s)]
*  Biden was up nine. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=638.6s)]
*  The betting markets of Trump's chance of winning [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  is better than 50-50, and the battlegrounds are all tied up. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=642.6s)]
*  So if the polls are as wrong as they usually are, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=647.88s)]
*  we could know the winner on election night. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  Democrats are jittery, Trump's numbers are historic. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=652.92s)]
*  In the bottom line is this, at this particular hour, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  if you believe the polling, Donald Trump's gonna put up [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=660.18s)]
*  the best performance with black voters [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=662.56s)]
*  since Richard Nixon back in 1960, not 68 since 1960, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=664.3399999999999s)]
*  that's 64 years ago. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  Among Hispanic voters, Donald Trump's gonna put up [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=669.76s)]
*  the best performance for Republicans [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=671.68s)]
*  since 2004 in George W. Bush. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=673.4799999999999s)]
*  The media's preparing for the worst. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=675.68s)]
*  They're wargaming a Trump sweep. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=677.68s)]
*  Newsweek is even throwing around the L word, mm-hmm, landslide. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=680.7s)]
*  Three weeks until election day, and it's already started, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=685.7800000000001s)]
*  the panicked phone calls. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=689.5s)]
*  In certain Wilmington and greater concern [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=692.9000000000001s)]
*  amongst Democratic elected officials, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=695.58s)]
*  who I hear from daily asking me what I know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=697.82s)]
*  because they know I know some stuff, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=700.58s)]
*  and telling me explicitly and through their questions, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=702.32s)]
*  they are worried, okay? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  Doesn't mean she won't win, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=708.1800000000001s)]
*  but that's how we head into the weekend, okay? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=709.66s)]
*  Democrats are worried about where things stand. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  Democrat insiders are growing worried [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=715.02s)]
*  that the euphoria over Harris's entry into the race [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=716.78s)]
*  hasn't translated. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=720.1s)]
*  They say she hasn't given voters enough reason to vote for, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  and she's feeling the pressure. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=726.26s)]
*  Barack sent her on a media blitz, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  and she said she was no different than Biden. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=730.3s)]
*  And now the Harris campaign is changing strategies again. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=733.18s)]
*  After snubbing the Fox debate, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=737.12s)]
*  now Kamala is gonna be sitting down [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=739.3s)]
*  with Brett Baer this Wednesday. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=740.9399999999999s)]
*  All week, Kamala is gonna be playing defense. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=743.78s)]
*  She'll be campaigning only in Pennsylvania, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=746.5s)]
*  Wisconsin, and Michigan. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=749.2199999999999s)]
*  Her map is shrinking, but she claims she has faith. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=751.3s)]
*  It is easy in these moments of crisis to question our faith, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=756.3s)]
*  to sometimes lose our faith for a moment, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=761.06s)]
*  because what we see is so hard to see [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=764.02s)]
*  that we lose faith or a vision of those things [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=767.7s)]
*  we cannot see but must know. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=770.62s)]
*  I don't know what she just said. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=772.82s)]
*  So after calling on the Messiah [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=774.34s)]
*  to scold wavering black men, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=776.0200000000001s)]
*  Democrats are letting loose the comeback kid. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  But there's one problem. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  Nobody recognizes them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  Hi. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=785.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh! [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=788.38s)]
*  You don't? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=790.72s)]
*  Oh, you gotta like it! [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=795.46s)]
*  Oh, look at that, y'all. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=797.02s)]
*  All white guys look alike, I know. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=805.14s)]
*  And after Bill Clinton got shortchanged at McDonald's, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=808.38s)]
*  he sabotaged her campaign at a rally. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=811.72s)]
*  We'll have more on that later. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=813.92s)]
*  But Democrats think someone else [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=815.78s)]
*  is sabotaging her campaign. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=817.54s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=820.02s)]
*  Insiders believe that Biden still holds resentment [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  over how he was forced out, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=824.78s)]
*  and he wants to remind people who's the boss. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=827.28s)]
*  Now, just on Friday, he told Harris to hush up. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=830.08s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=833.84s)]
*  well, we're gonna have to, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=840.0s)]
*  I know I'm gonna go to the vice president in a second. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=841.92s)]
*  She's my boss here. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=844.76s)]
*  That's a true piece of. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=847.04s)]
*  We're gonna be, hang out in a second, man, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=851.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=855.68s)]
*  10 sources, 10, tell Axios that the relationship [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=857.28s)]
*  between Kamala's campaign and the White House [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=861.16s)]
*  has been increasingly fraught and awkward. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=863.52s)]
*  Senior Biden aides are still wounded by the coup. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=866.56s)]
*  NBC says Biden personally was stung [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=870.56s)]
*  when Harris used the I'm not Joe Biden line at the debate. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=873.72s)]
*  Now Harris insiders say they need to grow up. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=877.08s)]
*  They're too much in their feelings. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=880.22s)]
*  But they hate that Biden keeps big footing them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=882.5s)]
*  One person in the middle of it says, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=885.24s)]
*  the White House is lacking someone in the room [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=887.26s)]
*  thinking first and foremost about how things [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=889.38s)]
*  would affect the campaign. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=892.26s)]
*  You know, Biden might wanna let Kamala know [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=894.58s)]
*  that Israel is gonna bomb Iran at any minute. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=896.58s)]
*  Just a heads up, Madam Vice President, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=899.2800000000001s)]
*  don't want this to be a surprise. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=901.98s)]
*  And Harris's handlers are pressuring her [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=904.6600000000001s)]
*  to throw Joe under the bus [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=906.98s)]
*  and do whatever she needs to do to win. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=909.02s)]
*  But Kamala can't do it [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=911.78s)]
*  because she's been a machine politician her whole life. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=913.78s)]
*  And she's only gotten ahead by kissing up to the party boss. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=916.98s)]
*  Even though she's kind of the party boss herself now, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=920.86s)]
*  she knows she didn't earn it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=924.26s)]
*  So she can't act like a boss. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=925.88s)]
*  And she's scared of blasting Biden, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=928.26s)]
*  even if it helps her win, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=930.68s)]
*  because no one Fs with the Biden. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=932.74s)]
*  Any Democrat who's gone against Joe didn't last long. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=935.1s)]
*  Look at Gold bar Bob, look at Eric Adams. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=938.9s)]
*  So the longer she stays loyal, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=942.26s)]
*  the more likely it is she'll lose. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=944.56s)]
*  And if she throws him under the bus, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=947.28s)]
*  then Joe goes after her to no win. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=950.22s)]
*  Name something that you keep in your glove compartment. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=953.18s)]
*  Oh, DP Harris. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=955.9s)]

*  Yeah, uh-huh. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=969.62s)]
*  And we had a second mother too. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=970.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, did that mother have a glove compartment? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=972.0999999999999s)]
*  A small business owner named Miss Shelton. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=974.66s)]
*  Okay, we got that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=977.9s)]
*  Something that you keep in your glove compartment. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=978.8599999999999s)]

*  Oh. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=983.54s)]

*  and the media has been given the green light to ridicule her [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=987.02s)]
*  and they keep going, watch. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=990.6999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, that's a question I scream into my pillow every morning. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1002.22s)]
*  Kamala raised a billion dollars in three months [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1007.02s)]
*  and she's still the underdog. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  If Trump had that money, he could win California. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1012.38s)]

*  Douglas McKinnon in The Hill says, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1022.58s)]
*  Democrats have come to the realization [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1024.18s)]
*  that Harris is simply not a very good candidate. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1026.46s)]
*  She lacks confidence and is seemingly terrified [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1029.3400000000001s)]
*  to take any unrehearsed or unvetted policy questions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1032.4s)]

*  An administration so bad [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1040.9s)]
*  that the party wouldn't let the president run for reelection [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1043.1000000000001s)]
*  because it'd be a guaranteed wipeout. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1046.9s)]
*  And now the party's fighting with each other [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1049.9s)]
*  because they nominated a far left San Francisco politician [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1052.0600000000002s)]
*  out of step with regular Americans. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1055.46s)]

*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are only 22 days away [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1078.54s)]
*  from the election. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1081.54s)]
*  The panic on the left is palpable. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1082.58s)]
*  The poll numbers are not good for Kamala Harris. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1085.06s)]
*  However, I urge every voter to assume [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1087.58s)]
*  that your sole vote will decide this election. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1091.02s)]
*  In other words, take nothing for granted. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1094.1s)]
*  But now in a last-ditch effort to win over voters, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1096.54s)]
*  the Harris campaign, this is getting very interesting. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1099.22s)]
*  They are trying out two very desperate measures. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1102.18s)]
*  One, the first includes more public events [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1105.42s)]
*  for the Democratic candidate [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1108.22s)]
*  who's been in hiding for 84 days. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1109.46s)]
*  And as you can imagine, it is not going well at all. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1111.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1114.88s)]
*  You know, there's this whole, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  I talked with somebody once who said, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1117.48s)]
*  you know, if you just look at where the stars are [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1119.2s)]
*  in the sky, don't look at them as just random things. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1123.48s)]
*  If you just look at them as points, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1127.64s)]
*  look at the constellation, what does it show you? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1129.38s)]
*  So you just outlined it, Roland. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1132.42s)]
*  What does it show you? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  That the cities that he picks on [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1136.68s)]

*  Stars in the sky, beautiful. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1145.2s)]
*  Let's state the obvious. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a terrible candidate. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1149.5800000000002s)]
*  Her running mate, well, it's just as bad if not worse. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1151.5200000000002s)]
*  She does not connect with voters, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1154.6000000000001s)]
*  especially without a teleprompter. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  That is why Kamala has been in hiding. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1158.3600000000001s)]
*  That is why her surrogates are so important to her campaign. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1161.2s)]
*  Now, this brings us to the second desperate measure [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1166.0s)]
*  that the Harris campaign is now employing here. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1169.68s)]
*  A full-corp press featuring all of Kamala Harris's top allies. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1173.1599999999999s)]
*  But so far, that strategy has been a disaster. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1177.52s)]
*  First, campaign co-chair Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  She had to finally apologize for that bizarre video [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1184.4799999999998s)]
*  that many believe was a cheap attempt [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1188.6799999999998s)]
*  at mocking Holy Communion. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1191.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1193.52s)]
*  Love you, I do. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1195.4399999999998s)]
*  Need you, no matter what I do. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  And then Whitmer spent the next several days [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1202.16s)]
*  claiming, no, this was merely a promotion [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1205.2s)]
*  for semiconductor chips, and now has finally been forced [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1207.42s)]
*  to apologize for offending Catholics and other Christians. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  And at the same time, another Harris surrogate, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1215.6200000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1218.2s)]
*  Didn't look like he really wanted to be in Pennsylvania [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1219.48s)]
*  before the speech. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1221.76s)]
*  Only seemed to enjoy bashing Trump, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1222.68s)]
*  which is the left's obsession. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1224.88s)]
*  And there, he was scolding African-American men, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1226.8200000000002s)]
*  even accusing them of sexism. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1230.04s)]
*  Listen. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1233.24s)]
*  We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1234.72s)]
*  in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  as we saw when I was running. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1245.24s)]
*  Now, I also want to say that that seems to be [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1249.92s)]
*  more pronounced with the Brutus. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1255.96s)]
*  When I'm speaking to men directly, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1259.24s)]
*  part of it makes me think that, well, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1261.72s)]
*  you just aren't feeling the idea [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1264.72s)]
*  of having a woman as president. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1266.88s)]
*  And you're coming up with other alternatives [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1269.68s)]
*  and other reasons for that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1271.52s)]
*  Oh, maybe you're against women. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1273.48s)]
*  Wow, those condescending remarks [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1275.8s)]
*  were not received well at all. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1277.64s)]
*  Far left activist, Nina Turner, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1279.4s)]
*  even accused Obama of, quote, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1281.52s)]
*  blaming black men for the Democratic Party's failures. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1283.4s)]
*  The Very Liberal, New York Magazine, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1286.92s)]
*  calling it, quote, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1288.72s)]
*  Barack Obama's tiresome condescension towards black men. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1289.68s)]
*  An op-ed in the Washington Post referred to Obama [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  as the scolder in chief [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1297.3200000000002s)]
*  and advised the Harris campaign to, quote, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1299.5600000000002s)]
*  steer clear of Obama's instinct for, quote, tough love. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  So after a heavy dose of judgment from the former president, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  in this case, Obama, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1310.2s)]
*  well, Harris' campaign continues with more surrogates, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1311.68s)]
*  but equally insulting tactics. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1314.88s)]
*  Harris is now promising a handout [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1317.2s)]
*  and cold hard cash up to 20 grand. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1320.2s)]
*  Inforgivable loan forgiveness, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1322.92s)]
*  loans that are only available to black entrepreneurs [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1326.6000000000001s)]
*  that they would be the only ones able [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1329.88s)]
*  or eligible to receive it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  She, remember, also wants to pay off student loans, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1333.0800000000002s)]
*  and she's vowing to help African Americans [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1336.32s)]
*  invest in cryptocurrency. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1338.4s)]
*  And she's calling for marijuana to be legalized. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1340.56s)]
*  But when you think of the pandering [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1344.0800000000002s)]
*  and you think it can't get any worse, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1346.92s)]
*  you know, well, think back. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1349.04s)]
*  She wants to, is this kind of like a vote buying scheme [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1350.4s)]
*  when you want to pay off student loans [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  for young people that you call stupid? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1355.16s)]
*  Or is it $25,000 down payments for your first home [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1357.24s)]
*  or $50,000 for other businesses? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1361.44s)]
*  Or what about her running mate, Tim Walz, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1364.16s)]
*  trying to win over male voters with sports and guns? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  Because on Friday during a quick trip [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1370.44s)]
*  to a high school football game, you know, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1372.64s)]
*  where Walz was a assistant volunteer coach [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1375.12s)]
*  that kind of claimed he was the coach, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1379.1999999999998s)]
*  was he was almost ignored by the entire crowd. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1381.12s)]
*  They gave him the silent treatment. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  And then on Saturday, Walz, he wanted to, you know, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1386.2399999999998s)]
*  show the world what a big Second Amendment guy he was, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1389.7199999999998s)]
*  and he brought out a shotgun and he went pheasant hunting. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1392.8799999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  she wants mandatory gun buyback. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1397.52s)]
*  Some might call it confiscation. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1400.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, this was also a disaster for Walz. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1402.2s)]
*  He didn't seem to know how to load his own gun. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1405.4s)]
*  You decide. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1410.8400000000001s)]
*  And it never fits quite right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1411.68s)]
*  Never fits quite right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1413.04s)]
*  Just not quite right. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1414.68s)]
*  How do you give it back? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1415.52s)]
*  Governor, what kind of gun is it? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1418.04s)]
*  This is a Beretta A400. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1419.28s)]
*  I brought, I bought it when I was shooting a lot of trap [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1422.1200000000001s)]
*  because it has a kind of their patented thing, a kickoff. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1425.68s)]
*  So when you get old, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1428.92s)]
*  it doesn't hurt your shoulder as much. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1430.92s)]
*  It's probably been 15 years since I pulled that sucker out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1433.88s)]
*  Anyway, of course, this trip wasn't all about guns [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1437.04s)]
*  and hunting. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1439.48s)]
*  Walz also trying to connect with his fellow guy, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, pounding down a Diet Mountain Dew. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1443.96s)]
*  I prefer regular. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1447.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1448.6000000000001s)]
*  No, pen in. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1450.72s)]
*  Pen, pen. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1451.88s)]
*  That's why it's hunting, not shooting, right? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  You knew it, didn't you, man? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1455.44s)]
*  That's not on, off your right shoulder. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1456.8000000000002s)]
*  And I'm gonna grab a Diet Mountain Dew if we got one. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1458.72s)]
*  I'm gonna pound one down. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1461.32s)]
*  Now, if you think that Walz is bad, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1463.48s)]
*  just waiting to hear about the next campaign surrogate. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  Can't make this up either. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1468.0s)]
*  In another desperate attempt to win over men, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  the Harris campaign turned to Bill Clinton. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1472.2s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1474.6000000000001s)]
*  Good to see you, slick Willy. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1475.44s)]
*  I'm back all by myself. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1476.68s)]
*  Hillary's on vacation. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1478.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, slick Willy is not as slick [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1479.6000000000001s)]
*  as he used to be. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1482.08s)]
*  And today, we're trying to blame Trump [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1483.16s)]
*  for the border crisis, which was secure [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1485.24s)]
*  when they inherited it, and they bragged about [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1488.08s)]
*  for three years the border being closed, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1490.36s)]
*  the border being secure, and bragging about undoing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1492.28s)]
*  all the Trump border policies that brought us [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1495.32s)]
*  the lowest level of illegal immigration in decades. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton, unfortunately, kind of indicted [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1500.84s)]
*  the border czar, Kamala Harris, for not vetting [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1504.72s)]
*  the 12-plus million Harris-Biden illegals [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  from over 180 countries. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1511.08s)]
*  And Clinton says, oh no, no, I was taken out of context. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1513.28s)]
*  But as always, we report, you decide. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1516.76s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1519.48s)]
*  Listen to what he says about Lake O'Riordan. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1520.32s)]
*  Trump killed the bill. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1521.32s)]
*  The bill was written, being written, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1523.96s)]
*  by senior Republicans in the Senate. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1526.36s)]
*  And he killed the bill. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1530.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1535.0s)]
*  They made an ad about a young woman [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1537.36s)]
*  who'd been killed by an immigrant. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1540.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1543.28s)]
*  that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1545.44s)]
*  But if they all properly vetted, and that doesn't happen, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1548.68s)]
*  and America is not having enough babies [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1552.76s)]
*  to keep our populations up, so we need immigrants [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1556.0800000000002s)]
*  that have been vetted to do work, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  there wouldn't be a problem. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1563.96s)]
*  And he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1566.44s)]
*  The bill was not a border security bill. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1570.24s)]
*  Wouldn't have even kicked in unless four or 5,000 [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1573.32s)]
*  illegals first crossed into the country illegally. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1575.72s)]
*  And then they had the discretion of whether or not [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1578.32s)]
*  they would actually enforce the bill, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1581.24s)]
*  codifying their open borders policies. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1584.08s)]
*  He's not telling the truth. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1586.28s)]
*  An unvetted, harassed by an illegal immigrant [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1587.84s)]
*  is accused of murdering Lake and Riley [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1591.12s)]
*  the same month that the Democrats' so-called border bill [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1593.56s)]
*  was voted down in the Senate. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1597.24s)]
*  So, nice try. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1599.28s)]
*  That bill wouldn't do a thing to secure the border, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1601.0s)]
*  which they lied about and were telling us [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1603.76s)]
*  for three-plus years was secure, secure, and closed. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1605.8400000000001s)]
*  Instead, Harris and Biden, they wanted to use [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1610.4s)]
*  this phony border security bill to hire judges and bureaucrats [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1612.72s)]
*  to process their unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1616.4s)]
*  into the country faster. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1619.04s)]
*  Now, this was after more than 12 million [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1621.0s)]
*  already had poured into our country. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1623.16s)]
*  And while Harris, you know, the borders are, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1625.2s)]
*  looked on, did nothing, lied to the American people, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1627.8s)]
*  said the border's secure. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1630.84s)]
*  Thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, felons. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1632.4399999999998s)]
*  Now we have known terrorists in our country. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1635.76s)]
*  We don't know where they are, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1637.9599999999998s)]
*  but we know they have terror ties, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1638.9199999999998s)]
*  all because Joe and Kamala got rid of Trump's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1640.9599999999998s)]
*  successful border protections, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1644.28s)]
*  and they did it with a stroke of a pen on day one. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1646.1999999999998s)]
*  They didn't need a bill in the first place. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1648.48s)]
*  And that's why Trump just received a unanimous endorsement [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1650.56s)]
*  from the Border Patrol Union, and Kamala Harris didn't. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1654.48s)]
*  These are the people who see [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1657.96s)]
*  what has been going on firsthand. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1659.8000000000002s)]
*  And now as we approach a very important election, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1662.1200000000001s)]
*  responsible state governors like Glen Youngkin, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1664.8400000000001s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1667.96s)]
*  they have taken measures to clean illegal immigrants, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1669.76s)]
*  non-citizens that are not eligible to vote [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1673.48s)]
*  from the voter rolls. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1676.48s)]
*  In doing so, Glen Youngkin was enforcing a bill [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1677.96s)]
*  signed into law in 2006 by then-Governor Democrat [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1682.0s)]
*  Tim Kaine, you know, the guy that ran for Vice President, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1687.48s)]
*  requiring the state to maintain [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1691.0s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia's voter rolls, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1693.68s)]
*  but in a bizarre, crazy, insane twist, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1696.44s)]
*  well, the Harris-Biden pro-illegal immigrant administration, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1699.72s)]
*  you know, that now suddenly seems to care [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1703.72s)]
*  about border security, they're suing [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1705.52s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia, the state of Virginia, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1708.12s)]
*  to keep those illegal immigrants on the voter rolls. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1711.0s)]
*  And by the way, you need picture ID [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1714.84s)]
*  to get into the Democratic convention, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1717.2s)]
*  I know, because I went there, I know it was a heavy lift. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1718.96s)]
*  You need picture ID to get into a presidential [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1722.32s)]
*  or vice presidential debate or the White House. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1725.56s)]
*  Why not voting? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  Why are Democrats against voter ID, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1729.84s)]
*  signature verification, proof of citizenship? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1735.36s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1736.2s)]
*  I'd adore me too if I were you. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1741.2s)]
*  Happy Monday, everybody. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1744.8s)]
*  So in a viral clip, a McDonald's worker [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  actually mistook Bill Clinton for Joe Biden. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1749.12s)]
*  At first, Bill was disappointed until he realized [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1753.84s)]
*  this means he might be able to bang Dr. Jill. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1756.24s)]
*  Yeah, too old for him. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1762.04s)]
*  According to three new polls, Kamala Harris's campaign [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1764.56s)]
*  is falling rapidly behind Donald Trump. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  Also falling rapidly, Joe Biden. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1775.8s)]
*  But the Harris team is so depressed by these numbers [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1781.48s)]
*  that earlier today, Doug Emhoff [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  could barely have sex with a nanny. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1785.76s)]
*  Two of the things look so bad, Kamala has already [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1790.3999999999999s)]
*  sent her resume to her old employer. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1792.6s)]
*  Tim Walz went on a bird hunt this weekend, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1797.44s)]
*  although he had a little trouble loading his shotgun. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1799.76s)]
*  He defended himself saying it's different [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1803.52s)]
*  than the one he used when he shot Bin Laden. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1805.52s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1816.44s)]
*  And today was Columbus Day, which here in New York [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1819.32s)]
*  is now known as Indigenous Peoples Day, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1822.64s)]
*  or as Italians call it, oh, I got your [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1826.96s)]
*  indigenous holiday right here. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1829.76s)]

*  All right, I gotta calm down now. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1838.16s)]
*  The men of Chippendales have finally voted to unionize. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1841.1200000000001s)]

*  And finally, according to a new survey, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1851.0s)]
*  many adults believe that sex is over way too fast. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1852.68s)]
*  And for some adults, sex has never happened at all. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1857.3600000000001s)]

*  shaving Rachel Levine's legs. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1935.88s)]
*  Now the ad wasn't authorized by any candidate, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1939.0400000000002s)]
*  but it could have been paid for by Trump, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1941.64s)]
*  because it was about as authentic as Tim Walz's war record. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1943.8400000000001s)]
*  Although so-called voters were paid actors, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  and not typical actors either as far as I know, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1949.8s)]
*  none are successfully waiting tables. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1952.32s)]
*  Their film credits are rarer than fruit [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1955.08s)]
*  and Brian Stelter's lunch. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1957.0s)]
*  But some of those men were so effeminate [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1959.36s)]
*  they asked to be paid 80 cents on the dollar. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1961.0s)]
*  A sexist would say. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1964.6s)]
*  Not funny. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1968.8s)]
*  The message was that even real men can vote for Kamala, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1970.28s)]
*  which raises the question, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1974.28s)]
*  if these men are out there, then why make this commercial? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, would they need Kamala supporters [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1979.24s)]
*  to assure them it's okay? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1981.52s)]
*  It's like Kamala's your mom, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1983.6000000000001s)]
*  and she's giving you a note to give to your teacher [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1985.44s)]
*  saying it's okay for Billy to go on a field trip. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's just hope Coach Walz isn't on the bus. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1991.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you recall any ads telling someone [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1996.6000000000001s)]
*  it was okay to vote for Trump, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1998.0800000000002s)]
*  or to vote for anyone else for that matter? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1999.72s)]
*  Recall any ads from the 80s saying that real men [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2001.8s)]
*  are allowed to vote for Reagan? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2004.24s)]
*  He didn't need it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  He locked down votes for real men, real women, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2006.68s)]
*  even real chimps. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2008.96s)]
*  It's sad that you gotta prove [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2011.32s)]
*  these men are actually out there. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2014.2s)]
*  Kamala's campaign is like Bud Light [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2016.64s)]
*  trying to win back the alpha males who used to drink it, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  only this time instead of beer, it's the Democrat Party. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2021.04s)]
*  But the fact that you had to hire actors [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2024.16s)]
*  to pretend they're blue collar types who vote for Harris [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2025.92s)]
*  means there aren't any real ones. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2028.96s)]
*  Nope, Dems know that real men see through this bull. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2031.48s)]
*  After all, look at her husband and her VP. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2035.44s)]
*  They make Siegfried and Roy look like Ollie and Frasier. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2038.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2041.84s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2042.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2043.52s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2044.36s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2045.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2046.04s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2046.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh! [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2047.7199999999998s)]
*  It's getting sad at this point. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2048.56s)]
*  Listen to actress Jennifer Garner [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2050.04s)]
*  trying to assure male Kamala supporters [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2052.16s)]
*  that they're still men. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2055.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm looking at these beautiful faces, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2057.04s)]
*  these women and these strong men. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2059.2s)]
*  God, is there anything sexier than a man [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2061.08s)]
*  who is like men for Kamala? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2062.96s)]
*  Woo! [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2065.3199999999997s)]
*  Woo! [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2066.16s)]
*  Ha ha! [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2067.4s)]
*  Those men are just cheering because they want free Tampax. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2069.12s)]
*  That video made more scrotum shrink [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2074.04s)]
*  than a urologist with cold hands. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2076.0s)]
*  The only way Kamala voters are hot [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2079.56s)]
*  is if they're running a fever. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2082.56s)]
*  And frankly, you'd have to be delirious to vote for her. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2085.16s)]
*  And then there's Obama sensing trouble [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2087.84s)]
*  admonishing black men for not voting for her, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2089.6s)]
*  blaming it on sexism. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2091.48s)]
*  We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2093.88s)]
*  and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2099.1600000000003s)]
*  and communities as we saw when I was running. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2103.84s)]
*  I also want to say that that seems to be [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2106.84s)]
*  more pronounced with the brothers. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2109.8s)]
*  When you have a choice that is this clear, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2113.12s)]
*  part of it makes me think, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2116.6800000000003s)]
*  and I'm speaking to men directly, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2120.1600000000003s)]
*  part of it makes me think that, well, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2123.3199999999997s)]
*  you just aren't feeling the idea [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2125.68s)]
*  of having a woman as president. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2127.8399999999997s)]
*  There you go, you're sexist! [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2129.4s)]
*  I'm surprised he didn't nag them [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2133.16s)]
*  for not knowing which was their shrimp fork. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2134.44s)]
*  But Obama, shouldn't you be back on Martha's Vineyard, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2137.44s)]
*  you know, where the black population is roughly 3%? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2139.64s)]
*  If he wanted to twist some arms, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  he should have sent Michelle. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2144.2s)]
*  But meanwhile, as Dems launched commercials for castrados, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2148.64s)]
*  what was Elon Musk launching? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2151.84s)]
*  New line of robots, a sleek self-driving bus, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  and then a rocket, which he caught on the way down. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2156.92s)]
*  It's kind of amazing, I mean, think about it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2175.7200000000003s)]
*  Think about the physics. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2179.92s)]
*  I mean, that's like lifting Joy Behar into the stratosphere [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2182.2400000000002s)]
*  and then landing her on an aircraft carrier, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2185.7200000000003s)]
*  except lighter. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  But here's a guy who doesn't need to be told [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2190.6800000000003s)]
*  it's okay to do anything. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2192.2400000000002s)]
*  In fact, they tell him the opposite, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2193.84s)]
*  and yet, look what he gets done. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2195.2400000000002s)]
*  The man literally has a spaceship, and it works. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2197.32s)]
*  The people come back alive. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2200.64s)]
*  How many people in history could say that? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2202.0s)]
*  So if you're looking at men, which side appeals to you more, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2204.56s)]
*  a bunch of broke actors or a billionaire genius inventor. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2207.48s)]
*  Now when I watched that Harris ad, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2211.36s)]
*  I wasn't embarrassed about being a man, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2212.88s)]
*  because I'm not them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2214.84s)]
*  And when I see Musk, I'm not proud of being a man, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2216.28s)]
*  because I didn't do what he did, he did it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2218.96s)]
*  And that's it, it's about individuals, not the group. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2221.64s)]
*  It's the point that the Dems always miss, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2225.7200000000003s)]
*  which is why they need actors to play [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2228.04s)]
*  what they think are men, because they don't know [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2229.96s)]
*  what men are unless they're a group [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2232.48s)]
*  that they can herd like sheep. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2234.48s)]
*  And they embarrass themselves doing it, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2236.52s)]
*  like Tim Waltz trying to hunt. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2238.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2240.88s)]
*  That's my theory, and it never fits quite right. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2241.72s)]
*  It never fits quite right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2243.6s)]
*  It's not quite right, how do you give it that? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2245.44s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2247.16s)]
*  Governor, what kind of gun is it? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2248.48s)]
*  This is a Beretta A400. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2249.72s)]
*  I bought it when I was shooting a lot of travel, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2252.6s)]
*  because it has kind of their patented thing, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2256.12s)]
*  a kickoff, so when you get old, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2258.44s)]
*  it doesn't hurt your shoulder as much. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2261.4s)]
*  Oh, shut up! [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2263.12s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2264.68s)]
*  You know he doesn't know what he's doing [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2266.9199999999996s)]
*  when he's talking through it, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2268.08s)]
*  but it's nothing like those weapons of war [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2269.9199999999996s)]
*  he claimed he carried into battle, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2271.8799999999997s)]
*  which were actually gelato spoons [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2274.0s)]
*  while he was stationed in Italy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, that was worse than Liz Warren [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2278.72s)]
*  at trying to drink a beer, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2281.16s)]
*  or as her people call it, fire water. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2283.52s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2285.96s)]
