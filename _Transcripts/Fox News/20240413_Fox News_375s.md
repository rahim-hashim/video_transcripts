# Judge Jeanine: If you don't respect America, get out
**Fox News:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU)
*  reaction, the co-host of the hit show, The Five, our friend Judge Jeanine Pirro is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=0.0s)]
*  You know what infuriates me about all of this is, you know, we have Director Wray now for the third [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  time in a row, he appears before Congress, the threat has never been greater that this country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=12.88s)]
*  is about to be attacked again. Another 9-11. Okay. He's supposed to be the head of the top [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=18.8s)]
*  law enforcement agency in our country. We keep showing example after example of what illegal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=25.2s)]
*  immigrants are doing. They enter the country illegally, they get out in states, no bail laws, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  sanctuary states, they flip the bird, then they go to another sanctuary state and commit more crimes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=35.68s)]
*  All right. But he's warning about terror threats. And yet, if you're the chief law enforcement [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  officer of the FBI, why don't you go to the president of the United States and insist that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  he enforce the laws of this country so that maybe people from Afghanistan, Egypt, China, Russia, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=54.4s)]
*  Iran and Syria, maybe they'll stop coming in. I know I live in a fantasy world, right Judge, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  one where law and order would exist. Well, certainly Christopher Wray has gone before [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=67.2s)]
*  Congress. Congress can't do anything about this. The only person who can is Joe Biden. He refuses [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=72.8s)]
*  to. If he does anything at all, it'll be for the purpose of politics. Look, this Afghan individual [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=78.96s)]
*  came into this country during 2023, Joe Biden's term, and as part of Joe Biden's catch and release, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=85.44s)]
*  he's given an alternative to detention as if they take any of them into detention. And he's told, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=94.8s)]
*  listen, do us a favor, give us a call every now and then, let us know how you're doing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=100.88s)]
*  And in the meantime, you can apply for asylum. Within the year, he is roaming across the United [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=105.28s)]
*  States and the FBI finds out that this guy is part of a virulently anti-Western, anti-American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Islamic group. And so they tell ICE, you got to take him into custody. ICE takes him into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=118.56s)]
*  custody, takes him before an immigration judge, and these fools, these fools, I'm sorry, this is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=125.2s)]
*  like a kangaroo court. They don't tell the judge that we have connected him with the most virulent [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=131.68s)]
*  terrorist, anti-American terrorist group around because they say that's classified information. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=138.08s)]
*  And what they say to the judges, look, we think he's a flight risk. So the immigration judge, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=144.88s)]
*  whose name I cannot get, I've been trying all day to get the name of this judge because it's time we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=150.24s)]
*  identified who these judges are and what they're doing. The judge releases them and DHS, this is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=156.08s)]
*  Mayorkas's group, they say, we won't disclose what we told to the judge and we're limited in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=162.08s)]
*  what we can tell the judge. So what happens now is for the third time we go out last night and pick [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=167.68s)]
*  this guy up. This country is filled just this year with 170 connected to the terror watch list. Joe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Biden has created, as I've said many times, a globalist landing spot, which is nothing more than [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=182.64s)]
*  an area where people can come in for benefits. They can hate America, they can chant death to America, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  they can commit crimes in my old county of Westchester County. I was DA, head jurisdiction [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=196.32s)]
*  there. If those guys dare beat up the cops, if they dare try to give the cops a hard time in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=201.6s)]
*  preventing the cops from making an arrest, that wouldn't happen if I were the DA. But instead, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=208.4s)]
*  what they do is they release them and they're back to do it again. We're like suckers in a game. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=213.52s)]
*  Suckers is probably the right term. I mean, how did we become a country where we allow [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=220.8s)]
*  literally over 10 million people to come into our country illegally, we don't vet them, then we have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=226.72s)]
*  to pay for their food and their housing and their education and healthcare and the costs added to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=234.56s)]
*  the criminal justice system. Then they get arrested for beating up cops. Then they get let out because [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=239.84s)]
*  of no bail laws. Then they get to stay in a sanctuary city or state, flip us the bird, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=246.4s)]
*  and just go out and commit more crimes. And they get arrested again and again and again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=252.4s)]
*  And how stupid are we? How dumb are we? Because that's dumb to me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=256.88000000000005s)]
*  It is dumb. We're supposed to suck it all up and respect these migrants. They're not migrants. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=261.76000000000005s)]
*  They're illegals until they are recognized as citizens. You know what? The word illegal is in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=268.16s)]
*  the federal law 93 times. Illegal alien. Illegal alien. Yes, it's in there. That's what they are. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=274.24s)]
*  They're not migrants. And by the way, this guy who's with this terrorist group who hates America, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=279.92s)]
*  he is applying for asylum. How stupid are we? We've got to get rid of Joe Biden. We've got to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=286.08s)]
*  get rid of the progressive—they're not progressive. They are Marxist, leftist people who don't care [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=291.84s)]
*  about American citizens. And I'm tired of money going to illegals. I'm sorry, but it's got to go [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=298.24s)]
*  to senior citizens who pick up food in a supermarket and put it in their basket and then take it out [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=304.0s)]
*  again. It's got to go to our veterans. It's about time we had a president and a country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=309.04s)]
*  that respects the people who respect us. If you don't respect America, then get the hell out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=314.88s)]
*  You know, if it wasn't so serious, I'd make a joke and say, Judge, you get an F-minus [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=321.28s)]
*  from the wokeness police because you dared to say the word illegal. I'm sure you'll have to come [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=326.64s)]
*  back on Monday like Joe Biden after the State of the Union and say, oh, I regret saying illegal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=331.44s)]
*  Why don't you apologize for getting Lakin, not Lincoln, Riley's name wrong? That's where [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=337.6s)]
*  the apology should have been. Instead, he apologized to the murderer by calling—the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=343.12s)]
*  alleged murderer by calling him illegal, which is exactly what he is. We are living in a world [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=346.32s)]
*  where everything is upside down. Say it. Illegal. Illegal. All right. I got it. Take care. Judge, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=352.32s)]
*  okay, F-minus on the wokeness scale, but A-plus from the show. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p928EcR7lU&t=358.08s)]
