# Tomi Lahren: This concerns me
**Fox News:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus)
*  Here with reaction, former senior adviser to the Clintons, pollster Mark Penn, Fox News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=0.0s)]
*  contributor Ari Fleischer, and the host of Outkicks, Tommy Lahren, is fearless. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=5.08s)]
*  Tommy—Lahren is with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=9.44s)]
*  Tommy, I know—I guess these polls—you know, think about this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=11.28s)]
*  All these polls are coming out while Donald Trump is on trial every day, and it's getting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=15.76s)]
*  wall-to-wall coverage on some networks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=20.04s)]
*  And think about that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=23.48s)]
*  Every time they've arrested him, arraigned him, took a mugshot, it just backfires. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=24.52s)]
*  And his poll numbers go up, and the more times Joe goes out and speaks and he's had the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=29.88s)]
*  entire playing field to himself in terms of campaigning, well, he's not helping himself. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=34.56s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=40.12s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=41.12s)]
*  I would expect Donald Trump to be more ahead than he is right now, considering Joe Biden's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=44.24s)]
*  record, his inability to not only lead, but his inability to communicate or even stand [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  on his own. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=53.32s)]
*  So, I'm sorry, but I'm not as happy about the lead in the polls as maybe some are, because [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=54.32s)]
*  I think the lead should be far greater. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=58.6s)]
*  That also tells me the fact that the Democrats have yet to replace Joe Biden—I still think [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  they will—that they are very confident in their voting strategy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=64.08s)]
*  They are very confident in the mechanics of their voting—getting out the vote, mail-in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=67.4s)]
*  votes, ballot harvesting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=71.08s)]
*  They're very confident in their operation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=72.4s)]
*  So that concerns me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=74.92s)]
*  But I'll also say this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  When it comes to these young people and what they're doing on these college campuses, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=77.68s)]
*  I know it seems like it's a handful of misfits, and they might very well be in the minority [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=81.28s)]
*  now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=85.68s)]
*  But I do want to add on the future generations are not becoming any less communist, any less [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  pro-terror, anti-white, anti-freedom, anti-America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=90.4s)]
*  We've got generations coming up through our school system who are going to make the protests [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  now look small in comparison to what they could be in five or ten years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=98.04s)]
*  This is a lasting problem for the conservative movement, for the GOP, for the United States [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  in general. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=106.2s)]
*  The GOP has failed to get involved in the education system. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=107.2s)]
*  We have failed to get involved at the local level in our school boards and our city councils. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=110.48s)]
*  And so I fear that this isn't just a 200-day problem until the next election. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=115.4s)]
*  This is a 20-year problem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  Long after Joe Biden and Donald Trump are gone, we're going to have to contend with this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  younger voting bloc. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  So we better start now, because it's not enough to just scoff at them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=126.4s)]
*  They might not vote for Joe in November, but boy, I don't know if they're going to be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=129.28s)]
*  voting for Republicans anytime soon. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=132.8s)]
*  We've got to face that reality. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, they've been indoctrinated, you know, in these, quote, institutions of higher learning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=136.32s)]
*  Mark Penn, let me throw this to you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=142.24s)]
*  We have the leader of the free world now is basically incapable of leading, and he's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=145.4s)]
*  abdicated America's role on the world stage, and frankly, he's stabbing—you know, he's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=151.12s)]
*  surrendered in the war on terrorism, stabbing our ally Israel in the back in the process. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=156.48s)]
*  And these protests, you cannot tell me in any way politically helped Joe Biden. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=161.32s)]
*  Well, no, they're not. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=165.6s)]
*  They're not helping even the cause that they're protesting for, because most Americans [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=169.48s)]
*  look at these protests. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=174.12s)]
*  They don't see any American flags there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=175.12s)]
*  They see quite the opposite, that they seem to be anti-American, anti-Israel, some of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  them even pro-Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=183.52s)]
*  And it's really backfiring. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=186.12s)]
*  There's been no change in American support for Israel and for getting the hostages out [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  and for getting Hamas out of Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  And that has not changed, even though these things have gone on. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=195.52s)]
*  But the more Joe Biden caters to the base of the party and to these demonstrators, his [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=199.48s)]
*  rating on this issue goes down, not up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=205.44s)]
*  I think he's made a major miscalculation there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=208.2s)]
*  The swing voters are looking for world leadership, and that means standing up to terrorists. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=212.04s)]
*  That means hanging tough. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=217.5s)]
*  That means solving some of these problems in the Mideast. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=219.22s)]
*  And they don't see that yet. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=222.4s)]
*  Now, look, a lot can happen, but that is not what the American voters are seeing today. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=223.4s)]
*  And you're seeing these polls that were closing going the other way now and widening. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=228.12s)]
*  And let me just point one last point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  The biggest reason they're widening is that Joe Biden has a 44 percent job approval, and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump, when asked about his presidency, has a 55 percent job approval. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden has to close that gap, or it's going to be a tough race. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  You know, Ari, you look at the numbers, and, all right, here's America's population, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=249.8s)]
*  here's Israel's population. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  It would be the equivalent, based on population comparisons, extrapolated out, of 8,000 Americans [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=256.78s)]
*  taken hostage out of U.S. territory, 40,000 dead Americans in a single day. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=263.38s)]
*  And all Joe Biden has been doing is lecturing Israel on how they should fight this war, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=271.82s)]
*  how they need peace talks, how they need to ceasefire, now stabbing Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=278.44s)]
*  in the back, maybe using the Leahy law as a means of not even giving the IDF any military [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  aid or support at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=291.8s)]
*  But meanwhile, they just keep sending, you know, 100 billion-plus over to Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's not just Joe, it's Schumer, it's Pelosi. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=298.44000000000005s)]
*  And I would say it's all rooted in the fact that he wants every one of these votes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=306.12s)]
*  You know, I think you have to give Joe Biden credit, actually, Sean, credit for always, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=307.12s)]
*  consistently being wrong on foreign policy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=314.06s)]
*  I mean, go back to when he was a young senator and he opposed Ronald Reagan on missile defense, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=317.06s)]
*  the same missile defense that just stopped Iran. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  He was against the very successful and popular first Gulf War. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  He was for the unsuccessful second Gulf War. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=328.62s)]
*  He wanted to divide Iraq into three pieces. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=331.82000000000005s)]
*  That would have been a flop. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=334.74s)]
*  And now when it comes to Israel and Gaza, he's all over the map. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=336.22s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal said the two-state solution for Joe Biden is Michigan and Nevada. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=340.08s)]
*  Every decision he's making to put pressure on Israel, to put pressure on Netanyahu, is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=346.12s)]
*  all geared toward winning an election, not alienating our voters and the young people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  on campuses. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  But the problem he's got is he can't occupy a middle ground. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=356.7s)]
*  This is the flaw in his judgment. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=360.68s)]
*  You either have to, like George Bush said, you're with us here against us in this war [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=362.56s)]
*  now in Gaza, and he is abandoning Israel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  He's walked away from Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=368.4s)]
*  The only pressure is Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=369.76s)]
*  And he won't get the Arab vote. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=371.74s)]
*  They're going to stay home in substantial numbers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=373.34s)]
*  And he's going to lose—no, he won't lose, but he's going to have huge inroads made [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  by Republicans into the Jewish vote, another historical Democrat constituency. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=379.86s)]
*  Everything he does, he has a reverse Midas touch. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=385.14s)]
*  He messes up every foreign policy issue he's ever been involved in. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=388.42s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=391.46s)]
*  And if peace and prosperity, which historically have driven elections, if that remains the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  pattern, Joe Biden will lose in November. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=399.5s)]
*  If these numbers hold that we're seeing across the board, I don't see how we can come back. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=402.08s)]
*  But we have 189 days to go. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=407.6s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=410.44s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewPRo-Olus&t=411.44s)]
