# Will photos in Biden classified docs report expose a two-tiered justice system?
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8)
*  I do have big news out of Washington tonight where the attorney general Merrick Garland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=0.0s)]
*  says the special counsel investigating Joe Biden's alleged mishandling of classified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=6.16s)]
*  information. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=10.96s)]
*  Well, they have completed their work and the White House is now reviewing the report to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=11.96s)]
*  see if it wants to exert executive privilege over any part of that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=15.94s)]
*  And once that process is done, the report will be released to Congress and to we the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=20.96s)]
*  people, the public. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=25.52s)]
*  We are hearing that could happen by the end of the week. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, apparently that is something that Team Biden is very afraid of. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Axios reporting that Biden's aides believe the report will include embarrassing details [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=33.0s)]
*  and photos and be, quote, politically damaging. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=38.72s)]
*  Now, could the evidence be more damning than what we already have seen? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  You might remember this photo. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=47.28s)]
*  There you go, the beautiful Corvette in a Glock garage that never opens. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=48.44s)]
*  Anyway, showing those documents there, top secret documents in Joey's garage next to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=52.92s)]
*  his prized Corvette as a sitting president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=57.48s)]
*  Biden is unlikely to face any criminal charges. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=60.48s)]
*  As a matter of fact, he won't. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=62.8s)]
*  But if the photos in that report, what if they look a lot like the photos that we were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=64.28s)]
*  shown over and over again from the Mar-a-Lago raid? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=69.4s)]
*  Then I guess the only real damage done is going to be the exposure of Joe Biden's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=73.0s)]
*  weaponized Justice Department. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=77.8s)]
*  Huh? That wouldn't be good. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=79.72s)]
*  Here with reaction Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=81.24s)]
*  I think if they're so afraid of the photos, I think probably the main reason is the fact [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=84.84s)]
*  that it will expose a two tiered justice system, a weaponized and politicized DOJ of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=97.48s)]
*  They protected him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=98.48s)]
*  The photos look just like Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  What is that going to show people? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=101.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I would say credit is deserving of the whistleblowers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=102.88s)]
*  I mean, they're the ones who told us that the DOJ has been running a protection racket [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=110.04s)]
*  for Joe Biden for years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  Remember, investigators were banned from asking about Joe's involvement in his son's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=117.28s)]
*  influence peddling schemes, despite evidence of complicity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  So, Sean, did anybody really expect that Joe's document scandal would be treated any [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=127.92s)]
*  differently? I think the fix was in from the beginning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  Even Trump gets charged, Biden doesn't, even though, and this is important, Joe has no [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=137.16s)]
*  defense under the Federal Records Act. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=142.4s)]
*  Trump does because some of the records came from Biden's time as a senator, not president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=145.04s)]
*  And under the Records Act, a former president can have custody and control over such documents, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=151.56s)]
*  not a senator. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=157.94s)]
*  Indeed, that was the opinion of the Department of Justice for two long decades. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=159.2s)]
*  They argued in the famous Bill Clinton case that, you know, a former president can keep [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=164.72s)]
*  whatever he wants, including classified documents. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=171.16s)]
*  A federal judge agreed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=173.64s)]
*  Suddenly, Trump comes along and the DOJ throws that policy out the window. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=175.92s)]
*  They indict Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=181.84s)]
*  On top of it, they charge it with obstruction for doing exactly what Bill Clinton did. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=183.12s)]
*  Clinton resisted. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=189.72s)]
*  The proper legal remedy here was for Merrick Garland to file a civil action, not criminal, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=192.0s)]
*  which is under the act, and it's the governing authority. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=198.88s)]
*  That's how the Clinton case was handled. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=202.56s)]
*  Let a judge decide who gets what. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=204.64s)]
*  Instead, they criminalized it because it's Donald Trump, another example of how the DOJ [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=207.12s)]
*  has a two-tiered system of justice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=213.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Alex Berenson had a pretty good name for it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=215.8s)]
*  That's what we call the lawfare in a column that he wrote, and that is weaponizing and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=219.4s)]
*  criminalizing political differences. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  Just a different way to say it, but a pretty astute analysis. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=225.8s)]
*  All right, Greg Jarrett, thank you for that update. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=229.6s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-k7cRGj8&t=231.68s)]
