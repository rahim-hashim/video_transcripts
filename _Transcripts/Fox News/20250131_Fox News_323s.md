# Ted Cruz: Democrats tried to put on a circus
**Fox News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc)
*  Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us. Senator, I watched this and I watched him literally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=0.0s)]
*  school Dick Durbin, which I enjoyed every minute of, and Adam Schiff as well. But as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I was watching this and he spoke about the erosion of trust with the FBI, then Cash Patel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=13.44s)]
*  did something thatâ€”he made a commitment to never weaponize the FBI and to never politicize [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=19.96s)]
*  the FBI. And it became very apparent to me, and tell me if this is your conclusion as [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=27.28s)]
*  well, that the Democrats are afraid that that which they stood silent on and allowed to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=31.8s)]
*  happen under their watch, they don't want to have happen to them. And meanwhile, not [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=38.52s)]
*  one of those people on that committee, not one Democrat, ever spoke out about how the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=44.88s)]
*  unequal use of our justice system against Donald Trump or the valuation of our logo [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=51.0s)]
*  or FISA warrants or not raiding Hillary and Biden's home, but raiding Mar-a-Lago and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=56.36s)]
*  on and on and on. So I think they're afraid. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=61.72s)]
*  Look, John, I think you're absolutely right. Let's first of all take an assessment of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=67.52s)]
*  what happened today in the hearings. And I got to say, watching the Democrats' ridiculous [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=72.04s)]
*  behavior in the hearings, it reminded me of a line from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=76.84s)]
*  a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury and signifying nothing. I think the Democrats, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=82.72s)]
*  they tried to put on a circus. They screamed. They yelled. They stomped their little feets. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=89.48s)]
*  They beat the table. But at the end of the day, what is really striking is none of them [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=93.52s)]
*  made a serious argument that Cash Patel is not qualified. He spent nearly two decades [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=99.08s)]
*  working in law enforcement. He's been a federal public defender. He's been a federal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=104.48s)]
*  prosecutor. He's worked in the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=107.88s)]
*  He's been a senior national security staffer on Capitol Hill. He's worked in the National [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=112.0s)]
*  Security apparatus in the White House. And he's been the chief of staff at the Department [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=117.36s)]
*  of Defense. I mean, his experience is extensive. What they are afraid of is that Cash Patel [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=122.96s)]
*  will do exactly what Donald Trump promised. They are afraid. You know, it's striking. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  If you look at what President Trump campaigned on across the country, one of the core promises [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=136.72s)]
*  Donald Trump made to this nation is that he would end the politicization and the weaponization [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=142.16s)]
*  of the Department of Justice and the FBI. He would bring integrity back to DOJ and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=147.48s)]
*  FBI. And the Democrats are terrified. That's exactly what Cash Patel will do. Not weaponize [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=152.64s)]
*  it against Democrats, but bring the FBI back to its core mission of stopping bad guys and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=159.8s)]
*  enforcing the law regardless of party. And they're freaking out. But here's the good [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=166.68s)]
*  news, Sean. They didn't score a single blow today. Cash Patel will be confirmed as the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  next director of the FBI. And maybe, maybe one of the most dramatic moments is they seemed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=177.84s)]
*  obsessed with January 6th, January 6th. And, and then he turned it on them. And he said [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=184.32s)]
*  it was Dick Durbin. What about the two people that at point blank range murdered two FBI [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=192.2s)]
*  agents and Joe Biden pardoned? Didn't hear a peep out of him about that from that point. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, look, the pattern of politicization and weaponization, you saw it in Joe Biden's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=204.0s)]
*  pardons, which were absolutely shameful and disgraceful, pardoning violent criminal after [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=211.76s)]
*  violent criminal. You saw it in terms of the FBI and DOJ going after pro-life protesters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  showing up at their home with withdrawn machine guns. You saw it in terms of repeatedly going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=221.72s)]
*  after the president of the United States, Donald Trump. In more than 200 years, we'd [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=228.12s)]
*  never indicted a president even once. And yet Democrat prosecutors did so four different [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  times. That weaponization, every Democrat in the Senate remained silent. They were perfectly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  fine with and Donald Trump campaigned to the American people said, we're going to end [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=243.64s)]
*  this garbage. And Cash Patel has been nominated to do that. And by the way, one of the consequences [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=247.76s)]
*  of weaponization, if you're chasing every little old lady who on January 6th was waving [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  an American flag and singing God bless America, and yet Joe Biden's Justice Department was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=259.2s)]
*  trying to throw her in jail, you know what you're not doing? You're not catching bank [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=264.12s)]
*  robbers or serial killers or terrorists. And four years of open borders, I believe Cash [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=267.64s)]
*  Patel is going to go after the terrorists, go after the criminals, put them in jail and keep [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=272.72s)]
*  America safe. And the Democrats are unhappy because that's what the American people want. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=277.32s)]
*  The director of the FBI. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=281.72s)]
*  Let's give them one last hint. Even though Joe Biden pardoned his family members, Joe [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=282.64s)]
*  Biden's did leverage a billion taxpayer dollars to get a prosecutor in Ukraine fired for his [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=287.56s)]
*  son who had no experience in Ukraine or energy, oil, gas or coal. At a time he was addicted [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=294.36s)]
*  to drugs and got paid millions. And according to his own laptop says he gave a lot of that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=300.88s)]
*  money to Joe. That would be called the legitimate investigation in my mind. Anyway, Senator, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  appreciate you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks945Ckipgc&t=310.56s)]
