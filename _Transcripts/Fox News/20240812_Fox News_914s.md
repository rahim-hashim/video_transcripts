# Sean Hannity: Kamala and her campaign are 'flat-out' lying
**Fox News:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU)
*  All right, first tonight, the honeymoon. Well, guess what? And the sugar high from the coronation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=0.0s)]
*  of Kamala Harris is beginning to wear thin. It'll take a little while. Her election year conversion [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=4.64s)]
*  and flipping and flopping and flailing on virtually everything is beyond the pal. It's like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=10.32s)]
*  every day there's another flip flop plal. And by the way, her inability, unwillingness to speak [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=14.8s)]
*  off script, it should be disconcerting to every American. At least Joe Biden, at least he kind of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  had an excuse. He couldn't talk. Her track record is so historically bad and her weird, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=26.48s)]
*  radical far left running mate is now plagued by a huge scandal. And he's as extreme as she is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=32.88s)]
*  We're going to get into all the detail, but we do begin with a shocking admission today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=39.52s)]
*  We discovered yet another insane position of the Democratic presidential nominee. Here's Kamala [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=43.84s)]
*  in 2019 telling a supporter that if elected, she's going to release all criminal illegal aliens, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=49.6s)]
*  although she doesn't like that word. She wants you to have the courage to stop using it. We [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=56.4s)]
*  won't have her courage, which is stupidity from detention centers, giving them free range across [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=60.56s)]
*  the United States. Listen to this. I want to know when you become president, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=66.72s)]
*  would you be committing to close the immigration detention centers? Absolutely. On day one, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=73.28s)]
*  on day one. And thank you for your work. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=81.84s)]
*  Now that's America's border czar calling for criminals in this country illegally to be released [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  right into a neighborhood near you. I'll tell you about some crimes later in the program that were [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  committed by Harris Biden, unvetted illegal immigrants. Late last week, she said she wants [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  a pathway that citizenship for illegals that's called amnesty and in the country. And she wants [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=104.96s)]
*  to, as we all know, decriminalize illegal immigration and sanctuary states and give illegal aliens, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=112.24s)]
*  free housing, healthcare education, and her crazy weird running mate agrees with all the above [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  and also wants to give legal driver's licenses in his state. But the dangerous far left policies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  don't end here. It's only the beginning. Kamala is beholden to a radical, extreme, dangerous base. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=132.4s)]
*  She always has been, she always will be if she's elected. These extreme policies in the Biden-Harris [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  administration, they will now seem moderate by comparison. For example, here are just a few [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  things. By the way, we keep updating her extremism every day. Here's a few things that Kamala pledged [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=149.68s)]
*  to do if she's ever president. Take a look. If they fail to act as president of the United States, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=154.88s)]
*  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. You support giving [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=162.08s)]
*  universal healthcare and Medicare for all to people who are in this country illegally? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=172.24s)]
*  human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period. Will you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=179.44000000000003s)]
*  commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=187.36s)]
*  to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? There's no question I'm in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=193.44000000000003s)]
*  favor of banning fracking. We have to reimagine public safety in America. She's promoting policies [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=197.36s)]
*  like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=204.96s)]
*  within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=208.8s)]
*  possibly, and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party? No. You know, I think [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  that she is challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=220.0s)]
*  corporate tax rate. We also have to increase taxes for the top 1 percent, and that part of that is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=226.8s)]
*  going to be about repealing that tax bill they just passed. And also looking at estate taxes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=233.68s)]
*  are going to have to go up. Would you support changing the dietary guidelines? Yes. You know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=238.56s)]
*  the food pyramid. Yes. But people are like, reduce red meat specifically. Yes, I would. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=242.88s)]
*  Plastic straws are a big thing right now. Yeah. Do you ban plastic straws? I think we should. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=247.04s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=252.48s)]
*  way that it is being administered and the work it is doing, and we need to probably think about [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=257.92s)]
*  starting from scratch. Millions of specifically assault weapons that are already in circulation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=261.76s)]
*  What do you do about those? Well, there are approximately five million to your point, Craig. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=272.0s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? Yes. And I've again worked on that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  Mandatory buyback. Why do I think of the word confiscation? That was not long ago at all. But [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=282.72s)]
*  now with Kamala at the top of the ticket and election year conversion, like this country has [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=288.48s)]
*  never seen before, almost every one of Kamala's deeply held beliefs are so insane, she and her [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=292.8s)]
*  campaign now know that if she runs on her true beliefs or true principles, she will lose and lose [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=299.6s)]
*  badly. So she and her campaign have decided to flip, flop and just flat out lie to all of you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=306.24s)]
*  Why? Because they'll do and say anything to win. Watch. Will you commit to implementing a federal [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=313.6s)]
*  ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  have banned this devastating practice? There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=325.44s)]
*  Things like fracking, for instance, she has changed her position on, which is good. And she [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=329.2s)]
*  has a legitimate point of view to say that. We have to reimagine public safety in America. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  It no longer supports any sentiment around defunding the police. Millions of specifically [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=340.08s)]
*  assault weapons that are already in circulation. What do you do about those? Well, there are [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=347.28s)]
*  approximately five million to your point, Craig. We have to have a buyback program, and I support [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=351.36s)]
*  a mandatory buyback program. She supports an assault weapons ban still, but she does not support [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=355.6s)]
*  anymore a requirement to sell them back to the federal government. And it gets even more insane. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=361.04s)]
*  Kamala is now even plagiarizing Donald Trump. She has a bold plan to end taxes on tips, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=367.6s)]
*  but there's a catch. I'll tell you in about in a second. Take a look. And it is my promise to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=373.68s)]
*  everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  Including to raise the minimum wage [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=385.2s)]
*  and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=390.8s)]
*  Two problems with Kamala's election year conversion and lie. First, she literally stole the idea from [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=398.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. And here is Donald Trump two months ago. And he said it many times since [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=404.24s)]
*  before Kamala was even running for president. Take a look. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=409.28s)]
*  This is the first time I've said this. And for those hotel workers and people that get tips, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=413.12s)]
*  you're going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=418.4s)]
*  taxes on tips. People making tips. I've announced that as part of those tax cuts, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=424.4s)]
*  I will eliminate all taxes on tips. A very simple statement. No taxes or tips. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=430.56s)]
*  We will pass massive tax cuts for workers. And that includes no tax on tips. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=437.36s)]
*  No tax on tips. And that'll be done immediately. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=444.56s)]
*  Now, here's the second and bigger problem for Kamala's promise to eliminate taxes on tips. You [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  see, while President Trump genuinely wants to end these taxes and cut taxes when he did cut them [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=454.32s)]
*  when he was president, Kamala is just lying as a ploy to win votes. She doesn't actually want to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  eliminate taxes on tips. Now, how do we know that? Because in 2022, it was her, Vice President [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=465.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris, delivering, you know, the tie vote in the U.S. Senate to pass the so-called [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=472.88s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. Now, this was a massive green new energy spending bill that actually made [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=479.36s)]
*  inflation worse. And it was paid for in part with taxes on tips. Here is yours truly last year [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=485.68s)]
*  warning you about Kamala's tax crackdown. Take a look. Biden seems intent on taking your earnings [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=492.96s)]
*  hostage. Now, the IRS, they just announced this week that they want to start tracking all of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=500.64s)]
*  tips that workers earn so that they can be taxed for it. So, so much for Biden's sacred promise [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Remember, this is all part of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=512.88s)]
*  Biden's so-called Inflation Reduction Act. Now, if you work in the service industry, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=518.64s)]
*  I spent like 10 years of my life doing that. You were recently audited and you were recently [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=524.08s)]
*  audited by the IRS. You can thank Kamala Harris. If you work in the service industry and you have [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=528.24s)]
*  yet to face your audit, buckle up because the Biden-Harris administration, they'll be coming [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=533.84s)]
*  after you in order to pay for their $93 trillion green new deal dreams. Will she actually ever be [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=538.72s)]
*  asked about this issue? Will she answer any tough questions at all? Take a look at this Fox News [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=545.04s)]
*  headline. Quote, Kamala Harris has not held a press conference since emerging as the presumptive [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=550.48s)]
*  Democratic nominee. And this from the Washington Post for crying out loud. Quote, questions we'd [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=556.48s)]
*  love to ask Kamala Harris. Why has she changed so many positions since 2020? And look at this, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=561.92s)]
*  questions posed by the Atlantic. Why Kamala Harris's politics is so hard to pin down? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=568.24s)]
*  Um, I'll answer this one. If she tells the truth, she's going to lose on a landslide. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=574.0s)]
*  She can't tell the truth. I love she says, well, on day one, I'm going to deal with inflation [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=578.8800000000001s)]
*  and we're going to fix the border. That's my top priority of elected president. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  She acts like she's an outsider. She's been the vice president for four years, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  lying about inflation being transitory and the border being closed and secure. But she'd never [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  been there, but she'd never been to Europe either. There's not even a policy section on her [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=598.72s)]
*  website. She can't defend the radical statements in her own words. Now we just get whispers from [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  anonymous campaign sources, vague platitudes during the same speech over and over again, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=609.52s)]
*  delivered of course from a teleprompter. She won't even join her fan club on fake news CNN. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. You've now asked me three questions about comments that I made three years ago. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=619.6s)]
*  I wonder what Kamala Harris thinks about the fact that she supported policies that open the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=624.72s)]
*  American Southern border. I wonder what Kamala Harris thinks about the fact that she lied to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=629.2s)]
*  the American people about Joe Biden's middle facility for the office. You are interviewing [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=633.04s)]
*  me, Dana, because I respect the American people enough to sit down for an interview. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=638.64s)]
*  I appreciate that. Kamala Harris has been the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=642.32s)]
*  nominee for three weeks. She hasn't sat down for a real interview. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=643.84s)]
*  Believe me, we are asking. You're not going to get a disagreement there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=646.88s)]
*  But the point is, Dana, you've got me for 15 minutes or however long you have me. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=649.76s)]
*  We should be talking about public policies that matter. How are we going to lower inflation? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=653.36s)]
*  How are we going to reduce the cost of food and housing? How are we going to close down [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=657.76s)]
*  that southern border? We've talked so little about that. We've talked a lot more about a sarcastic [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=661.04s)]
*  remark I made three years ago. I think we should talk about the issues that most Americans care [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=665.52s)]
*  about. Checkmate JD. It's actually pretty simple. If you want to predict how Kamala will really [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  govern, look at what she does. Listen to what she said before she was actually running for [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=675.28s)]
*  president here in the nomination. She was running hardcore, radical left, left of Bernie Sanders. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=679.92s)]
*  She didn't even pick a moderate running mate to balance out the ticket. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=685.76s)]
*  Walls is about as far left as it gets. In 2020, as governor, he stood by and did nothing while [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=689.28s)]
*  cities in his state were being burned to the ground for five whole days. But his family opened up the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=695.28s)]
*  windows of their house. They wanted to bask in and take in the smell of the riots. Apparently, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=701.5999999999999s)]
*  they loved the smell of burning rubber as their cities were burning and he did nothing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=706.88s)]
*  Make no mistake, Walls is extreme, radical and dangerous, just like her. Here's him in his own [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=713.12s)]
*  words. So instead of speculating, I want to ask you directly, Governor Walls, are you a progressive [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=719.92s)]
*  or are you a centrist? How about progressive? Don't ever shy away from our progressive values. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=725.6s)]
*  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness. Should Minnesota be a sanctuary [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=731.2s)]
*  state? If the definition of that is that the federal government enforces immigration law [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=735.44s)]
*  and local law enforcement enforces local law, then yes. Should cities be allowed to be sanctuary [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=740.8800000000001s)]
*  cities? Yes, local control. Protecting and supporting access to gender-affirming health care [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  is essential to being a welcoming and supportive state to the community. He talks about this wall. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=752.0s)]
*  I always say, let me know how high it is. If it's 25 feet, then I'll invest in the 30-foot [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  ladder factory. Minneapolis-St. Paul, the state of Minnesota, nationally and as we've seen over [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=762.08s)]
*  the last 24 hours, internationally. A society that does not put equity and inclusion at the center of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=766.64s)]
*  it is certainly going to eventually come to the places where we're at. There is so much potential [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=772.88s)]
*  here. Why would Minnesota not seize the moment and become the best state in the nation on equity? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=778.96s)]
*  Why would you not add that to your accomplishments? I think the mayor said I request a national guard. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  This is great. We're going to have massively trained troops. No, you're going to have 19-year-olds who [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  are cooks in some cases. Now, while Walls trashes young service members in the National Guard, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=794.16s)]
*  it is important to look at his service in the Guard. According to Walls, he bravely fought [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=800.72s)]
*  overseas with weapons of war that you shouldn't have and seemingly returned home with PTSD. Watch. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=805.6s)]
*  We can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=813.84s)]
*  reciprocal carry among states and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=817.44s)]
*  war is the only place where those weapons were. Both of you with your keen understanding of how [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  this works, especially from National Guard families, I can tell you this. Having been one [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=826.96s)]
*  of those that came back, we were in support of OEF, but being sitting in there with OEF, OIF [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=831.5200000000001s)]
*  veterans, when we came back, they showed us the horse whisper and told us to be nice when we went [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  home and that was the extent of it. That was in 2004. Yeah, turns out Walls was never deployed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=840.08s)]
*  to a combat zone. He served in Italy and a few other countries, not inside a combat zone. When [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=847.36s)]
*  he was deployed, he decided to hang it up and leave his battalion behind, even though he had [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=853.04s)]
*  two years left to service. As for his rank, Walls inflated that as well. In his biography and Twitter [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=859.12s)]
*  page, he referred to himself as a retired command sergeant major, which is inaccurate, a lie. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=865.6s)]
*  According to allegations, Walls left the National Guard soon after learning his platoon would be [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=871.44s)]
*  deployed to Iraq. So the former leader of Walls' battalion had this to say, quote, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=875.92s)]
*  he did not earn the rank or successfully complete any assignments as an E-9, a sergeant major. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  It is an affront to the non-commissioned officer corps that he continues to glom onto this title. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=887.12s)]
*  I can sit in the cockpit of an airplane, doesn't make me a pilot. Tonight, the Harris-Walls ticket [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2afuKpmDU&t=893.52s)]
