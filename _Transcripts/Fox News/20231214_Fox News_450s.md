# Mark Levin: The Supreme Court shouldn't have taken this
**Fox News:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU)
*  And today, a major legal victory for former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, a federal judge agreed to pause the proceedings in his January 6 case—that's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=6.04s)]
*  the D.C. case—until the courts render a decision on Trump's claim that he is immune [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=11.48s)]
*  from prosecution because he was president at the time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=16.56s)]
*  Joining us now, he is the host of Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=19.72s)]
*  We call him the Great One, Mark Levin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=22.7s)]
*  Great One, legally? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=25.04s)]
*  Let's analyze. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=26.04s)]
*  Well, first, Sean, the No Labels Party, do they understand that the No Labels Party is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=27.08s)]
*  a label? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=33.24s)]
*  And secondly, he's going to take a two-month tour of the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Guy's been a governor and senator. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=38.84s)]
*  He's going to take a tour of what? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=40.08s)]
*  We used to call that a junket. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=41.8s)]
*  And then he wants the people to rally to the No Labels Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=43.84s)]
*  What do you stand for? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=46.44s)]
*  Well, can't we all get along? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=47.44s)]
*  So that's going to fail. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=48.9s)]
*  But anyway, let me go on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=50.04s)]
*  First, I want to talk about impeachment here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=52.96s)]
*  And I want to say to the three guests you add on, three great chairmen, I think you [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=56.4s)]
*  really need to focus in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=60.92s)]
*  I have no opposition to focusing on the financial fraud and the selling of public office by [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=62.36s)]
*  the Biden family. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=67.24s)]
*  But it gets very complicated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=69.28s)]
*  So that should be Article 3 of the eventual list of impeachable offenses, because I think [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=70.64s)]
*  this president's impeachable. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=75.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=77.12s)]
*  Because of what should be Article 1. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=78.12s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Article 2, Section 3 of the United States Constitution compels a president that he shall [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=81.86s)]
*  take care that the laws be faithfully executed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=87.38s)]
*  Laws be faithfully executed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=91.06s)]
*  The president of the United States has his own oath. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=92.42s)]
*  And it's not until after he takes an oath, he puts his hand on the Bible and the right [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=96.58s)]
*  hand in the air, and he takes that oath, that he can become president of the United States [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=99.64s)]
*  during his inauguration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=103.78s)]
*  I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=104.78s)]
*  Will the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=109.02s)]
*  States? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=112.86s)]
*  So, the Constitution says you may not like certain laws, Joe Biden, but you're going [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=113.86s)]
*  to enforce them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=118.42s)]
*  Otherwise, you're destroying separation of powers and the power of the legislature. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=119.42s)]
*  You can't just blow off the legislature with executive orders or directives or something [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  of that sort. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=128.82s)]
*  Now, why is that important? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=129.82s)]
*  Well, because that's exactly what he's done. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=131.26s)]
*  We don't need hearings. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  We don't need depositions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=136.14s)]
*  We don't need testimony. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=137.66s)]
*  We don't need text messages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  We don't need anything. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=141.18s)]
*  Joe Biden has violated every single federal immigration law that's on the books. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=143.22s)]
*  He's doing it every day. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=150.0s)]
*  He's doing it intentionally. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=151.46s)]
*  The border's wide open. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=152.96s)]
*  The American people are less safe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=154.48s)]
*  Terrorists are trying to get in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=156.34s)]
*  Criminals are getting in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=157.82s)]
*  Toxic drugs are getting in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=159.38s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=161.18s)]
*  People are being raped. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=162.64s)]
*  They're being sold into sex slavery. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=163.64s)]
*  Now, why is all that important? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=165.61999999999998s)]
*  It's important because it's an impeachable offense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=167.82s)]
*  I just read you the two sections of the Constitution where he's required to uphold the law. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=170.88s)]
*  He is defying and undermining the law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, let's look at impeachment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=177.98s)]
*  The framers of the Constitution. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  Impeachment, what did they look at? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=182.1s)]
*  They looked at, among other things, 17th and 18th century British common law. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=184.1s)]
*  And you look at the impeachment clause, what is a high crime? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  So high crime means the president goes out and kills a whole bunch of people? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=195.7s)]
*  Well, what does it mean? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=196.7s)]
*  High, in the legal common vocabulary, the 17th and 18th centuries of high crimes, this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=197.7s)]
*  is what the framers looked at, is the activity by or against those who have special duties [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=203.1s)]
*  acquired by taking an oath of office that is not shared with ordinary persons. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=209.9s)]
*  He has committed a high crime, multiple high crimes, by refusing to enforce our immigration [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=215.22s)]
*  laws. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=221.42s)]
*  Now, is that easier to understand? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=222.42s)]
*  Is that more important to the average American? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=224.98s)]
*  Can the average American get behind an impeachment that makes it clear on Article 1 that this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=227.38s)]
*  man has violated at least two clauses of the Constitution? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  He will not uphold the law. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  He will not secure the border. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=237.26s)]
*  That is a high crime. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=239.22s)]
*  That is an impeachable offense. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  You see how simple that is? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  We don't need subpoenas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=244.88s)]
*  We don't need depositions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  All we need is the video from the TV cameras. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=249.1s)]
*  The second article should be the student loans issue. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  Separation of powers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=255.9s)]
*  The president doesn't have the power to seize the power of the purse from the House of Representatives. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=256.9s)]
*  That's another separation of powers issue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=261.02s)]
*  The Supreme Court already told him, Joe, you don't have the power to do that with those [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=263.14s)]
*  student loans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=268.02s)]
*  Joe says, boop, and he tries to find a way around it, and he has spent half a trillion [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=269.02s)]
*  dollars in funds by not enforcing student loan payments in violation of the federal [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=275.38s)]
*  Constitution, separation of powers that power the purse, and violating an order of the Supreme [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=283.1s)]
*  Court. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=288.94s)]
*  How simple is that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=289.94s)]
*  How many hearings do we need on that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=290.94s)]
*  And then we can have your Article 3 and the Article 3 of the other chairmen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=291.94s)]
*  Well, this money went here, and Ernie did this, and Frank did that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=295.7s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=299.18s)]
*  Crime is a crime. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=301.02s)]
*  But Mr. and Mrs. America cannot follow all this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=302.64s)]
*  Mr. and Mrs. America can follow what I call my Article 1. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=306.36s)]
*  They can follow Article 2. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=310.0s)]
*  They can see how it directly affects them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=311.8s)]
*  That doesn't give a pass to what should be Article 3. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=314.4s)]
*  And this resolution that they pass for an inquiry allows for them to take all these [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=317.52s)]
*  things on. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=321.64s)]
*  So, as a special pleader for the Constitution to make this simple, to get the people around [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=322.64s)]
*  the world to follow the law. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=330.08s)]
*  And I'm not against it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=331.08s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=332.08s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=333.08s)]

*  An ex-president with acts he took, whether you like them or not, when he was president, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=385.08s)]
*  why? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=390.08s)]
*  Because he has immunity. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=391.08s)]
*  Well, it doesn't follow him, Judge Trumpkin says. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=392.08s)]
*  He's not a king. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  That has nothing to do with it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=395.76s)]
*  If the court takes this up and rules for the prosecution, that means that lawyers can sue [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=397.59999999999997s)]

*  And any ex-president, the same thing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=407.96s)]
*  It would be a disaster. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  The court shouldn't take it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  They should let it follow the process. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=412.64s)]
*  And they should kill what Jack Smith's trying to do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=414.52s)]

*  But why did the court take it? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=427.88s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=428.88s)]
*  It should have gone to the lower courts first. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=429.88s)]
*  It shouldn't have taken it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=430.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=431.88s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=432.88s)]
*  It shouldn't have, and I'm worried about it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=433.88s)]
*  I am too. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=434.88s)]
*  Anyway, Mark Levin, the great one, thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdk-CoF-CxU&t=435.88s)]
