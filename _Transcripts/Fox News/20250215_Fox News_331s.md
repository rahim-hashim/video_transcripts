# Sen. Blackburn praises Trump for ‘promises made, promises kept’
**Fox News:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs)
*  Joining us now with reaction Tennessee Senator Marcia Blackburn. Senator, thanks for joining us on this Valentine's evening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it's amazing to me that you have a president, if he just does what he says he's going to do, people are like shocked and surprised. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=9.0s)]
*  And he's having huge success. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=18.0s)]
*  Indeed he is. It is promises made, promises kept. And as you're saying, Doge is saving the American people about a billion dollars a day. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=22.0s)]
*  They want to move that up to about three billion dollars a day. And indeed, with the audits that they are carrying out, the work that they are doing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=33.0s)]
*  You know, Jason, the great thing about this, I hear from Tennesseans every single day, whether they're Democrat, Republican, independent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=43.0s)]
*  They have all turned into whistleblowers looking for ways to save money for the hard earned taxpayer, hard working taxpayer, because it was hard to earn those dollars. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=51.0s)]
*  They don't want it to be wasted. They are going through doing their income tax right now, and they want to make certain that the federal government starts to pinch a few pennies and that they give the taxpayer a break. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=64.0s)]
*  People are tired of inflation. Donald Trump said he was going to get that inflation down. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=78.0s)]
*  That requires the federal government to spend less. And President Donald Trump is keeping that promise. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=84.0s)]
*  And Doge is a big part of this focus on the economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=92.0s)]
*  Senator, you've always worked closely with President Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=99.0s)]
*  How is Trump 47 different than Trump 45? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=102.0s)]
*  I mean, he has come out of the gates so strong, so fast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=107.0s)]
*  He has the experience now that he didn't have before. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=112.0s)]
*  But how do you see the differences in this administration as opposed to when he took office back in after 2016 election? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=114.0s)]
*  You know, Jason, I think one of the big things is the American people gave him such a strong mandate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=123.0s)]
*  And they knew what life was like under Biden, which was worse than what it had been under Obama. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=129.0s)]
*  And they said, we don't want four more years of this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=137.0s)]
*  And the American people have really just joined arms and locked arms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=141.0s)]
*  They're working with us. And like I said, it doesn't matter what their political affiliation is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=149.0s)]
*  They are saying, we can do this. We can get this country back on track. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=157.0s)]
*  And Tennesseans are saying, let's do this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=163.0s)]
*  Let's make certain that we're spending less, that we're doing more with less. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=167.0s)]
*  Let's make certain that we get inside every one of these departments and pull out the waste, stop the fraud, stop the abuse. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=172.0s)]
*  Let's make certain that we're going to be smart and be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=182.0s)]
*  That is what they want. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=189.0s)]
*  They like what President Trump is doing on the global stage and the way hostages are coming home. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=191.0s)]
*  They like the fact that he has pushed forward really well-qualified people who know what they're doing to be a part of his cabinet and that we are confirming these. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=198.0s)]
*  We've done 16 so far. And if we have to stay there every weekend, work every weekend, that is what we're going to do because the American people said, let's get this job done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=211.0s)]
*  You're an influential member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=225.0s)]
*  Passed out a committee, Cash Patel is the FBI director. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=229.0s)]
*  But the big question going into next week is, can the full Senate, will the Republicans actually rally around Cash Patel and install him as the, and confirm him as the next FBI director? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=233.0s)]
*  What is your read on where we're at and will that happen? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=246.0s)]
*  It is going to happen. Cash Patel is going to be confirmed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=249.0s)]
*  He is going to be an outstanding director of the FBI. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=255.0s)]
*  He is going to end two tiers of justice, two tiers of treatment that we have seen from the FBI. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=260.0s)]
*  He's going to fight this weaponization. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=268.0s)]
*  And Jason, the Democrats are very fearful of Cash Patel because they know he knows exactly what happened with Russia collusion. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=270.0s)]
*  And they know that he is going to clean house over at the FBI. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is why he's an exceptional choice. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=289.0s)]
*  And I was proud of Chairman Grassley, yourself and others getting behind and getting to Cash Patel safely out of committee and onto the floor. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=291.0s)]
*  We'll see if those other somewhat weak-kneed Republicans can actually stand the heat in the kitchen and actually do the right thing and give Donald Trump the right FBI director to work there with Attorney General Pam Bonney. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=300.0s)]
*  That's good news. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=314.0s)]
*  Senator Blackburn, again, happy Valentine's. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=315.0s)]
*  Thanks again for joining us this evening on Hannity. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdpFDeVxPs&t=318.0s)]
