# Sean Hannity on media’s deportation hysteria: ‘This is all they know’
**Fox News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we do have a big announcement at the end of the show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=10.36s)]
*  I will be back in Washington, D.C., tomorrow. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=12.02s)]
*  All right, another busy day, nonstop action from the Trump administration and the media [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=14.08s)]
*  mob spinning in circles, predictably. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  This as some of the worst people in the D.C. swamp are trying to derail Tulsi Gabbard's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=22.48s)]
*  nomination as Donald Trump's director of national intelligence. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=27.68s)]
*  Coming up, Meghan McCain will join us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=31.52s)]
*  She wants to defend Tulsi Gabbard from what has been a pretty disgraceful smear campaign. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=33.64s)]
*  Let me just warn you, buckle up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=39.2s)]
*  All week, it's going to be Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Cash Patel, and it will be one [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=41.36s)]
*  attempt after another to bork Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, all of these nominees [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=47.36s)]
*  of President Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=53.88s)]
*  So don't be surprised. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=54.92s)]
*  Also tonight, my interview with Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=56.34s)]
*  I asked if he would be open to a negotiated settlement that takes NATO off the table and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=60.02s)]
*  some compromise on territorial issues. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=65.7s)]
*  We'll tell you about his answer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=68.30000000000001s)]
*  I also asked him a question about whether or not Ukraine will pay the U.S. back the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=69.86s)]
*  couple of hundred billion dollars that the U.S. has given them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=75.06s)]
*  But first, today, after four long years, competency was restored to the White House press briefing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=78.86s)]
*  room. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=84.34s)]
*  New White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, stood behind the podium for her very [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=85.34s)]
*  first official briefing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=89.58s)]
*  She wasted no time taking down members of the state-run legacy media mob. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=91.42s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has always been the hardest working man in politics. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=97.94s)]
*  I think that's been proven over the past week. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=100.12s)]
*  This president has again signed more than 300 executive orders. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=102.86s)]
*  He's taken historic action. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  I gaggle the board, Air Force One, to mark the first 100 days of this administration, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=108.62s)]
*  4 p.m. last Friday, our first 100 hours, rather. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=113.9s)]
*  And this president did more in the first 100 hours than the previous president did in the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=116.9s)]
*  first 100 days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=120.5s)]
*  The past four years, we've seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=121.5s)]
*  It's a big reason we've had an inflation crisis in this country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=125.9s)]
*  And it's incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  accounted for honestly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=132.86s)]
*  This administration is taking into consideration how hard the American people are working. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=134.18s)]
*  And their tax dollars actually matter to this administration. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=140.38s)]
*  The OJNOMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=143.82s)]
*  out the door to fund condoms in Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=147.9s)]
*  That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=150.98s)]
*  I would like to point out to each and every one of you that in 2024, when Joe Biden was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=153.66s)]
*  in the Oval Office or upstairs in the residence sleeping, I'm not so sure, egg prices increased [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=158.42s)]
*  65 percent in this country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  I will say it's very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=167.18s)]
*  is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=171.26s)]
*  And that's exactly what this administration is doing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=175.94s)]
*  It's correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=178.66s)]
*  have been told to your faces in this very briefing room. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=183.14s)]
*  I will not do that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=186.1s)]
*  But since you brought up truth seek, I would like to point out while I vow to provide the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=187.46s)]
*  truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=192.06s)]
*  standard. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=196.5s)]
*  By the way, she absolutely crushed it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=197.5s)]
*  I'm still shocked and awe for the mainstream media mob. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=200.54s)]
*  What a difference, by the way, a week makes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=202.82s)]
*  Clearly, today, a star was born in that room. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=205.22s)]
*  The previous administration, they used the press briefing room to peddle lies and misinformation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=208.42s)]
*  and propaganda from a giant binder full of, you know, pre-written talking points. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=213.18s)]
*  And of course, we're still waiting on Jen Psaki to circle back, especially on the egregious [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=218.1s)]
*  that the border is secure and closed as millions and millions of unvetted Harris, Biden, illegal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=225.1s)]
*  immigrants poured across our borders right before our eyes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=232.1s)]
*  She flat out lied to us for years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=236.1s)]
*  Biden, Kamala, failed DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=239.42s)]
*  They pushed this lie on you, the American people, while simultaneously allowing the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  greatest national security disaster in our nation's history to unfold. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=248.5s)]
*  Thankfully, there is a new sheriff in town, and that is former governor, DHS secretary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=253.62s)]
*  Kristi Noem. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=259.86s)]
*  She'll join us in a moment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=260.86s)]
*  She is not messing around. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=262.3s)]
*  And on just her second day on the job, she joined an illegal immigration raid in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=264.54s)]
*  Bronx and in New York City, writing on X, We are doing what President Trump promised [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=269.94s)]
*  the American people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=274.7s)]
*  We are making our streets safe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=276.14s)]
*  That is what real leadership looks like. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=278.42s)]
*  Now, throughout the morning, immigration officials, they partnered with federal law enforcement [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=280.62s)]
*  agencies to carry out all of these raids, arresting a number of criminal illegal aliens [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=284.66s)]
*  in our country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=290.5s)]
*  As the operation continued, Secretary Noem posted several updates touting the capture [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=292.04s)]
*  of what she described as dirtbags among the numerous criminal illegal aliens arrested [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=297.76s)]
*  was one of the alleged ringleaders of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=303.3s)]
*  was wanted on charges of kidnapping, burglary, menacing as part of the violent takeover of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=310.1s)]
*  that apartment building in Colorado. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=316.34s)]
*  That's where a group of heavily armed men could be seen on video forcing their way into [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=318.14s)]
*  an apartment. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  The raids in New York City this morning are just the latest in the administration's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=325.02s)]
*  nationwide crackdown in big cities and small towns all across the country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security put out a statement announcing 7,000 [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=333.94s)]
*  300 illegal aliens were arrested in Donald Trump's first week alone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=339.98s)]
*  As of 11 a.m., ICE said there had already been nearly 1,000 arrests made just this morning. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=345.74s)]
*  President Trump reportedly wants at least 1,800 arrests every single day. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  With millions and millions here, that's a doable number. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=359.74s)]
*  According to the press secretary, Caroline Levitt, who we just played, Donald Trump is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  deadly serious about cleaning up the illegal immigration disaster and the national security [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=366.98s)]
*  crisis that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris left behind. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=372.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  President Trump has sent a loud and clear message to the entire world. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  America will no longer tolerate illegal immigration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=382.66s)]
*  So, to foreign nationals who are thinking about trying to illegally enter the United [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  States, think again. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=390.66s)]
*  Under this president, you will be detained and you will be deported. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=393.1s)]
*  Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals that President Trump's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  administration is removing from our communities. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=405.66s)]
*  you just tell us the numbers? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=410.82000000000005s)]
*  How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  All of them, because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore they are [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  criminals as far as this administration goes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=419.02000000000004s)]
*  Checkmate, naturally. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=422.02s)]
*  Not everybody's celebrating the Trump administration and their efforts to make our country safer. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=423.9s)]
*  You know, well, as per usual, reverting to form several members of the left-wing, state-run [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=429.46s)]
*  legacy media mob. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=435.7s)]
*  They are in a meltdown mode. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=437.34s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=441.14s)]
*  They've only been doing this for nine straight years. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=442.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=444.86s)]
*  When you start having Gestapo raids in America and we start becoming a country where, as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=446.2s)]
*  in East Germany, a knock on the door is the thing people are thinking about instead of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=452.64s)]
*  the brilliant idea they want to go create, then we are moving very, very far from the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=458.56s)]
*  president worrying about what regular people need. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDprgkM8KwI&t=467.15999999999997s)]
