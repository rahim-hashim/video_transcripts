# The Democratic Party is 'PHONY' and 'INAUTHENTIC': Lara Trump
**Fox News:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo)
*  Joining us now RNC co-chair Laura Trump. It was great to see you in Milwaukee. I'm kind of surprised you're not here in Chicago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks a lot. You abandoned us. I appreciate it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=7.2s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't get the invite Sean. It's shocking, but I'm glad you're there for all of us. So good luck [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=10.4s)]
*  Good luck. Nice knowing you. Good luck [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=16.6s)]
*  A couple of people that were pretty vocal and all I said was hello. Very nice to meet you [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=20.04s)]
*  Putting all of that aside so I want to go over this challenge and that is the real Kamala Harris and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=24.68s)]
*  Anybody that has been watching my show on a regular basis knows that there is I mean [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  I have never seen the volume of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=37.72s)]
*  Radical statements that have come out of a candidate and and their running mate then with Kamala and Tim walls [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=41.64s)]
*  The question the problem is right now [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=48.08s)]
*  John McLaughlin saying anywhere between 70 and 80 percent of the people they polled [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=50.4s)]
*  They're not aware of that side of her so they're going and the media is not going to point it out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=55.08s)]
*  So that then becomes an issue for the campaign and for the RNC, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. That's our job over the next 78 days [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=65.68s)]
*  Sean we have to tell the American people exactly who Kamala Harris is and look [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=69.04s)]
*  She just came out on stage there in front of the nation at the DNC her first appearance and told you absolutely [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=73.68s)]
*  Nothing. I it was it was actually kind of shocking to me what I think people have at least learned thus far [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  If they don't know yet Kamala Harris is radical positions Tim waltz is radical positions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=87.2s)]
*  They know that this party and these candidates Sean are very phony. They're very inauthentic [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=91.84s)]
*  Look at Donald Trump two days before our convention. He shot in the head. He shows up at our convention [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=97.2s)]
*  He's there every single day. He's there for all the major speeches [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=103.6s)]
*  This is a man who sometimes is transparent some might say to his fault [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=107.08s)]
*  But you never have to wonder who Donald Trump is where he stands on anything or what he is thinking because he will tell you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=110.92s)]
*  On the other side of things you have a completely phony party and completely phony candidates in Kamala Harris [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=117.48s)]
*  And Tim waltz, I mean the whole thing is crazy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  You see the fact that they lied about Joe Biden for how long to us Joe Biden's fine [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=128.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's fine until Joe Biden is not fine. Now we all see what was going on there, of course and then you know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=134.0s)]
*  The the idea that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=140.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Tim waltz are somehow going to do anything different or better than the past four years folks [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=142.96s)]
*  You've had Kamala Harris right there alongside Joe Biden for three and a half years [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=149.4s)]
*  If you put this person in the White House alongside her running mate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=154.44s)]
*  It will be like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on steroids, you're right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=158.4s)]
*  That's what we have to convince the American people over the next 78 days [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=163.24s)]
*  Look out because we have to tell them you're right Sean. The mainstream media will not do this for us [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  It is frightening [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=172.28s)]
*  But the fact that we were there and we just heard for I guess it was two minutes from Kamala with absolutely no substance [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=173.4s)]
*  Nothing on policy. The only policy she has of course [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=178.8s)]
*  She ripped off from Donald Trump or straight out of communist playbooks is is terrifying and crazy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=181.28000000000003s)]
*  But we're gonna make sure the American people know exactly who this woman is come November 5th from the day you took your position [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=186.28s)]
*  by a question that I have asked you regularly had to do with Republicans and and a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=193.24s)]
*  Reluctance a resistance to early voting voting by mail legal ballot harvesting efforts and also a ground game [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=199.16s)]
*  these are the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=207.56s)]
*  These are things that it seems the Democratic Party has mastered and I would get you know [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=209.16s)]
*  Regular updates we're now 30 30 what one two days away from early voting beginning in Pennsylvania rolling out around the country and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=215.48s)]
*  Ballots now before that even be being mailed out to people around the country [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=222.88s)]
*  Where are we with early voting? Where are we with voting by mail? Where are we with ballot harvesting in the ground game? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=227.76s)]
*  Well, we want to convince every single Republican voter out there. You cannot wait Sean until Election Day [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=235.2s)]
*  If we all wait until Election Day, it's too late life happens [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=240.76s)]
*  I have two kids Luke and Carolina. They're there my daughter's birthdays today. She just turned five. My son is six [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Everybody knows what happens in life get your vote banked early [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  We have put together the most aggressive election integrity program in the history of America [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  So that you know, no matter if you vote by mail no matter if you vote early or on Election Day your vote matters [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=257.68s)]
*  And your vote counts we have a hundred and fifty seven thousand people that we have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=263.44s)]
*  Gotten on our volunteer team to be part of this program protect the vote comm if anyone wants to be part of it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=267.86s)]
*  We want you to come help us, but you're right. We cannot continue to play the game the same way Sean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  We have to do ballot harvesting everywhere. It's legal. We have to do ballot chasing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=279.26s)]
*  We have to have campuses out across this country [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=283.0s)]
*  Engaging with low propensity voters and that is exactly what you're going to see out of this RNC [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=286.06s)]
*  We've spent a lot of time messaging to to people all across America [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  Get your vote in early and then come help us recruit more people to get out to the the polls [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  That's how you make it too big to rig. That's how we swamp the vote [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=301.62s)]
*  That's how we're going to see victory on Election Day and we're very proud of what we put together [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  I think every single American no matter if you're voting Republican [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=309.86s)]
*  Democrats or third-party candidate when you vote in the United States of America [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  You ought to know your vote matters and your vote counts and that's what we've been working on since the day Michael Wotley [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=317.14s)]
*  And I took office. I think it's very important that people embrace that but I don't want to be very clear [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=322.38s)]
*  It's not the system that I want. I'd prefer Election Day be a national holiday. I would prefer that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=327.46s)]
*  We have paper ballots. I would prefer that we have [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=333.82s)]
*  Proof of citizenship voter ID signature verification chain of custody controls [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=337.94s)]
*  I would prefer that we have updated voter rolls and partisan observers in every precinct in the country [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=342.7s)]
*  Watching the voting all day and the vote counting all night, but that's not the system we have but the only way you're gonna change it is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=348.88s)]
*  If in fact you are able to win elections, that's the only way you change it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=355.92s)]
*  Anyway, Laura Trump good to see you. We appreciate it and wish you were here with us in Chicago [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ExMPBYJ9wo&t=361.44s)]
