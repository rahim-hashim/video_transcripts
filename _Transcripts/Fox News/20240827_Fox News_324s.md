# Vivek Ramaswamy: This is indefensible
**Fox News:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E)
*  The presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=0.0s)]
*  is now slated for September 10th, as we've been telling you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=5.8s)]
*  It's supposed to be on the very extremely radically liberal George Stephanopoulos network [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=9.16s)]
*  of ABC News. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=14.08s)]
*  But President Trump is already speaking out about ABC and their hostility towards his [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=15.74s)]
*  campaign and blasting Kamala Harris for trying to change the debate rules. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=20.54s)]
*  They're even, by the way, suing George Stephanopoulos. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, Politico is reporting the Harris campaign wants hot mics because they believe the VP [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=27.84s)]
*  can, quote, get Trump to lose his cool and say something, well, in politic on mic. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=32.84s)]
*  Because even with moderators on her side, Harris still can't answer questions or discuss [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=40.24s)]
*  policy positions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=44.4s)]
*  So just relying on Trump to make a mistake. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=45.68s)]
*  Here with reaction, former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=49.44s)]
*  Maybe you can settle the debate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=54.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=55.96s)]
*  This is their requested network. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  They get the moderators they want. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  They got the rules they demanded. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  And last minute now, they want a rule change. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=65.44s)]
*  I think Donald Trump does what Donald Trump does best, and that's go in, art of the deal, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=69.6s)]
*  negotiate a second debate as part of a change. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=73.56s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=76.6s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think that a good option is to just show up at the Fox News debate, and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=77.6s)]
*  if Kamala doesn't want to show up, tell the American people for an hour what your policy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=81.64s)]
*  vision actually is for the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=85.1s)]
*  The truth of the matter is, Sean, let's cut to the bottom line. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=87.86s)]
*  There are going to be debates between now and November, and I think it's going to be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  a great opportunity. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=93.38s)]
*  The Wednesday after the day of that date that she rejected, I'm doing a town hall with President [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Trump in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  So you know, he's great. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=104.94s)]
*  I think it's what we need is more authentic interaction with or without a moderator. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=106.46s)]
*  I think that's what we need in the country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  The reality, Sean, though, is how the media is covering for Kamala Harris's policy positions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=112.9s)]
*  Her policy deficits are the equivalent of Biden's cognitive deficits in that the media [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=117.5s)]
*  has covered up for both of them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=122.06s)]
*  The reality is when she says there's a tax on unrealized capital gains that she favors, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=124.26s)]
*  they say don't worry, that'll never pass. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=128.66s)]
*  Abolishing private health insurance or the ban on fracking or on offshore drilling, she [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  no longer supports that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=135.34s)]
*  So whatever it is, what you really hear from the media is not a defense of her actual policies, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  because so many of them, including the price controls, are indefensible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=141.9s)]
*  All they'll say is don't take it seriously because it's never going to actually pass. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=145.22s)]
*  That's why I think the debate is actually important. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=149.38s)]
*  It forces Kamala Harris to own what her policy positions actually are. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that we are under 75 days to an election, where we don't even know where [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  one of the two major presidential candidates stands on each of these issues, is I think [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=160.94s)]
*  an actual undermining of American democracy that nobody's talking about. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=165.46s)]
*  Her campaign, according to Axios, is now saying, after we heard her policies that did not go [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=170.82s)]
*  over well, even with The Washington Post and The New York Times about price gauging or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=176.82s)]
*  the fact that she laid out the largest tax increase in the history, not only of the country [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=183.06s)]
*  but the world, and you mentioned unrealized capital gains, that sheâ€”they don't want [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=188.56s)]
*  to put out any more policy positions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=195.5s)]
*  There's nothing on her website about where she stands. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=197.5s)]
*  On my website, I have her, in her own words, telling everybody where she stands, but we [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=200.94s)]
*  don't know if she's standing by her previous statements. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=205.82s)]
*  So I'm not even sure, in a 90-minute debate, that you can get out that kind of information. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=209.7s)]
*  It seems to me that we're going to have to bypass the corrupt media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=216.4s)]
*  One of the reasons I respect even principled left-wing liberals, who have different views [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=221.7s)]
*  than mine, like Bernie Sanders, is at least they will own their actual policy positions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=225.9s)]
*  We don't get that out of Kamala Harris. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=230.38s)]
*  But the truth is, the more she talks about policy, the more she goes down in the polls, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=232.48s)]
*  so they've taught her to stay away from it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  It's our job now as a Republican party, all the way up and down, to say here is our alternative [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  vision. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=242.26s)]
*  She's not talking about policy where we can draw sharp contrast by saying we're the ones [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=243.26s)]
*  that actually do have a vision for the country, sealing the border, ending rampant crime, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=247.42s)]
*  growing the economy, and staying out of World War III. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=252.26s)]
*  Those are policies that most Americans agree with. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=255.54s)]
*  One of the things I respect about Donald Trump, this cycle in particular, is that he offered [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=258.26s)]
*  real clarity on how to achieve those things. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=261.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris hasn't. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=264.34s)]
*  That's the contrast. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=265.34s)]
*  But on day one, she's going to solve the inflation problem that she said was transitory and secure [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=267.18s)]
*  the border, which she told us was secure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=272.42s)]
*  You didn't hear that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=275.94s)]
*  Well, the reality is, the reality is, on day one, this is almost Orwellian, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=276.94s)]
*  You say the opposite thing enough times, you hope the voting public doesn't actually notice. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=281.44s)]
*  On solving inflation, her plan of bringing Venezuelan-style price controls to the United [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=285.58s)]
*  States, we know where that story ends. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=289.78s)]
*  They actually had worse undernourishment crises in nations like Venezuela after using price [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=292.1s)]
*  controls. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=296.9s)]
*  We don't want that in the United States of America. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=297.9s)]
*  We don't want to turn our nation into Venezuela, either through illegal migration or their [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=299.94s)]
*  failed economic policies. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=303.7s)]
*  Let's do it the American way, and that's what Donald Trump's going to give us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3jLZ7NK3E&t=305.5s)]
