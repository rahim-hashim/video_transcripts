# Former White House doctor: A cognitive test from Biden would be a 'miserable failure'
**Fox News:** [July 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. We'll have more reaction to President Biden's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=0.0s)]
*  exclusive interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in just a moment. But first, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the media is raising new questions tonight about Biden's cognitive decline. There was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=12.16s)]
*  a blockbuster piece in New York magazine yesterday. It was by reporter Olivia Newsy, and it made [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  several disturbing claims about the president, including that he does not recognize old family [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=23.52s)]
*  friends or top donors, that his hand felt cool in a noticeably hot room, and that he [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=29.92s)]
*  once looked to her like quote, something not of this earth, with slow speech, a waxy face [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=36.84s)]
*  and eyes that were open, but not on. Newsy writes that Biden was overly protected by [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=43.84s)]
*  staff as far back as the 2020 campaign and has recently been quote, cocooned within mounting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=50.02s)]
*  layers of bureaucracy and in an apparent effort to hide his condition from the public. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=55.62s)]
*  Here with their analysis are Texas Congressman Ronnie Jackson, the former White House doctor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  and Fox News medical contributor Dr. Mark Siegel. You know, Congressman Ronnie Jackson, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=65.5s)]
*  so you were the White House doctor for former President Trump and former President Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=71.46s)]
*  always, he must have done it a dozen times when I was in his presence, recounted when [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=76.42s)]
*  he took a cognitive test in vivid detail. It's like he had memorized the cognitive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=81.9s)]
*  test and, you know, would tell people about it. I just was very struck tonight when Biden [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=86.06s)]
*  was asked four times, will you take a full neurological test? I have that every day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  Will you take a specific test with a specialist? No, they said I'm good. Are you willing to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  undergo a test? Look, I have a test every day. Will you do it to reassure them to which [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  he said, watch me? Well, we all watched and a lot of people think he should take that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=106.4s)]
*  test. So why won't he? Well, you know, he won't take it, Kayleigh, because obviously [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=110.34s)]
*  it's going to be a miserable failure. I mean, he would, he would do absolutely horrible [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=115.5s)]
*  on the test of that nature. And he knows it, his team knows it. They've been avoiding it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=118.78s)]
*  for a long time. I mean, we watch him every day. I think most people in this country have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=122.58s)]
*  known for a long time that he's cognitively impaired and that he has no business whatsoever [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  being our commander in chief and being in charge. But this, this recent debate was on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=130.9s)]
*  such a grand scale. The one thing it did was it took the people that have been protecting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=135.22s)]
*  for the longest time, which is the mainstream media and the liberal left, it made it to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=139.38s)]
*  where they can no longer defend him. But, you know, to your point about this article, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=143.94s)]
*  this is a huge cover up at this particular point. And we need to get to the bottom of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=147.98s)]
*  this as a member of Congress. When I get back, I'm going to, I'm going to start pushing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  for us to have some congressional oversight here. We need to have a hearing. We need to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=154.42s)]
*  get people in. We need to get Dr. Kevin O'Conner in. Like I'll ask you, Kelly, why, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  why have not we heard from this man the entire time that he's been president? We have not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=162.42s)]
*  had this, this person who's the president's physician stand up at the podium before the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=166.7s)]
*  press and answer questions. You know, when I was president Trump's position, as you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=171.7s)]
*  remember, I stood up at the podium for well over an hour when I had everybody in their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=176.26s)]
*  dog coming after me asking me the most ridiculous questions. I answered every single question [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=180.7s)]
*  they had at objective data there at my side to, you know, to go over nothing was, it was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=184.94s)]
*  completely transparent. I had people like the great Sanjay Gupta, right? It was standing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=189.38s)]
*  there trying to tear me down. Suddenly today he's, he's out advocating for, for cognitive [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=194.26s)]
*  tests. Where has he been for three and a half years? Where has CNN and the New York [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Times and the Washington Post and you know, MSNBC and all these other networks, where [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=203.76s)]
*  have they been? This is a national security issue. I have been saying it for, and since [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  2020 in February, 2020, I started talking about this and I initially got criticized [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=214.06s)]
*  and called out by president Obama over it. And I've been criticized over and over for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=218.54s)]
*  saying this and now the whole world is seeing it and there's just no way around it. So yes, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  he needs to take a cognitive test. Although some people might make the argument it's too [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=227.66s)]
*  late for that now. We all know he's got a problem and I don't know if a cognitive test [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=231.34s)]
*  would change anybody's opinion at this particular point. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=235.06s)]
*  Well, you teed me up perfectly by mentioning the hostility of Sanjay Gupta of CNN toward [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=239.1s)]
*  you because, oh wait, he had this to say. Newsflash, let's play it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=244.34s)]
*  I think a lot of the things that people saw at that debate weren't necessarily new, but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  they were sustained and I think more pronounced than what we had seen in the past. If you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=255.02s)]
*  take a look, slow response time, I think we saw that sort of in a sustained fashion. Definitive [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=259.86s)]
*  word retrieval mix-ups, rambling, sometimes confused speech, reduced voice volume as well [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=266.86s)]
*  and reduced facial movements. And these things can all be connected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=275.1s)]
*  I mean, Dr. Siegel, that's the CNN doctor calling for this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, listen, listen, Kayleigh, we've been talking about this for four years. I talked [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=286.54s)]
*  about this with President Trump when I interviewed him back in 2020 in July. The issue isn't [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  about a single, single cognitive test. As Ronnie Jackson just said, Congressman Dr. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=296.26s)]
*  Jackson just said, there's a big cover-up going on here and a cognitive test may not [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=302.06s)]
*  be the answer at this point because he's failed so many real life cognitive tests. And by [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=307.14s)]
*  the way, you know what happens in a situation like this? The patient is the last to admit [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=312.06s)]
*  it. It's not surprising that he says, I'm fine, I'm fine, I don't need a test. My doctors [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=317.46s)]
*  say I'm fine. Well, where are those doctors hiding behind this? And by the way, Ronnie [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=322.22s)]
*  Jackson didn't mention the yearly physical, which always looks like there's nothing to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=327.62s)]
*  hide. Neurologists examined him, they say. Neurologists examined him, but we've never [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=332.02s)]
*  seen an MRI report. We've never seen a cognitive test. And now it's four years later from where [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=336.5s)]
*  we first started talking about this. There's something called cognitive reserve. How much [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=342.06s)]
*  cognitive reserve do you have? If you haven't slept, if it's after 4 p.m., if you're disoriented [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=347.62s)]
*  a little bit, what do you act like if you're president of the United States, not just with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=354.36s)]
*  the nuclear codes, but with all of these decisions to make, what's your cognitive reserve, President [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=358.32s)]
*  Biden? And the whole world can see that it's extremely thin. There is no cognitive reserve. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=364.24s)]
*  And neurodegenerative diseases do not happen overnight. They progress over time. So when [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=369.72s)]
*  I was first asking about this, it was probably mild cognitive impairment. Now it looks more [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=374.6s)]
*  like full on dementia. And you're right. All the other doctors on TV that weren't asking for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=381.04s)]
*  this should be ashamed of themselves. And the president's own doctors should not have been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  hiding this. Public has a right to transparency. That's democracy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=390.6s)]
*  Yes. Dr. Jackson, you made so many great points. And look, when I was press secretary, the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=395.6s)]
*  White House doctor was there when Trump got COVID. And he went to reporters and he spoke with [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=401.72s)]
*  them and he gave me letters that he signed with medical updates. Something has been hidden. I only [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=407.76s)]
*  have a few moments here, but I was thrilled to hear you mention congressional oversight. Should [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  there be a select committee into this president's mental acuity? Because there are soldiers who are [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=416.0s)]
*  deployed abroad and we don't know if they're being protected with this level of mental acuity. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=421.28s)]
*  There absolutely should be at this particular point, Kayleigh, because we have someone who's in the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  office that's not making the decisions. And if you look at the disastrous results of this presidency [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=431.68s)]
*  with our economy and the border and the wars overseas and everything else, we need answers on [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=437.0s)]
*  how this happened. And there has been a cover up and we need to know who's been covered up and they [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=442.12s)]
*  need to be held responsible. This is completely unacceptable. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=447.08s)]
*  Yep. What did they know? When did they know it? Thank you both. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0bXd5JqVU&t=451.64s)]
