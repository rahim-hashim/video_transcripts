# Sean Hannity: Democrats continue to spiral
**Fox News:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I)
*  to some very disturbing news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=0.0s)]
*  If you watch this program, you know how pathetic and unhinged the Democratic Party has become. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=2.5s)]
*  But now some on the left are actually turning to outright violence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=9.32s)]
*  Others are now openly advocating to assassinate Elon Musk, who has become a lightning rod [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=12.96s)]
*  to these radicals, and really for two simple reasons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  One, he's working with and he's supported President Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=23.2s)]
*  Number two, he has been exposing and rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and I would argue, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=26.92s)]
*  when we get to the bottom of it, a lot of corruption within our federal government, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=31.76s)]
*  and what the D.C. swamp has been doing with your hard-earned money. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=36.36s)]
*  Now, because of these reasons, Democrats, they no longer care that he's going to rescue, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=39.72s)]
*  and I pray that this goes well, astronauts, you know, lost in space and kind of abandoned [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  from the International Space Station or helping those that were in need after Hurricane Helene [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  with Starlink terminals that he donated after the wildfires in California. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=56.68s)]
*  Again, he stepped up, he donated again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=61.24s)]
*  And they don't seem to care that he's working to restore vision to the blind and movement [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=64.8s)]
*  to those who are paralyzed and with spinal cord injuries with something called Neuralink. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=69.48s)]
*  Nor do they seem to care, the environmentally obsessive left Democrats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=75.64s)]
*  They don't even care that Elon Musk created, by far, the most successful electric vehicle [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=80.64s)]
*  company in the entire world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  In fact, threats and acts of terror against Tesla are now becoming common, and it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=86.44s)]
*  getting scary. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=92.0s)]
*  In Colorado, one Tesla dealership has been attacked multiple times since January. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=93.0s)]
*  At least one individual is now accused of trying to set the dealership on fire, hurling [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=98.28s)]
*  Molotov cocktails at cars, spray-painting the word Nazi on the building. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=102.96s)]
*  And this past Friday, there was yet another attempt to burn the dealership to the ground. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=107.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the state of Oregon, someone opened fire on a Tesla dealership there, firing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=111.88s)]
*  at least seven rounds, damaging cars, breaking windows. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=117.32s)]
*  And take a look at your screen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Just yesterday in Seattle, four Cybertrucks—you can see it right there—were torched near [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=122.4s)]
*  Boston. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=128.2s)]
*  More than six Tesla charging stations, they were set ablaze by the lunatic left. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=129.64s)]
*  And there have been reported acts of vandalism and violence against Tesla now all over the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=136.0s)]
*  country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  And sadly—I hate to ever report this about anybody, I don't really care what your politics [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  are—now Elon Musk himself is facing constant real death threats, including one woman on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  TikTok openly calling for his assassination while bragging she's not paid taxes in seven [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=153.38s)]
*  years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=159.2s)]
*  Other lunatics openly hold signs of protest calling for Elon's murder. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=160.2s)]
*  Just today, X was temporarily shut down because of a major cyberattack, according to Musk [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=164.76s)]
*  himself. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=171.04s)]
*  Quote, there was, still is, a massive cyberattack against X. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=172.04s)]
*  We get attacked every day, but this was done with a whole lot of resources, either a large [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=176.12s)]
*  coordinated group and or a country is involved. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=181.32s)]
*  Now, contrary to the incredibly dumb talking points from Democrats, Elon Musk is leading [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=185.0s)]
*  Doge, you know, and he's losing money in the process. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=190.44s)]
*  He's not doing this to make money. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=193.96s)]
*  He's losing it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=195.76s)]
*  And you can see now, you know, all these attacks have led to the demonization of him, and it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=197.4s)]
*  hurting his business. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=203.0s)]
*  And, you know, his important work for the Trump administration is bad for business, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=204.0s)]
*  and Tesla's stock is down. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=209.72s)]
*  His companies and products are under constant attack, all because he is daring to expose [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  waste fraud, abuse and auditing the federal government. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=217.88s)]
*  And by the way, you know what? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=222.28s)]
*  I hate what—personally, I hate what they're doing to this guy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to go out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=226.92s)]
*  A friend of mine has a Tesla. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=227.92s)]
*  I've driven it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=229.72s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=230.72s)]
*  It's a great car. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=231.72s)]
*  And I just, frankly, want to support someone who has given up an awful lot to help our [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=232.72s)]
*  president, help our country, save us a ton of money and get us on the right track. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=239.2s)]
*  And by the way, according to Kelley Blue Book and others, Tesla is the single most American-made [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=245.44s)]
*  car in the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  In other words, more American party—over 80 percent of the car is American-made. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=253.2s)]
*  Those are American jobs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=257.72s)]
*  All these lefties attacking Tesla, they're going to lose high-paying career jobs for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=259.4s)]
*  people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=265.72s)]
*  And as I said last week, the Democratic Party is completely soulless in spite of Hakeem [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=266.72s)]
*  Jeffries. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=271.28s)]
*  We've got him on the run. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=272.28s)]
*  We'll get to that later in the program. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=273.28s)]
*  Now, we witnessed this last week when Democrats, they wouldn't stand for mothers that lost [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=274.56s)]
*  their children or a 12-year-old young man that survived cancer or the wife of a law [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=278.72s)]
*  enforcement officer that was killed or a young man that lost his father and is now going [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=284.04s)]
*  to West Point. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  They couldn't bother to stand and clap for any of them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  And whether or not you like Elon Musk, he's right about, you know, simple truths and a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=292.04s)]
*  simple fact. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=296.48s)]
*  The United States, our country, is spending itself into oblivion. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=297.48s)]
*  We will not survive as a country if we keep spending like this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  We keep robbing from our children and grandchildren. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=307.0s)]
*  And this is your money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  And the average American makes $66,000 a year, and they're spending and wasting hundreds [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  of billions of your dollars. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=316.08s)]
*  Keep in mind, the federal pre-COVID budget was $4.5 trillion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  It is now over $6 trillion after Biden's wild four-year spending spree. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=322.24s)]
*  Now, think about that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=327.56s)]
*  The pandemic's long been over. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=328.56s)]
*  Spending levels never went down under Joe and Kamala. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=330.44s)]
*  Now that brings us to a Hannity investigation into what Joe and Kamala were doing with your [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=333.8s)]
*  money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=337.88s)]
*  Let's start with Stacey Abrams. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=338.88s)]
*  She apparently was granted a $2 billion contract to buy energy-efficient appliances for low-income [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  Americans. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=345.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=346.8s)]
*  I led a program called Vitalizing Desoto. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=347.8s)]
*  We worked in a tiny town in South Georgia to demonstrate that by replacing energy-inefficient [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=351.44s)]
*  appliances with efficient appliances, you can lower your cost. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=359.36s)]
*  And based on that program, a coalition of organizations, famous organizations, came [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=362.72s)]
*  together and said to the EPA, if we can do this here, we can do this for millions more [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=369.48s)]
*  Americans. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=376.36s)]
*  Let us invest the money of America in lowering the cost for Americans. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=377.36s)]
*  And the EPA said, OK, great, go for it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=382.16s)]
*  Now, sadly, that is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, Biden's trillion-dollar American Rescue Plan spent almost no money on COVID [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  recovery, instead cheated and created this giant slush fund for state and local governments, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=393.04s)]
*  including billions for California and New York and other deep blue states. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=398.92s)]
*  Billions went to housing illegal immigrants that they allowed unbedded into the country. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=403.44s)]
*  New libraries, $2 billion, was sent to nonexistent country-level governments. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=408.68s)]
*  $400 million went to renovate state parks and trails in Michigan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=414.8s)]
*  Joe spent a whopping $15 million on a sports complex in New Jersey, nearly a million to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  build luxury apartments in Connecticut. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=424.32s)]
*  $738 million went out to cover 500,000 convicted prisoners, including the Boston Marathon bomber. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  And get this, there were even $1,400 stimulus checks sent to Japanese citizens that were [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  living in Japan. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=440.4s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=441.8s)]
*  According to a study for the Center for Renewing America, more than $1.1 trillion was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  directed to programs infused with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, on top of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=448.44s)]

*  I mean, this is madness. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  We could spend all night talking about trillions of wasted taxpayer dollars, your money, that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=462.2s)]
*  Joe and Kamala burned through in the worst imaginable ways, causing inflation, high taxes, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=467.84s)]
*  economic suffering, and yet Democrats are violently angry with Elon Musk for trying [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=475.44s)]

*  They're, of course, insane. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, they're not just angry at Musk. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=488.67999999999995s)]
*  Anyone connected with Donald Trump faces an angry, left-wing, radicalized mob. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=491.08s)]
*  And of course, this includes the vice president and even his young family. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=500.88s)]
*  Ma'am, look at my three-year-old daughter now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=502.36s)]
*  And I told you, I talked to you for five minutes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  When you signed up for this, Joe, I was asked what you were doing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you needed to sign up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Why people are yelling at him? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  I did not agree to have my three-year-old to have people run around and yell at her. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=512.72s)]
*  And I did talk to you, and I said, if I talk to you for a few minutes, we will leave my [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=514.72s)]
*  three-year-old daughter alone and you see the end of the scene. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=518.72s)]
*  So I'd like you guys to respect that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=520.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=522.72s)]
*  Now, the vice president responded on an X. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=524.72s)]
*  He wrote, quote, today, while walking my three-year-old daughter, a group of protesters followed [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=526.72s)]
*  us around and shouted as my daughter grew increasingly anxious and scared, I decided [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=531.88s)]
*  to speak with the protesters in the hopes that I could trade a few minutes of conversation [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=536.52s)]
*  for them leaving my toddler alone. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  Nearly all of them agreed. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=543.52s)]
*  It was mostly a respectful conversation. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=545.0s)]
*  But if you chase in a three-year-old kid as part of a political protest, you know, you're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=547.12s)]
*  messed up. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=553.08s)]
*  Vance is absolutely right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=554.08s)]
*  But sadly, Democrats, they continue to spiral. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=555.32s)]
*  But according to Keem Jeffries, Republicans are on the run. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6IUeCm_0I&t=558.4s)]
