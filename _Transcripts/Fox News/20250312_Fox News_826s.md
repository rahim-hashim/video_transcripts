# Hannity: MSNBC should try telling the truth
**Fox News:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=0.0s)]
*  We start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=3.08s)]
*  After eight long months stranded in space, two American astronauts will soon, thankfully, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=5.04s)]
*  be coming home. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=10.84s)]
*  But not tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=11.84s)]
*  Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the launch of its Falcon 9 rocket because of a small hydraulic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=12.84s)]
*  issue. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=18.56s)]
*  But soon, the two stranded Americans will be retrieved, and that will be in the very [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=19.56s)]
*  near future. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=23.26s)]
*  Four other astronauts will take their place at the International Space Station, and this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=24.26s)]
*  will be a historic rescue operation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=29.08s)]
*  Now, according to Musk and one of the stranded American astronauts, it could have all happened [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  months and months ago if not for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=36.12s)]
*  Then President Biden turned down Elon Musk's offer to make the rescue because of political [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=40.12s)]
*  reasons. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=45.44s)]
*  They didn't want to give the win to Donald Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=46.44s)]
*  And yet, according to radical far-left Democrats, well, the guy bringing home our stranded astronauts [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=47.92s)]
*  is a villain. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=54.0s)]
*  You should not like him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=55.0s)]
*  In fact, some on the radical left are calling for Elon Musk. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=56.04s)]
*  This is getting really pathetic, and these people need to be discovered and arrested [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=59.04s)]
*  and prosecuted. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=63.2s)]
*  They're calling for his assassination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=64.2s)]
*  Others committing acts of outright terrorism against Tesla, dealerships, torching vehicles [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=66.48s)]
*  and charging stations, even shooting into showrooms. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=71.48s)]
*  In London, a group of far-left nutjobs pouring liquid latex over Tesla's state-of-the-art [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  robot, referring to it as a Nazi robot. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=80.8s)]
*  So why? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=84.52s)]
*  Why do they hate Elon Musk? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  For giving free communications to the victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina when [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  they had no connection with the outside world, or wildfire victims in California, for building [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=93.84s)]
*  a 1,000-horsepower, self-driving, an electric car that most American—that is, the most [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=100.32s)]
*  American-made car in the country, for simply helping President Trump for free, exposing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=107.24s)]
*  abuse, corruption inside our government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=113.72s)]
*  But the even bigger nutjobs on MSDNC, our old friends, Liberal Joe and company, they [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=116.44s)]
*  don't seem to have a problem with any of the left's extremism. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=121.76s)]
*  Instead, they are distraught that violent arsonists and rioters might be tried as terrorists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=124.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=130.72s)]
*  But then you also overnight have this post claiming that protests at Tesla dealerships [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=131.72s)]
*  are illegal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=136.56s)]
*  He said today he would label violence against dealerships domestic terrorism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=138.44s)]
*  So just to be clear, you protest a private company. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=142.84s)]
*  You are labeled by this administration a domestic terrorist. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  No, they are shooting—they're shooting bullets into showrooms. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  They're threatening assassination. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=154.28s)]
*  They are burning cars. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=156.56s)]
*  They are burning charging stations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=158.04s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a little different if you want to tell the truth at MSDNC. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=160.28s)]
*  Of course, this is NBC News. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=165.16s)]
*  But according to Democrats, if you walked into the Capitol building on January 6, everybody [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=167.68s)]
*  deserved to be locked up for years and years and years. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=172.58s)]
*  But of course, the summer of 2020, the 574 riots that killed dozens, injured thousands [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=175.84s)]
*  of cops, caused billions in property damage, oh, Kamala Harris, their candidate of choice, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=181.52s)]
*  they're not going to stop rioting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=186.56s)]
*  They shouldn't stop rioting, and we're not going to stop supporting them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=188.08s)]
*  But if you shoot at a Tesla dealership, you blow up a cyber truck, what, that's a peaceful [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=191.38s)]
*  protest, and should be honored and respected as free speech. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=195.6s)]
*  The left is up in arms over Elon Musk, the guy whose company is attempting to rescue [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=200.2s)]
*  American astronauts stranded in space by Joe and Kamala. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  And if Democrats hate Trump and Musk that much, maybe they should just follow old Rosie [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  O'Donnell's lead. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  That's right, sad news for the 12 or 13 or 14 Rosie O'Donnell fans across the country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  As we showed you last night, she is no longer living in the U.S. of A, in a desperate attempt [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=222.96s)]
*  to calm her anti-Trump rage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=227.6s)]
*  The fact that she's been triggered, Rosie has now moved to Ireland. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=230.22s)]
*  And this was funny. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=235.18s)]
*  Today, during a joint press conference at the White House, Ireland's prime minister [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=236.18s)]
*  was asked about his country's newest resident. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=239.86s)]
*  Let's take a look at this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=242.24s)]
*  Ireland is known for very happy, fun-loving people, great attitude, many in this room [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=243.24s)]
*  right now that I've met. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=250.24s)]
*  Why in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=251.24s)]
*  This is going to blow your happiness away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=254.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=256.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=257.88s)]
*  I like that question. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=258.88s)]
*  Do you know you have Rosie O'Donnell? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=259.88s)]
*  Do you know who she is? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=260.88s)]
*  Do you know who she is? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=261.88s)]
*  You better off not knowing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=262.88s)]
*  You better off not knowing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=263.88s)]
*  Having been on The View with her, I actually agree with the president. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=264.88s)]
*  Now, the president was in rare form today during a wide-ranging, frankly entertaining [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=265.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=281.28s)]
*  By the way, I have to speak of inflation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=282.28s)]
*  I love these socks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=287.28s)]
*  What's with these socks? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=288.28s)]
*  I'm trying to stay focused, but I'm very impressed with the VP's socks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=289.28s)]
*  I can't even see the socks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know what they look like. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=301.44s)]
*  Anyway, President Trump clearly upbeat, and for good reason. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=302.44s)]
*  In less than two months, a recurring theme has emerged from his second term. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=305.52s)]
*  It's simple, but it's profound. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=310.72s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=311.72s)]
*  Let's start at the border, where illegal immigration has almost completely stopped, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=313.72s)]
*  all while deportations are way up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=317.76s)]
*  Unlike the old border czar, and unlike Alejandro Mayorkas, Tom Homan and Kristi Noem actually [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=320.4s)]
*  know what they're doing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=326.68s)]
*  They're making no apologies for protecting the American people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=327.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=330.84s)]
*  You know, I always hear all the time, family separation, Homan's a godfather, Sam Rae [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=331.84s)]
*  and Sam Rae for separation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  Zero tolerance is about saving lives. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  When we figure we start prosecuting people who violate the law and put the children in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  harm's way, maybe they stop coming. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=345.52s)]
*  And they did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  Numbers went down. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  It's unfortunate families got separated. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  But it happens to American families every day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  It's going to happen in Albany today that American families will be separated by law [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=353.2s)]
*  enforcement because the child can't go to jail with a parent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  But you want to talk about family separation? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  A half a million children, Joe Biden, were trafficked into this country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=362.08s)]
*  They can't find 300,000 of them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  That's a separation. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  But you know what President Trump's committed? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  We're going to find them and we're going to save them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  It's over 300,000. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=373.56s)]
*  And by the way, he was heckled on his way into meeting some of these New York politicians. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=374.56s)]
*  And Borders R. Tom Homan will join us straight ahead tonight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=380.26s)]
*  But this brings us to yet another major promise made and promise kept by President Donald [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=383.12s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=388.08s)]
*  Tonight, I am happy to report prices are coming down. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=389.08s)]
*  That includes the cost of gas, which hasn't been this cheap in the month of March since [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  2021. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=396.8s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=397.8s)]
*  Dramatically. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=399.36s)]
*  Egg prices are also plummeting. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=400.36s)]
*  They are now cheaper than when Donald Trump took office. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=402.36s)]
*  Bye bye, left-wing talking point. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=405.0s)]
*  Interest rates on mortgages, they're also down, now dropping for the sixth consecutive [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  week and driving a spike in the real estate market. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=412.48s)]
*  Overall, inflation is now down with a new report that we're even better than expected. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=416.44s)]
*  And American manufacturing is once again on the rise, but don't take my word for it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=422.6s)]
*  This is what several business leaders and even fake news CNN are saying about the economy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=426.96s)]
*  You decide. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=431.28s)]
*  Manufacture is back. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=432.28s)]
*  If you believe that a supply chain bringing parts of cars across the border with Mexico [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=435.64s)]
*  or Canada seven times and this is efficient, this is not. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=441.32s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=446.52s)]
*  We've got to build in America. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=447.52s)]
*  We've got to produce things here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=448.8s)]
*  Finally, we have some good news on the economy and really the number one issue for many Americans, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=451.0s)]
*  the cost of living. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=455.28s)]
*  So we just learned that consumer prices in February increased by 2.8% year over year, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=456.28s)]
*  0.2% month over month. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=462.6s)]
*  Both of these figures were a step in the right direction and both were better than expected. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=464.76s)]
*  So this is definitely very encouraging to see. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=470.56s)]
*  One of the things that I do like is that the president is engaged with the business community. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=474.04s)]
*  The administration is engaged with the business community. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=478.68s)]
*  And that's a different experience than what we've had over the course of the last four [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=481.76s)]
*  years. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=485.04s)]
*  And because of the president's policies, Nissan and Honda, they were both going to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  build manufacturing centers in Mexico. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=490.12s)]
*  Now they're moving them to the U.S. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=493.12s)]
*  Apple is committed to now investing $500 billion in four years in Texas, building out a facility [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=494.76s)]
*  down there that will create tens of thousands of jobs. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=500.76s)]
*  A Taiwanese chip company, they're going to spend $100 million right here in the U.S. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=503.56s)]
*  As it turns out, the ongoing trade negotiations are not causing the sky to fall, as some on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=508.4s)]
*  the left have predicted. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=513.84s)]
*  Instead, Canada, the EU, are being held accountable for their unfair trade practices. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=515.36s)]
*  And that brings us to an ongoing Hannity investigation, and that's into tariffs and taxes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=521.0s)]
*  This is information the mainstream corrupt legacy media mob will never tell you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=526.16s)]
*  Keep in mind, Canada claims to be a proponent of free trade, but they have consistently [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=530.28s)]
*  levied maximum tariffs of 298 percent for our butter, 245 percent for our cheese, 241 [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=535.6s)]
*  percent for our milk. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=543.52s)]
*  What about dairy farmers in Wisconsin? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=545.2s)]
*  Should we not stand up for them? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=546.84s)]
*  Canada also imposes a 5 percent value-added tax, or national sales tax, on pretty much [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=548.64s)]
*  almost everything imported from the U.S. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=554.8s)]
*  And it's even worse with the European Union, a value-added tax ranging from 8 percent to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  over 25 percent. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=562.76s)]
*  The EU has also long imposed a 5.5 percent tariff on all U.S. goods. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=564.52s)]
*  So President Trump is rightly negotiating a better deal, so prices will go down for [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  you, the American people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  Is he supposed to sit there and just take it, like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=577.4799999999999s)]
*  do nothing? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's incentivizing all of this new manufacturing in the U.S. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  And let's also be clear, as we have seen over and over again, it'd never be a good [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=587.24s)]
*  idea to bet against Donald Trump. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=591.48s)]
*  How many bet against Zelensky coming back? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=593.64s)]
*  Hmm, a lot of people. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  How many people like us were telling you, he'll be back, and he was, and he will be, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  and guess what? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  These countries will negotiate, and you'll pay less. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, this was a president who oversaw what was record-breaking in terms of the economy [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=605.48s)]
*  in his first terms, historic gains in the economy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=610.6s)]
*  Look at those gains right there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=614.1999999999999s)]
*  Thanks to our friend Steve Moore, who will join us in a minute. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=616.2s)]
*  Record gains for the S&P, record gains for the Nasdaq, but apparently the Democratic [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=618.84s)]
*  Party wants to shut it all down, never mind the fact that he created record-low after [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=623.44s)]
*  record-low unemployment levels for every demographic—African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=627.96s)]
*  women in the workplace, African American youth unemployment. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=634.24s)]
*  Senate Democrats, they are now planning to block the House funding bill, shut down the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=637.88s)]
*  government on Friday. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=642.96s)]
*  This will be called the Schumer shutdown. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=644.48s)]
*  Get used to that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  Don't forget this, you know, this is their economic plan. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  We are currently living under the Democrats and the Biden and Harris economy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=651.3800000000001s)]
*  We need the CR to fund the government. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=656.8800000000001s)]
*  They didn't fund the government. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=658.96s)]
*  They didn't—Schumer never passed a single budget last year. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=660.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, he and his fellow Democrats and Biden and Harris, they are responsible for [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  all of this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=669.6400000000001s)]
*  Now, Friday, if the government does shut down, this will be on the Schumer radical Democrats. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  It will be the Schumer shutdown. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=676.2s)]
*  Schumer lives in fear and is capitulating to a radicalized party that refused to stand [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=678.2s)]
*  for the president at the joint session. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=684.0s)]
*  They wouldn't even stand for the first lady. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=686.76s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for mothers of slain children. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=688.48s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for a young man that survived cancer or the wife of a slain officer. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  Schumer and Jeffries orchestrated their silly, stupid, bingo card paddle response to the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=695.92s)]
*  president's address to the joint session. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=702.16s)]
*  They can't stand for working men and women. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  They're not going to fight for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=706.16s)]
*  Security. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=710.56s)]
*  The president has pledged to protect Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=711.56s)]
*  The only thing Schumer and company applauded for was endless war in Europe. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=715.88s)]
*  That was it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  And now, according to Democrats and their own words, all these innocent Americans will [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  suffer because they hate Donald Trump more than they care about government workers, and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=724.74s)]
*  they will cause the shutdown. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=730.42s)]
*  But however, if my memory serves me well, if I don't have Joe Biden-itis yet, Democrats [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=732.3s)]
*  used to think that government shutdowns are the worst thing on earth. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, now with the pending Schumer shutdown, I guess things have changed. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=743.1s)]
*  Let's remind you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=747.58s)]
*  When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=749.62s)]
*  It was underwater. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=758.5s)]
*  We all knew together that a government shutdown will be devastating, devastating to this country. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=760.26s)]
*  We are now less than a month away from a potential government shutdown. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=767.02s)]
*  Democrats use a government shutdown as a political tool to protest Donald Trump and Elon Musk's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=771.86s)]
*  efforts to defund and dismantle government agencies. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=777.42s)]
*  The strategy is to do whatever we can to stop Donald Trump. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=780.38s)]
*  Ah, so let's end this little monologue, shall we, with another question other than [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  hating Donald Trump. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=789.06s)]
*  Do Democrats truly believe in anything besides the right of men to play women's sports, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=790.66s)]
*  the rights of illegal immigrants over the safety of you, the American people, the right [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=796.4599999999999s)]
*  to waste hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars abroad on their radical DEI-woke [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=801.22s)]
*  transgender radicalism? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=807.34s)]
*  Or do they just have a constant thirst for power, using your money for their influence? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqe_i6Rx7OI&t=809.78s)]
