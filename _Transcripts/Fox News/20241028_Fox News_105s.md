# Why Republicans ‘have to flip’ this state for control of the Senate
**Fox News:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews)
*  All right here now with more on this upcoming Senate race, the one in Montana. We have Republican candidate Tim Sheehy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=0.0s)]
*  and he is running against incumbent Democrat John Tester, another reliable Harris Biden supporter. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=6.72s)]
*  What's going on on the ground in Montana? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=13.92s)]
*  Well we're winning Sean and we're winning because of common sense. Montanas want to take this country [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=17.52s)]
*  back. They want to restore common sense. They want a secure border, safe streets, cheap gas, cops are [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=21.68s)]
*  good, criminals are bad, boys are boys, girls are girls. Pretty simple stuff. We've got to focus on that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=26.96s)]
*  We're leading the polls right now but it's pretty tight. So go to timformt.com to learn more, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=32.08s)]
*  learn about the race, send us some support. We have to flip this seat. Donald Trump needs a Senate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=36.24s)]
*  when he gets to the White House. This last Senate, to include John Tester, voted to impeach Donald [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=40.8s)]
*  Trump not once but two times. Two times they voted to impeach Donald Trump and impeded his agenda [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  every step of the way and of course they voted for the Biden-Harris agenda every single step of the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=51.2s)]
*  way. Donald Trump's going to need a Senate when he gets there. We can give it to him here in Montana. Help us out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=55.44s)]
*  Well it's an important race and you've taken a very commanding lead in Montana and that is now [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=61.36s)]
*  leaning heavily red. You've been running a great campaign and I urge people, you know anybody really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=67.12s)]
*  for that matter, if you're going to vote for Donald Trump you've got to give him the biggest majority [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  he can have in the Senate and the biggest majority in the House so that the agenda can be passed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=78.0s)]
*  That is equally important. If you stop at the top when you're voting, which I did not do in Florida, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=84.0s)]
*  you make it a big mistake. Anyway, Tim Sheehy, thank you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0WYzUvews&t=89.2s)]
