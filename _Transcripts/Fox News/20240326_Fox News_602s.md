# Sean Hannity: This is sad and pathetic
**Fox News:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic)
*  But we start with Joe Biden himself. Now, before the president and vice president departed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=0.0s)]
*  on separate planes for an event in North Carolina, well, Joe did try to offer some brief remarks [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=4.96s)]
*  on the tragic bridge collapse that took place in Baltimore. Here is the sad and pathetic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=10.6s)]
*  part. As per usual, Biden made it all about himself, and yet another tall tale about his [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=16.2s)]
*  own personal connection to that bridge, which didn't exist. We'll tell you in a minute. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=22.8s)]
*  At about 1 30, a container ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which I've been [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=29.36s)]
*  over many, many times, commuting from the state of Delaware. They're a trainer by car, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=34.32s)]
*  been in Baltimore Harbor many times. All right. Big problem. You see, there's no railroad [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=39.6s)]
*  on the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and there would be no reason for Joe Biden to cross it on his way [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=46.8s)]
*  to D.C. But like every other national tragedy, whatever this issue is, Joe Biden always seems [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=53.6s)]
*  to find a way to make it all about himself. Remember, he did this with Afghanistan after [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=60.96s)]
*  the horrific withdrawal, lying about his own son dying in Iraq. It never happened. He did something [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=65.76s)]
*  similar after the devastating wildfires, if you recall, in Hawaii, embellishing what was a tiny [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=73.04s)]
*  little house fire in Delaware. Why? To one up the suffering, the disaster that was happening to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=79.44s)]
*  people in Maui. He nearly lost his precious Corvette. Oh, geez, the vapors, the horrors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=86.96s)]
*  And he did the same thing in Florida, if you recall, after a hurricane. He also frequently [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=93.28s)]
*  lies about his struggles during the civil rights movement. He lied about getting arrested, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=98.08s)]
*  protesting apartheid in South Africa. He lied about his time as middle class Joe on Amtrak. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=103.44s)]
*  And according to Joe Biden, no one knows the struggle and sacrifice like Joe Biden. Take a look. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=110.32s)]
*  Sunny Sunday. The lightning struck at home on a little lake that's outside of our home, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=117.44s)]
*  on a lake, a big pond, and hit a wire and came up underneath our home, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  into the heating ducts, the air conditioning duct. To make a long story short, I almost lost my wife, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=131.2s)]
*  my 67 Corvette, and my cat. I know from experience how much anxiety and fear and concern there are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=140.64s)]
*  in the people. We didn't lose our whole home, but lightning struck and we lost an awful lot of it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=149.68s)]
*  about 15 years ago. When Joe Biden, our elected president, entered the room, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=155.6s)]
*  when he approached me, his words to me were, my wife Jill and I know how you feel. We lost [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=162.0s)]
*  our son as well and brought him home in a flag-draped coffin. My heart started beating faster and I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  started shaking knowing that their son died from cancer and they were able to be by his side. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=176.08s)]
*  In reality, the guy who kept looking down at his watch during the dignified transfer of the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=182.24s)]
*  service members killed in Afghanistan because of his botched withdrawal and denied the existence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  of his own four-year-old granddaughter until it hurt him politically in the polls. He doesn't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  seem to really understand something called empathy and today Joe and Kamala, well they took a quick [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=201.36s)]
*  trip to North Carolina. It went, well, I guess about as well as you can expect with both of them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=206.8s)]
*  Take a look. You decide. Pretty incredible and so is Kamala. She's really incredible. I know it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=212.24s)]
*  sounds hard to believe. None of you kept, prayed God you had me have to go through that, but companies [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=218.0s)]
*  have stopped covering and that life was put in danger. 14 years ago this week, I stood by [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  President Obama when he signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Obamacare, and as many of you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=230.32s)]
*  know, I thought it was a big deal. Thank God my mom wasn't around. Folks, if America sends me a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=236.64s)]
*  congress that are democrats, I promise you Kamala and I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=250.32s)]
*  land again. I'm serious, this is what, if you didn't know any better, I think I'm making this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=256.64s)]
*  stuff up. We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=261.12s)]
*  in. The only country in the world. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. Not a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=266.32s)]
*  single thing. This is the United States of America. Not talking about the disaster at the bore, he's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=272.56s)]
*  not talking about the disaster about law and order and safety and security in towns and cities [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=279.36s)]
*  all across the country. He's not talking about the struggling economy, the 60 percent of our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=284.4s)]
*  fellow Americans living paycheck to paycheck, many Americans putting their bare necessities [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  on their credit cards. That's the only way they can make it every month and after struggling [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=295.28s)]
*  through that speech, Biden then seemed shocked and surprised that his vice president was even there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=299.76s)]
*  Biden's obvious cognitive decline is just one major problem that democrats will be facing in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=306.4s)]
*  November. In poll after poll, independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. is peeling off [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=312.48s)]
*  significant numbers of votes, most of them seemingly coming from Joe Biden. It makes sense [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=319.36s)]
*  that RFK Jr. is a traditional liberal progressive environmentalist, a once reliable democratic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  voter who now denounces Biden's insane policies at the border and has some belief in civil liberties. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  He's also not suffering from steep cognitive decline. I guess that's a huge plus. RFK Jr. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=339.12s)]
*  is definitely a left winger and loves, you know, lover of taxes, regulations, all things Obama, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=345.04s)]
*  Clinton, Biden, environmentalists, and that's a huge problem for the Biden campaign. They now [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=351.44s)]
*  set out, by the way, to go after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They will smear, slander, besmirch, attack [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  every second, every minute, every hour, they're not doing it against Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=365.28s)]
*  Now today, Kennedy announced his running mate, a Northern California lawyer and entrepreneur [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=369.52s)]
*  who really does embody the American dream. Her name, Nicole Shanahan, grew up extremely poor in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=374.96s)]
*  a single-family household. Her father suffered from mental illness and her mother, a Chinese [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=380.55999999999995s)]
*  immigrant, worked hard but struggled to make ends meet once relying on welfare, didn't want her kids [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  seeing when she was using food stamps in a store. She remembers her mother being ashamed of that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=391.76s)]
*  issue and asking her and her brother to leave so they wouldn't see that. At the age of 38, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=397.76s)]
*  Shanahan happens to be one of the wealthiest people in America. Nicole Shanahan, she has a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=403.2s)]
*  life story that anyone could be proud of, but she is a lifelong liberal Democrat from San Francisco. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=408.08s)]
*  She brags that she is a progressive, quote, through and through, and an environmentalist. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  Again, a huge problem for Biden and Harris. For example, take a look at Texas Democrats. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=420.88s)]
*  They have long dreamed of turning the Lone Star State blue for many years, even before [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=426.96s)]
*  Beto Bozo O'Rourke pranced onto the scene in 2020. Well, Trump won the state by about six points, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=432.48s)]
*  but now according to a new Marist poll, Trump is up by double digits, beating Biden in that state by [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=439.2s)]
*  11 points. Now, when you throw Robert Kennedy Jr. into the mix, Trump goes up by an even wider [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=444.72s)]
*  margin, with Kennedy peeling off 15 percent of the vote. And according to the Real Clear Politics [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=451.12s)]
*  Average, take a look at this. In a three-way race between Trump and Biden and R.F.K. Jr., Trump wins [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  Wisconsin by three, Georgia by seven, Arizona by six, Nevada by six, Pennsylvania by two. That means [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=462.88000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump will be elected the 47th president of the United States, if that holds. North [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=470.08s)]
*  Carolina by nearly seven, and Michigan by almost three points. It is very early. We are 223 days [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=475.12s)]
*  away, and anything can happen. And tonight, Trump isn't just faced with an intense political campaign. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=482.96s)]
*  As we have been talking about, we have a weaponized Justice Department. He is now forced to combat [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  that Department of Justice. And also, you have going on in New York and other places, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=497.44s)]
*  you have another left-wing judge, and Biden donor has imposed a gag order against Donald Trump, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=503.28s)]
*  ahead of Alvin Bragg's bizarre criminal case against the former president over documents that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=509.36s)]
*  were allegedly mislabeled. Now Trump cannot even speak out in his own defense. He can't defend [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=515.28s)]
*  himself against political attacks stemming from the indictments. Of course, these conveniently [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=521.52s)]
*  handed down in the middle of an election. I thought we lived in the United States of America. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=527.36s)]
*  I thought we celebrated freedom of speech. Is this still America? Because I'm beginning to wonder. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=533.92s)]
*  Far-left courts in this country are out of control. They're doing this more and more, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=541.12s)]
*  silencing people and threatening people to say that they'll send them to jail if they dare speak [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  out in their own defense. Message is very clear. If the powerful government, their bureaucrats [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  in New York City, Washington, D.C., Fulton County, Georgia, they don't like your politics, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=557.92s)]
*  they don't like your last name, they're going to try and put you in jail. They want to take away [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  your property. They want to silence your dissent and ruin your life forever. Is that the country [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=567.6s)]
*  you want to live in? If Democrats are successful in 223 days in November, this chilling system of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=573.84s)]
*  justice, that will be coming to a town near you. If they can do this to Trump, they can do it to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZZYz4gUic&t=582.4s)]
