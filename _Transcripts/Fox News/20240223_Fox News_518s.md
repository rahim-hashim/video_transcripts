# Judge Jeanine: This whole thing is corrupt
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A)
*  All right, so it is crunch time for Fulton County, Georgia, DA Fannie Willis, as a judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=0.0s)]
*  now is weighing whether to remove her from her own racketeering case against former President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=5.38s)]
*  Donald Trump and several others because of her personal relationship with the outside [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  prosecutor that she hired to run it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=15.92s)]
*  They had great vacations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=18.56s)]
*  Now, sources are telling Fox News that the judge will hear testimony from another witness [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=19.88s)]
*  next week before asking both parties to present their final summaries and arguments at another [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=25.24s)]
*  hearing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=32.48s)]
*  So, well, then he has to decide, does Willis stay or does she go without her on the case? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=33.48s)]
*  Well, the whole thing could be very well falling apart before our eyes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  And as we wait for the judge's decision, while the House of Representatives, they continue [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=43.4s)]
*  their impeachment inquiry of President Biden with testimony from his brother, Jim, yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  in D.C., GOP lawmakers, well, telling reporters yesterday that, well, Jim actually contradicted [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  himself and did so with several times and several documents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=60.46s)]
*  One source telling Fox News that Jim Biden changed his story during the interview when [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=65.1s)]
*  presented with evidence that outright proved him wrong, his own signature. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, here with full reaction is the co-host of the five, our good friend, Judge Jeanine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=74.94s)]
*  Pirro. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=79.78s)]
*  People don't know this sometimes about you, and I would like to remind them of your background. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=80.9s)]
*  You are a DA, you are a law and order DA, but you also believed in equal justice and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=84.58s)]
*  application of our laws. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=90.92s)]
*  Let's talk about the ethics first of Fannie Willis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=93.02s)]
*  The idea of this inexperienced guy, 654,000 lavish vacations that I'm sure we both would [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  love to also be invited to. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=104.86s)]
*  Look, when it comes to Fannie Willis, I have to tell you, first of all, I don't know any [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  DA who's taken six vacations in five months. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=113.06s)]
*  Who the heck is running the office? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  But then again, if you look at crime in Atlanta, Georgia, you get it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=117.58s)]
*  But that's another issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=121.26s)]
*  She is in the middle of a scenario where it appears that she benefited as a result of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  her hiring her lover that her former best friend, who is no longer her best friend, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=128.66s)]
*  she was involved with from 2019, more than two years before she's admitting to it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=134.22s)]
*  And you know what else is interesting, Sean, is that her father said he knew about all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=139.62s)]
*  her boyfriends, but he didn't know about Wade. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  And the reason he didn't know about Wade is because she hid that from everybody. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  It was a secret. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=152.54s)]
*  Now, the problem here is if you're giving $650,000 to your lover as a professional in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=154.18s)]
*  the office to try complicated RICO cases, when the guy's never tried a felony case in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=161.98s)]
*  his life, there's something that's off. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=167.42s)]
*  And then when this woman walks into a courtroom, she walked in as though she were the judge [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=170.02s)]
*  basically threatening everybody. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=174.78s)]
*  She pointed her fingers at the judge. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=176.54s)]
*  She yelled at the attorneys and said, don't you be cute with me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=178.74s)]
*  She was unresponsive. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=182.3s)]
*  She was contemptuous. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=183.7s)]
*  She was condescending. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=184.86s)]
*  I have never seen a more combative witness in my life. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=186.3s)]
*  And here's the concern, Sean. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=189.46s)]
*  This judge is supposed to hear from Terrence Bradley in camera. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=191.54s)]
*  He of course is a divorce attorney for her lover. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=195.14s)]
*  But whether or not any of that information ends up part of the judge's equation as to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=198.5s)]
*  the truth here, we don't know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=203.02s)]
*  But my fear is that this judge is such a wimp. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=205.1s)]
*  And I'm saying that with all due respect. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=208.7s)]
*  But I've been in court, I've been a judge, okay, just like he was a judge. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=211.18s)]
*  I've been a DA. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=214.62s)]
*  I have never seen a judge buckle like this judge buckled to that woman. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=215.78s)]
*  And if he is afraid of her, that's a problem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  He gave her a contribution to her DA campaign. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, some people say it's a big deal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=227.14s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  But the truth is in the fact that in that courtroom, she yelled at him and everyone [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  else and he was like a wimp just allowing everything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=234.5s)]
*  If it were me, she would have been on the paddy wagon with the other defendants on the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=237.98s)]
*  way to the county jail being held in contempt for disrupting my courtroom. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  Now, as it relates to Jim or Joe Biden, well, you've got a classic situation there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=247.17999999999998s)]
*  The Biden say, no, we've never done anything wrong. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  We've got 24 million dollars that we divvied up among 20 shell corporations among nine [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=256.3s)]
*  Biden recipients. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=261.9s)]
*  And the truth is that we just did it on our own. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=263.5s)]
*  There was no influence peddling. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  There was no corruption. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=268.18s)]
*  But by the way, I was never in business with Hunter or my brother, except they show him [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  a contract and they said, here's your signature. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=274.74s)]
*  He said, oh, I forgot. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=277.3s)]
*  Maybe you forgot about the contract, but don't you dare try to pull the wool over America's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  eyes and tell us you forgot you were in business with people from whom you got money that went [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=283.7s)]
*  through shell corporations that you got. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=288.9s)]
*  And then you then gave money to your brother, Joe Biden, and called it repayment of a loan [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  for which there was no payment schedule. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is so corrupt. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  To answer your original question, there is two systems of justice in this country and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  we're fed up with it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, Judge, I got to tell you something. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  I thought Jonathan Turley wrote a great piece. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=310.22s)]
*  It was in the New York Post today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=311.98s)]
*  One wire does not exonerate the family. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  Now, I'm pretty angry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=316.66s)]
*  This is now the second time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=318.22s)]
*  Christopher Steele was the first case. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  Now we have this informant working for the FBI since 2010. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=322.54s)]
*  Well-trusted source, reliable source. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=326.98s)]
*  We were told over and over again. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=330.18s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, this guy ends up not being so trustworthy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=332.5s)]
*  Again, they actually used Christopher Steele's dirty dossier that Hillary paid for, but not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=337.58s)]
*  one but four FISA applications. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=343.62s)]
*  It was the bulk of information. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=345.58s)]
*  Now you have this case here, but there's a very big difference. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=347.7s)]
*  This was only one tiny piece of the case against what I call the Biden family and the Biden [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=350.6s)]
*  family syndicate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=356.62s)]
*  It's a much bigger purview that we are talking about here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't explain the Burisma firing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  Why did Joe, why did Joe get the prosecutor fired? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=366.38s)]
*  Why was Hunter paid for a job he had no experience in at a time he says he was addicted to drugs? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  What about the CEFC deal? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=374.88s)]
*  What about the WhatsApp message? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=377.06s)]
*  What about 10 Biden family members paid? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=378.94s)]
*  What about up to 20 million so far identified? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=381.44s)]
*  What about what James Comer calls shell corporations? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=384.86s)]
*  It doesn't explain any of that or have anything to do with the vast overwhelming 98% of this case. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=388.92s)]
*  And you know whether your frustration is stemming from Sean, and it's my frustration as well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=394.72s)]
*  First of all, your analysis is spot on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=399.56s)]
*  You got this guy Smirnoff, who was a respected confidential informant for 10 years by the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=402.44s)]
*  FBI. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=407.88s)]
*  They paid him money. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=408.88s)]
*  He was so credible. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=410.42s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, a couple months ago, they decide, oh, he's not credible because [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=411.92s)]
*  he's involved in claiming that, you know, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were engaged in a problem. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  But that's just one piece of the pie. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=421.84s)]
*  There's so much other evidence. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=424.08s)]
*  Whereas Christopher Steele created a lie to spy on a presidential candidate and a president. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFudBW40C0A&t=426.15999999999997s)]
