# Rep. James Comer on what it would mean if Hunter Biden pleads the fifth
**Fox News:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs)
*  And here with more is the House Oversight Committee Chairman, James Comer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, a lot of breaking news tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=3.6s)]
*  Was a new subpoena issued or did they just agree to comply with the old one? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=6.48s)]
*  We issued a new subpoena because we wanted to make sure everything was done right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=12.08s)]
*  The old subpoena had an old date, so we make sure every I is dotted and T is crossed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=15.64s)]
*  And because we've done this investigation the right way, we're getting everything we [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  wanted. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=23.32s)]
*  We wanted Hunter Biden to come in and answer questions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=24.32s)]
*  We have a lot of questions and now he's going to have to come in and sit down and answer [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=26.92s)]
*  specific questions about specific transactions, specific meetings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=30.92s)]
*  He's going to have to answer to interviews that we've conducted with some of his former [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=35.72s)]
*  associates and we're going to see what level of involvement Joe Biden had in these Biden [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=40.0s)]
*  family schemes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about what do you think the odds are that he's going to want to plead the fifth [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=48.44s)]
*  and his attorney, Abbey Lowell, is not going to let him say a word. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  That's a possibility, correct? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=55.2s)]
*  It is a possibility, but look, they've been saying, they've been doing all these publicity [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=57.24s)]
*  stunts saying they wanted to get the truth out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=61.56s)]
*  They wanted to speak publicly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, all right, you're going to come in for this deposition. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=66.2s)]
*  You're going to have an opportunity to answer questions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=68.56s)]
*  Hunter Biden is going to have an opportunity to defend his good name. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=71.04s)]
*  And if he pleads the fifth and refuses to answer the questions, I think the American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  people can assume that this family has been on the tape for a long time from our enemies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=78.28s)]
*  around the world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  We're going to give Hunter Biden due process. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=85.16s)]
*  He's going to come in. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=86.84s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, this is a huge victory for the House Oversight Committee. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=87.6s)]
*  This is exactly what we wanted. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=92.36s)]
*  And Hunter Biden learned that when you do things the right way, that you don't get to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=94.12s)]
*  make your own rules. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=99.72s)]
*  We're treating him like... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=101.16s)]
*  Go ahead, Sean. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=103.16s)]
*  You're treating him like like everybody else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=104.28s)]
*  I got it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  All right, so it's going to be interesting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=108.64s)]
*  I don't know how you explain away a phone call just five days before his father goes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=111.0s)]
*  to Ukraine when he's in Dubai meeting with Burisma executives. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Burisma executives on the phone with Hunter and Joe Biden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=122.16s)]
*  And that's when Joe Biden later bragged about leveraging a billion taxpayer dollars to get [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=126.32s)]
*  a prosecutor fired because that was their big problem and they needed D.C. help. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=131.4s)]
*  The prosecutors fired. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=136.24s)]
*  And Hunter, who admitted he had no experience in energy, oil, gas, Ukraine, getting paid [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=137.64s)]
*  millions at a time when he's addicted to drugs on top of it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=143.32s)]
*  So that answer I would look forward to hearing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=147.48s)]
*  I'd like an answer on that, wouldn't you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=152.72s)]
*  And he's going to be asked that question. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=153.72s)]
*  He's going to be asked a lot of questions about China and Romania. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=154.72s)]
*  What exactly did you do to receive the millions and millions of dollars that our enemies around [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=157.16s)]
*  the world sent you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  What was the purpose for that money? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=163.32s)]
*  And if they're going to continue to play the loan card, are you going to pay the money [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=165.9s)]
*  back? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=170.5s)]
*  When you heard from Kevin Morris today, Hunter Biden doesn't have a job. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=171.5s)]
*  He doesn't have any assets. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=175.9s)]
*  He owes Kevin Morris at least five million dollars, if not more. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  We learned that today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  And according to what he told the bank, he owes China over five million dollars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=182.74s)]
*  The loan total with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden now, as I calculated, is fifteen million dollars. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=187.38000000000002s)]
*  We don't believe they're going to pay any of this back. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=194.06s)]
*  These are serious ethical issues and tax evasion issues that the Bidens are going to have to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  answer to. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=201.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, I was listening to Jamie Raskin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=202.38s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=206.22s)]
*  I mean, he's really just a political hack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=207.22s)]
*  But the idea, well, this was just a small percentage of his net worth, five million [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=209.78s)]
*  dollars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=214.62s)]
*  But wasn't it given at a very critical time leading into the 2020 election? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=216.74s)]
*  This could have been a big campaign issue if in fact Hunter had not paid his taxes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=222.66s)]
*  Wasn't that money, the original money used to pay back taxes? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=229.46s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=233.1s)]
*  And I think that's very important. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  We had an email today, courtesy of the IRS whistleblowers, that showed that Kevin Morris [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=236.48s)]
*  sent an email to the accounting firm saying, we've got a huge political problem here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=243.22s)]
*  This is in 2020 during the presidential campaign, Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=247.12s)]
*  We've got a huge political problem here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=251.42s)]
*  And the political problem was that Hunter Biden hadn't paid his taxes and the IRS was [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=253.66s)]
*  fixing to cart him off. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=258.54s)]
*  And that would have been very damaging to Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=259.94s)]
*  We believe that was a campaign finance violation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  We believe that the purpose of that money was to save Joe Biden's political career. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=265.74s)]
*  And look, Kevin Morris just met Hunter Biden. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=272.58s)]
*  And five weeks later, he's paying his IRS tax bills. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=276.74s)]
*  That's about the time of, from the time Kevin Morris met Hunter Biden to the time when he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=280.6s)]
*  paid the first installment to the IRS for what Hunter Biden owed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  That doesn't seem normal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=290.86s)]
*  And for Jamie, you're asking us to try to explain that that's okay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=292.44s)]
*  I think it's a bit of a stretch even for Jamie, you're asking. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=295.54s)]
*  And I guess he was a fan of Hunter's art because didn't he purchase some of the art? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  Did you talk about that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  Did you ever talk about the fact that Hunter, as far as we know, doesn't have a job? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't have any source of income. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=310.44s)]
*  If you give that much money, my understanding is you're only allowed to give somebody, I believe, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=312.68s)]
*  $15,000. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=320.04s)]
*  After that, it's taxable. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=321.24s)]
*  So if it's a loan, doesn't it have to be on paper? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=323.24s)]
*  Is there a paper trail? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  Is there interest payments that have to be made as well? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=327.8s)]
*  Is there a payment schedule, repayment schedule? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=331.0s)]
*  He said he had all that, but because he was also Hunter's attorney, he couldn't disclose that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=333.8s)]
*  Here's a guy saying he's his attorney and he's loaned him all this money. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=339.4s)]
*  And in California, I don't believe you're allowed as an attorney to loan your client money. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  Lots of ethical questions here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=347.88s)]
*  Lots of tax evasion questions. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=349.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=352.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=353.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=354.28s)]
*  Big breaking news. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=354.84s)]
*  February 28th, Hunter Biden goes in. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=355.96s)]
*  Well done. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1jsnHJfPs&t=359.15999999999997s)]
