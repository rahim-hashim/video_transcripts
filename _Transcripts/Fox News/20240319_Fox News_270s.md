# JD Vance:  The media is freaking out
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs)
*  Action is Ohio Senator J.D. Vance is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, good to have you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=3.52s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  So Joe Biden, the irony of all this, he chose a vice president that supported the rioting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=5.8s)]
*  in the summer of 2020, tweeted out the bail fund, and then went on Colbert and said, they're [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=12.48s)]
*  not going to stop, they shouldn't stop, I'm not going to stop, and that violence is going [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=17.64s)]
*  to continue, and ironically also called out the one person in the Democratic primary that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=21.88s)]
*  called him out for partnering with the former Klansman to stop the integration of public [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=28.2s)]
*  schools and busing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=34.44s)]
*  She said she was that girl, she was that person that was punished because of what Joe was [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=36.72s)]
*  trying to do. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=43.28s)]
*  Pretty ironic on both fronts, wouldn't you say? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=45.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say so, Sean. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=48.36s)]
*  The Democrats seem to not have great self-awareness on this stuff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=51.04s)]
*  They've been using violent rhetoric to describe their political opponents, not just for a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=53.72s)]
*  couple of cycles, but for decades. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=57.48s)]
*  And if we just go back to what President Trump said, one of the craziest things that I've [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=59.4s)]
*  seen today is that the Chinese, a Chinese car executive, Sean, promised a bloodbath [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=63.28s)]
*  in the American auto industry, literally echoing exactly what Donald Trump said. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=70.56s)]
*  And now the media is freaking out because he described a reality with actual true language. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=75.96s)]
*  If we don't stop Joe Biden's war on American auto workers and American cars, you're going [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=83.04s)]
*  to have a complete decimation of the jobs and the livelihoods in the state of Ohio that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=88.52s)]
*  rely on that auto industry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=93.56s)]
*  If you're in Michigan, if you're in Pennsylvania and your livelihood depends on the auto industry, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=95.14s)]
*  what are you more worried about? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=99.68s)]
*  Donald Trump telling the truth but using a word the media doesn't like, or the fact [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  that Joe Biden is coming for your job and coming for your livelihood? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=105.44s)]
*  This is so good for Republican Sean that they are hysterically reacting to what Donald [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=108.64s)]
*  Trump said, ignoring the fact that it's true and it rings true for a lot of voters all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=113.6s)]
*  across the heartland. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=118.64s)]
*  And this is the thing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=120.5s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about really high paying career jobs in the auto industry. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=121.5s)]
*  And look, if some people want to have electric vehicles, I'm all for it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=126.04s)]
*  If Tesla is hiring American workers and Elon Musk is hiring American workers, I don't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=131.18s)]
*  care what car he produces. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=137.88s)]
*  I'm happy that those Americans are successful, have a job, have a career, have a future, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=138.88s)]
*  can pay the rent, can pay the mortgage and pay for their kids' college and put food [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=143.56s)]
*  on the table. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=146.84s)]
*  But the same for gas-powered vehicles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=148.32s)]
*  But the left with their crazy climate agenda, okay, they're going to force people into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=150.28s)]
*  cars they don't want, tell them they can't eat meat, take away their gas stoves that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=155.76s)]
*  they themselves use, their refrigerators, their air conditionings and their, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=160.68s)]
*  freshers and dryers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=167.04s)]
*  This is what America needs to know about the radicalism of today's left. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=168.44s)]
*  Do you think that, do you think most Americans that maybe aren't watching this show tonight [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=173.76s)]
*  or those Americans that are not, do you think that they're going to understand this in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=179.6s)]
*  November? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=184.8s)]
*  I really do think they will, Sean. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=187.32s)]
*  I mean, look, the Democrats are waging war on basic American prosperity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=188.8s)]
*  They want us to drive cars that are made in China. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump wants us to drive cars that are made in America, because that's good for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=195.64s)]
*  our workers and that's good for the people driving the cars, too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  And I've got to say, Sean, this entire episode, I think, has taught us something about weak-willed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Republicans, because it's not just the Democrats who have attacked Donald Trump for telling [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=206.28s)]
*  the truth. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=210.68s)]
*  It's also a lot of weak-willed Republicans. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=211.68s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why you'll see I've endorsed Bernie Marino, a guy who's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=213.28s)]
*  been going across the state of Ohio, who's got a big election tomorrow, and he's been [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  saying, defending Donald Trump, not running away from this media firestorm, and that's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=221.6s)]
*  what we've got to do. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=226.8s)]
*  Send not just Donald Trump to the White House, but send good Republicans to fight for the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=228.08s)]
*  agenda that's good for the people of Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=232.68s)]
*  That's exactly what Bernie Marino is trying to do, and that's what we've got to do [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=236.2s)]
*  more of, Sean. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=239.72s)]
*  Anybody who's running away from this firestorm is a political idiot, and they've not got [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=241.32s)]
*  the best interests of the people of Ohio at heart. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=247.28s)]
*  Donald Trump told the truth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=250.12s)]
*  Let's defend him, and let's push that message forward. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiN1gfJCcs&t=251.32s)]
