# Stephen Miller: Kamala Harris will be America's first communist president if elected
**Fox News:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk)
*  Anyway, joining us now with reaction, former senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller, Fox News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=0.0s)]
*  contributor Katie Pavlich and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=5.0s)]
*  Welcome all of you to the program. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=8.8s)]
*  Katie, we start with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=11.6s)]
*  All right, can you pull offâ€”you cosponsored the New Green Deal, Medicare for All, eliminate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=12.6s)]
*  private healthcare, no fracking, no drilling, defund, dismantle, no bail laws, and free [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=16.36s)]
*  healthcare, housing and education, and decriminalizing illegal immigration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=21.94s)]
*  But never mind. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=26.44s)]
*  Does that work? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=27.44s)]
*  Look, Sean, you know, she's been accused of being a flip-flopper, and I would say she [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=28.44s)]
*  hasn't flip-flopped on anything, unless we hear directly from her why she has changed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  her policy positions on these big issues, not just a little, you know, tinkering here [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=40.28s)]
*  around the edges, 180-degree turns on mandates from the government about what kind of cars [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=45.44s)]
*  you're going to drive, a destruction of the American energy system. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=50.96s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=55.4s)]
*  Until she comes out herself and explains to everyone she's asking to vote for her, her [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=56.88s)]
*  policy positions from the 2019-2020 presidential campaign, her record as the most far-left [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=62.04s)]
*  senator even further left to Bernie Sanders in the Senate, and her record as attorney [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=67.6s)]
*  general where she took glee in ruining people's lives with the stroke of a pen, it's exactly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=71.84s)]
*  what the American people should take her at her word with. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=77.16s)]
*  And when it comes to her record, you know, now and what she's trying to run away from, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=80.48s)]
*  if her far-left record was actually popular with the American people, it's very clear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=85.3s)]
*  that her campaign is doing some polling here, and they're realizing that Trump's agenda [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=88.66s)]
*  is actually very popular among the American people, which is why they are stealing a number [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=93.58s)]
*  of his policy proposals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=99.02s)]
*  And finally, all of this is so fake. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=100.74s)]
*  I mean, the convention was fake. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=103.22s)]
*  Her policy position changes are fake through these anonymous aides. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=105.24s)]
*  And when you're being fake, you're being dishonest, and you're lying to the American people, and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=108.02s)]
*  when you're lying to them, you're disrespecting them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=112.9s)]
*  So we'll see if she can get away with it with this media propaganda machine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  But she's really taking for granted that the American people are going to buy it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=119.78s)]
*  Ari, you're the communications expert. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=124.18s)]
*  How does one pull that off? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=128.1s)]
*  My only fear, I am convinced that if the American people know her in her own words, she can't [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=129.9s)]
*  win. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=136.3s)]
*  I think her campaign knows she can't win, otherwise they wouldn't know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=137.3s)]
*  I've never seen any one candidate flip, flop and flail like this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=140.34s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=144.9s)]
*  However, ballots go out in North Carolina, what, a week, 10 days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=145.9s)]
*  Then we've got Pennsylvania, two weeks from today, early voting starts, and other states [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=150.22s)]
*  follow immediately thereafter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=155.62s)]
*  There's not a lot of time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=157.1s)]
*  And John McLaughlin two weeks ago had a poll out saying 70 to 80 percent of Americans don't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=159.02s)]
*  know these radical positions she has taken. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  Sean, there's only one way a candidate like Kamala Harris can get away with it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=168.02s)]
*  And that's if the Democratic media industrial complex helps her get away with it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  The only people who really do know her positions are people who watch conservative news. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=176.58s)]
*  Even the people who are moderate in the middle, they're not getting the real dose of who she [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=181.18s)]
*  is because it's being withheld from her, just like they withheld everything about the Hunter [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=185.02s)]
*  Biden laptop. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=189.38s)]
*  Over the whole four years have gone by, they withheld information about Joe Biden, and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=190.38s)]
*  now they're doing it to protect Kamala Harris. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  And so it's incumbent on Donald Trump personally and the Trump campaign to bring these issues [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=197.3s)]
*  to the voters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=203.18s)]
*  It's up to Dana Bash in her interview that she has on Thursday night to bring these issues [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=204.18s)]
*  to voters. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  I've never in my life seen a candidate run for office who says, I don't want to talk [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  to anybody in the media. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't, I can win without them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=215.78s)]
*  That's her strategy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=218.62s)]
*  And what the White House press corps and the national press corps have to realize is whatever [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  pattern she sets now will be the same pattern she sets if she wins. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=224.06s)]
*  So their failure to hold her to account right now is going to be repeated if she gets into [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=228.3s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=232.18s)]
*  So it's up to the press to actually do what they're supposed to do and hold a light to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=233.38s)]
*  all the various positions she has changed her position on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  They're not going to do it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out from Dana on Thursday night. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  That'll be our first clue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=244.78s)]
*  But so far they haven't, so far they've just acquiesced, and she hasn't done a single interview [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=245.88s)]
*  for more than a month. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=249.96s)]
*  That's what I meant, Sean, about the Democratic media industrial complex. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=251.6s)]
*  If she wins, it's because they work together. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=255.28s)]
*  It's the deep state. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=258.56s)]
*  Look at what they, we'll get into this in a second, what they did with Big Tech, and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=260.6s)]
*  it's Big Tech also. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Let me bring in Stephen Miller. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's the point. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what I was saying. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, those are powerful institutions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Stephen? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=271.28s)]
*  She was the most liberal DA in America. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=275.04s)]
*  She was the most liberal state attorney general in America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=278.04s)]
*  Then she became the most liberal senator in America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=281.4s)]
*  For the last four years, she's been the most liberal vice president in America, and if [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=283.84s)]
*  she were to become the president, she would be our first communist president. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  Those are the stakes, Sean. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump isn't just running against her. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=295.2s)]
*  He's running against an entire corrupt system, a corrupt DOJ and corrupt special prosecutor, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=297.52s)]
*  a corrupt corporate media, a corrupt deep state, a corrupt donor class, a corrupt financial [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  All the powers who get rich at the expense of working people are trying to stop Donald [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=311.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a people's movement. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why you see Democrats like RFK, like Tulsi Gabbard joining the Trump campaign, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=318.44s)]
*  because this is a populist working class movement to say, we want our country back, we want [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  our freedom back, and we do not want to live under communist rule in America. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, the party of freedom and joy, you know, it's pretty interesting to watch this, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=336.24s)]
*  and I watch them very closely. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=341.0s)]
*  They want to take away and confiscate your guns. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=342.24s)]
*  They want you to pay for illegal immigrants, housing, healthcare, education, and take your [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=345.38s)]
*  money. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=349.8s)]
*  That's a lot of joy in that, a lot of freedom in that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=350.8s)]
*  Make you payâ€”it's the cost of democracy, Kamala said, higher prices for energy, and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=353.52s)]
*  force EVs into your driveway, whether they say it or not, and take away your private [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=359.68s)]
*  health insurance, put tampons on boys' bathrooms in school, and take away parental rights [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=364.64s)]
*  and be allowed to change, offer gender-affirming care. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=372.64s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a freedom party or a joy party to me. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=376.68s)]
*  That sounds like a BS campaign. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=382.44s)]
*  That message better resonate. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=383.68s)]
*  People betterâ€”Hannity.com. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=385.08s)]
*  The Kamala files, the Walls files. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=388.56s)]
*  Share it with everybody you know. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=391.56s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=393.56s)]
*  I'm not deputizing the entire audience because the media won't do their job. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJmBf7OIbk&t=394.56s)]
