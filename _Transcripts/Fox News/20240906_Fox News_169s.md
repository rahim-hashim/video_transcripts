# Regardless of the moderators, I think Trump has the advantage here: Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ)
*  All right, joining us now is former presidential candidate himself, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's get your take. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=6.48s)]
*  Let's assume for a minute that ABC Disney is not going to do their job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=7.48s)]
*  And there's so many unanswered questions, as I outlined. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=12.84s)]
*  Let's assume that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=16.2s)]
*  What should Donald Trump's strategy be? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=17.64s)]
*  Look, on that first assumption, Sean, we assume that heading into the CNN debate, I think [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=20.2s)]
*  the fact that ABC is in such a position to be as obviously biased as they've been may [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=25.72s)]
*  actually cause them to correct and actually run a fair debate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=31.04s)]
*  So that's what I'm rooting for. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=33.6s)]
*  Nonetheless, regardless of how the moderators handle it, I think Donald Trump has the advantage [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=35.12s)]
*  here where he has offered detailed policy proposals in a way that Kamala Harris has [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=39.12s)]
*  not. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=44.56s)]
*  And in the same way he ran against Biden as a cog in the machine, that's what Kamala Harris [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=45.56s)]
*  is as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=50.04s)]
*  She's not quite an ideologue. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=51.32s)]
*  She's just another cog in a broader system. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=53.12s)]
*  And we're running against that system. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  One thing I want to caution against, Sean, is exactly what happened in June. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=58.48s)]
*  What I expect is that Donald Trump will once again run circles around Kamala Harris just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=62.0s)]
*  as he did with Joe Biden in that last debate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=66.8s)]
*  The question is, is that going to be good for us in winning this election or not? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=69.72s)]
*  Because last time around, it was the catalyst for something drastic happening afterwards, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=74.28s)]
*  which is in that case, swapping out Joe Biden as the nominee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=78.32s)]
*  And I think if Kamala Harris really does tank in this debate, and I think there's a decent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=81.64s)]
*  chance that happens, I think there are strange things that could happen between now and November [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=85.12s)]
*  because the Democrats, they have been playing this as in some ways one step ahead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=90.4s)]
*  You're suggesting that we may live through another change in candidates if she didn't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=95.4s)]
*  have a good debate? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=99.72s)]
*  No, I don't think it's going to be a change in the candidates. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=100.72s)]
*  The ballots have already been printed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=104.0s)]
*  But I do think that we have a machine that we're up against that has demonstrated that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=105.64s)]
*  it is going to go to great measures to defeat Donald Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=110.12s)]
*  You trace this back over the last year and a half. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=113.84s)]
*  You've got prosecutions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=116.2s)]
*  You've got civil cases. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=117.56s)]
*  You've got extra judicial attempts to remove him from the ballot. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=118.96s)]
*  They told us Joe Biden was definitively going to be the nominee, then negotiated for the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=122.36s)]
*  earliest ever presidential debate in U.S. history because they knew there was a good [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=126.44s)]
*  chance Biden would underperform. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=130.16s)]
*  Once he did, they swapped him out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=132.28s)]
*  I think we've got to learn from those lessons, Sean, to say that they're still going to have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=134.0s)]
*  many more tricks up their sleeve. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=137.2s)]
*  So the two scenarios are either Kamala Harris overperforms. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=139.96s)]
*  I don't expect that to happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=142.96s)]
*  Or what I do expect to happen is Donald Trump to seriously defeat her in this debate as [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  he did last time around. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  But don't expect that to be the end of this election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I think there's going to be more tricks left up their sleeve. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  All right, Vivek Ramaswamy, great to see you as always. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkvIrc8Z0yQ&t=153.96s)]
