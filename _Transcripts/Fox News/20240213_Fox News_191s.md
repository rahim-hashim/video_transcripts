# Sean Hannity: Biden repeated this lie
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE)
*  And welcome to Hannity. We begin tonight with a Fox News alert. The House just voted to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=0.0s)]
*  impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his role in the Biden [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=6.28s)]
*  border disaster, the crisis he created. Two articles, in fact, were approved, one accusing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=12.86s)]
*  him of refusing to comply with federal immigration laws and another accusing him of violating [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=18.2s)]
*  public trust. This weekend, Mayorkas tried to deflect responsibility for his role in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=24.12s)]
*  the crisis, claiming, oh, the system has been broken for years and repeating the lie that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=29.52s)]
*  they need Congress to fix it. No, they don't. Take a look. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=35.88s)]
*  Do you bear responsibility for what is happening at the border, what the president himself [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=40.0s)]
*  has called a crisis? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=44.14s)]
*  It certainly is a crisis, and we don't bear responsibility for a broken system, and we're [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=45.64s)]
*  doing a tremendous amount within that broken system. But fundamentally, fundamentally, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=50.28s)]
*  is the only one who can fix it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=57.28s)]
*  No, Joe Biden would just have to unresend the ones he rescinded when he got the most [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=60.28s)]
*  secure borders in history. In other words, he rescinded all the Trump policies that work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=65.6s)]
*  Recently, Joe Biden repeated the same lie. Take a look. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=69.6s)]
*  Joe, you have the power. With a stroke of a pen, you rescinded the Trump policies that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=86.96s)]
*  were working. With a stroke of a pen, you can put them back in place. Now, if the system, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=99.6s)]
*  by the way, has been broken for so long, then we have to ask ourselves, why did Joe Biden [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=105.0s)]
*  and the entire Biden administration lie to the country, all of you, for three years? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  How many times did they tell you that the border was secure and the border was closed? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=116.04s)]
*  Here's a refresher. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=120.04s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=122.04s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. We've now gotten control. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=124.04s)]
*  Precisely that. The border is closed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=128.04s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continue to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=130.04s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=137.04s)]
*  The border. We are working to make the border more secure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  It's way down. The border's closed. The border's secure, they told us for three years. We'll have more on that in a moment. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  The polls, they have just closed in the special election to replace George Santos in New York's third congressional district. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=170.12s)]
*  We'll be following that throughout the hour. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKcoGKuEuE&t=177.12s)]
