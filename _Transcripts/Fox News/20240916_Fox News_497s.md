# Sean Hannity: You can't make this up
**Fox News:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY)
*  Donald Trump is just, frankly, fortunate to be alive again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=0.0s)]
*  Another tough weekend in my home state, in this case, in Florida, for the second time [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=5.24s)]
*  this year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=9.74s)]
*  Donald Trump was nearly assassinated. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=10.74s)]
*  It was much closer than people know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=12.38s)]
*  And coming up, we're going to hear from real estate developer and friend of mine, Steve [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=14.98s)]
*  Woodcoff, who, on Sunday morning, I had breakfast with him and another friend of ours at, well, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=19.44s)]
*  if you want to know, West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=27.16s)]
*  After breakfast, I went home. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=29.16s)]
*  They went to Trump International Golf Club for a meeting and around to golf with the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=31.0s)]
*  former president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=34.88s)]
*  I was invited to play. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=36.64s)]
*  I said no. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=38.0s)]
*  And what he told me was beyond shocking, because Steve witnessed the near assassination firsthand [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=39.8s)]
*  of the former president and presidential candidate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Thankfully, at the last minute, one Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a gun [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=48.96s)]
*  being held by the would-be assassin in a treed area, some 300-plus yards from the president, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=53.92s)]
*  where he was playing golf. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  In just a moment, Steve Woodcoff will share that story right here on TV for the first [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=61.52s)]
*  time exclusively. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=67.04s)]
*  Also, Eric Trump, a rifle marksman in his own right, he is furious, rightly so, that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=68.04s)]
*  a would-be assassin got so close to his father with a scoped AK-47. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=74.28s)]
*  We'll get his take on what is going wrong with the agency. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  Now, if not for one eagle-eyed Secret Service officer and several others who engaged the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=83.8s)]
*  shooter from an open field, Donald Trump likely would not be alive tonight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  It seems that the potential assassin here was within moments of firing that shot. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  It is clear that the agents in Trump's security detail that were next to him and around him, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  they all acted heroically. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=109.54s)]
*  They were all willing to sacrifice their own bodies in the face of imminent danger. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  What, no greater love have manned than to lay down their life for another? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  That's those guys and those men and women. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=120.42s)]
*  Now, this was yet another glaring security failure at the leadership at the DHS, the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  Secret Service, but they don't see it that way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=130.5s)]
*  Yesterday was an off-the-record movement, off the record, and the president wasn't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=131.5s)]
*  even really supposed to go there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=137.06s)]
*  It was not on his official schedule. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  And so we put together a security plan, and that security plan worked. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  Now, the acting Secret Service director went on to praise Mayor Orkis and said the DHS [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  did a great job. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=149.46s)]
*  I beg to differ tonight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=150.82s)]
*  That security plan did not work. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=152.86s)]
*  The agents around the president were phenomenal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=155.22s)]
*  There is, there are two groups of people we're talking about here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  You have a deranged Democrat, his name is Ryan Ruth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=162.18s)]
*  He got within 300-plus yards of Donald Trump with an AK-47-style rifle equipped with a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=166.06s)]
*  long-range scope, and Ruth was able to create a sniper's nest besides the, what, 56th [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=172.62s)]
*  hole of Trump International golf course hidden in the bushes, where he posted up, apparently, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=179.06s)]
*  for nearly 12 hours, according to phone records. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=184.62s)]
*  Take a look at this map. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=188.1s)]
*  Look at the close—look at that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=189.9s)]
*  Look at that proximity of—that is Congress Street, right there on the outside of where [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=191.9s)]
*  the golf course is, and the wooded area, and the fifth hole green, and right where Donald [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=197.42s)]
*  Trump was getting ready to putt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=204.5s)]
*  Those trees are well-known areas to the Secret Service and everybody. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=206.54s)]
*  That is the area where paparazzi often will hide to get pictures of President Trump golfing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=212.22s)]
*  and not be noticed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=219.32s)]
*  There were no Secret Service agents at all that were watching Congress Avenue. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=221.1s)]
*  Nobody checked the wooded area, not one person. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=227.1s)]
*  A would-be assassin got that close to President Trump with the AK-47 and the scope, where [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  the former president was well within close shooting range. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=238.66s)]
*  Thankfully, the last minute, a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of Ruth's gun, and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=242.1s)]
*  Secret Service agents fired on his location. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=248.66s)]
*  Ruth, unfortunately, was able to get away. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=252.34s)]
*  Thankfully, luckily, a witness saw him entering his vehicle, snapped a picture of his license [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=255.46s)]
*  plate, and that is what ultimately led to his arrest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=261.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=264.5s)]
*  Take two steps to your right! [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=265.7s)]
*  Driver! [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=269.86s)]
*  Walk straight back! [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=270.74s)]
*  Keep walking! [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=272.34s)]
*  I keep out long. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=274.02s)]
*  We need long-gaps. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=278.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is alive today because of luck and several brave, fast-acting Secret Service [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=280.02s)]
*  agents. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=295.7s)]
*  As it relates to the planning and the execution of Trump's security, that part of their mission, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=297.18s)]
*  well, I could say tonight with certainty, was an abject failure. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  Now, also today, coincidentally, Senator Josh Hawley, Missouri, released a Senate whistleblower [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=307.58s)]
*  report on the failures of the Secret Service from the first assassination attempt. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=313.94s)]
*  That was the one back in July in Butler, PA. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=319.3s)]
*  Now, according to one whistleblower, the DHS treated the Butler rally as, quote, a loose [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  security event, did not deploy detection canines, also did not station DHS personnel at, quote, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=328.26s)]
*  regular interviews, intervals at the security perimeter, and that's not all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  The report also alleges that security personnel abandoned the roof directly across from the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=342.22s)]
*  president. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=348.02s)]
*  That is where Matthew Crooks ultimately took aim, because they told us the weather was [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=349.26s)]
*  too hot. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=354.38s)]
*  Too hot? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=355.74s)]
*  When I was in construction, and I fell off a roof nearly three stories, well, I was on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=356.74s)]
*  roofs that really were steep and at a slope, and that was never a consideration, not working [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=362.62s)]
*  on a hot day. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=370.02s)]
*  Last week, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Americans will be shocked when we learn [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=371.74s)]
*  full extent of the Secret Service failures that happened at Butler, at the rally there, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=376.94s)]
*  and yet the Secret Service came dangerously close to letting it happen again. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=383.42s)]
*  What happened on Sunday was a colossal security failure. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  You could not have, in Butler, PA, Pennsylvania, an assassin or would-be assassin 130 yards [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=392.38s)]
*  from the president or presidential candidate. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=399.68s)]
*  You cannot have them 300 yards away in a wooded area off a golf course when the president [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=403.12s)]
*  is playing golf. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=409.12s)]
*  Now, Ryan Wesley Ruth was a deranged lunatic who called Trump a threat to democracy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=410.12s)]
*  Where have I heard that before? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=416.52s)]
*  On social media, echoing the mantra of the Democratic radical left in this country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=419.24s)]
*  His truck has a Biden-Harris sticker on the back. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=425.02s)]
*  He's donated to Democratic causes nearly 20 times. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=427.88s)]
*  He also seemed to have an agenda as it relates to Ukraine, trying to recruit former vets [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=432.16s)]
*  that fought in Afghanistan for that war effort. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=437.24s)]
*  Now, I'll be clear. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, I don't blame them for Ruth's actions, just like Bernie Sanders [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  was not to blame for the congressional baseball shooting carried out by one of his devout [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=447.24s)]
*  supporters. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  But if the roles are reversed here, you better believe Democrats, the media mob, all those [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  in big tech, they would be blaming Donald Trump, any conservative and every Republican. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=460.18s)]
*  And one can ask why more Secret Service personnel are not being assigned to protect the number [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  one political target in the country. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=471.8s)]
*  In fact, some very sick people on the left, they've taken it in the other direction. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to blame Donald Trump for almost getting assassinated. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=479.98s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  And if you're not going to watch and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=490.16s)]
*  analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvxCKDeNOY&t=492.94s)]
