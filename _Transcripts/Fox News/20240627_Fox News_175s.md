# Hannity: This is a consequential election
**Fox News:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM)
*  Harold, have you ever been confused for Jesse? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=0.0s)]
*  Just tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=2.0s)]
*  Maybe some other people that look like me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=4.0s)]
*  All right, all right. Listen, let's go back down to the spin room. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=6.0s)]
*  Sean Hannity is there. Sean, you know, we were talking a lot before in the days leading up to this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=9.0s)]
*  about the tone and tenor that the former president is going to take [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=13.0s)]
*  and what he's bringing to the table. You know him better than most. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=17.0s)]
*  What do you think he's coming with in 39 minutes? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, I can tell you I know a lot of people that have been around him have been very, very clear [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=26.0s)]
*  that he really has to be measured. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=31.0s)]
*  If I were to talk about what I think we're going to expect tonight, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=36.0s)]
*  tone, pitch, cadence, humor, intelligence, and a real focus on the future from him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=40.0s)]
*  Look, he knows that Joe is going to try and bait him, call him an insurrectionist. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=47.0s)]
*  He's going to say democracy is in peril. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=52.0s)]
*  January 6th, convicted felon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=54.0s)]
*  All of that, you know, they've all anticipated that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=57.0s)]
*  All the people around him that I've spoken to. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=60.0s)]
*  But I think all of that is going to lead to Donald Trump, you know, having a few lines of his own. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=63.0s)]
*  And there are a lot of vulnerabilities that we expect. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=68.0s)]
*  One thing, Britt brought up the question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=70.0s)]
*  How odd is it that you have a president of the United States leaves his day job for over a full week [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=73.0s)]
*  to prepare for what is really a 90 minute debate about the very issues that he should be dialed into every day? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=81.0s)]
*  That seems beyond excessive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=89.0s)]
*  Now, we I brought up the issue right after the State of the Union. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=91.0s)]
*  I felt that Joe, he wouldn't even allow the Speaker of the House time to introduce him as is custom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=95.0s)]
*  And he just went out there and he was screaming and hyped up and hyper caffeinated, I call him, or jacked up Joe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=101.0s)]
*  The question I think a lot of people have is, you know, which Joe Biden is going to show up tonight? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=108.0s)]
*  Because we had never seen that Joe Biden before the State of the Union. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=112.0s)]
*  And we really haven't seen him since that way since the State of the Union. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=116.0s)]
*  Now, if he shows up and he's that aggressive and if he shows up and he's that more cognitively aware, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=120.0s)]
*  I think that might also bring a lot of questions about his his mental cognitive condition. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=126.0s)]
*  And I think it's a real issue in the campaign on top of the issues that I mentioned earlier, immigration, the economy, inflation, law and order are, you know, what's happening in the world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=134.0s)]
*  There are so many things that are that are very impactful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=144.0s)]
*  These are consequential times. This is a consequential election. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=148.0s)]
*  I would argue it's an inflection point. And if it's not either of those two, I'm thinking Jesse Waters is going to have to step in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=152.0s)]
*  If asked, I will serve. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrfJc51SFM&t=159.0s)]
