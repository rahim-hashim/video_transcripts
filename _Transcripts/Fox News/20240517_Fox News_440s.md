# Mark Levin: Part of this is 'performance art'
**Fox News:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4)
*  All right, it was an absolutely brutal day for Michael Cohen during cross-examination. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, he is the host of Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=5.2s)]
*  I call him the Great One, Marc Levin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=8.32s)]
*  Marc, we had a conversation last night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=10.16s)]
*  I asked you, what would your closing arguments be? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  And I asked you to tell this audience what your closing arguments would be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=16.16s)]
*  Well, you don't want to hear my closing argument because I'd be held in contempt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=21.36s)]
*  But instead, what I'd like to do, if that's all right, Sean, is give you my opening argument [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=28.12s)]
*  on why Alvin Bragg should be disbarred, why he should be facing charges for suborning [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=32.36s)]
*  perjury, which I've talked about on my radio show for the last three days, and also why [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=39.68s)]
*  he's in violation of the Brady Act. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=44.32s)]
*  We have very smart lawyers, some fairly smart lawyers, who are talking about this case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=47.2s)]
*  They're all saying the same thing in a different way because the case is so outrageous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=53.64s)]
*  We're running out of words and explanations for it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=56.8s)]
*  None of us have ever seen anything like this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=59.56s)]
*  You have collateral evidence, which is unconstitutional. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=61.48s)]
*  You have somebody being charged, and he's not sure what he's charged with, which is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=65.12s)]
*  unconstitutional. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=68.44s)]
*  You have all kinds of allegations being made, which are absolutely outrageous and not relevant. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=70.32s)]
*  You have a dead state statute that remains dead today that's being used. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=77.84s)]
*  You have a federal campaign law, and nobody knows exactly what part of the federal campaign [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=82.52s)]
*  law we're talking about. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  And so I want to talk about Alvin Bragg rather than keep talking about the same thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=90.0s)]
*  There's a Supreme Court case called Brady v. Maryland. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=94.92s)]
*  The Supreme Court rule—and I'll keep it tight—that the government, the prosecutor, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  must not withhold exculpatory evidence, must be given to the defense. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, if they know that evidence is false or might be false, they're not supposed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=112.16s)]
*  to use it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=116.48s)]
*  That doesn't mean you don't have impeachment and these other things taking place. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=117.76s)]
*  If a prosecutor affirmably knows that there is materially false information that this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=120.76s)]
*  witness may give, or any lawyer for that, they are not to present that person. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=125.86s)]
*  Now, exculpatory evidence, the Supreme Court says. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=131.24s)]
*  Well, we have exculpatory evidence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=134.72s)]
*  Robert has been here, Costello, on all these shows. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=137.32s)]
*  Look, he's not Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=140.92s)]
*  This guy is the former deputy chief of the criminal division of the Southern District [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=143.04s)]
*  of New York. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=146.78s)]
*  Does it get any higher than that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=147.78s)]
*  And he was Cohen's lawyer for a critical period of time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=149.64s)]
*  And he's been on my show, Saturday. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=153.56s)]
*  He's been on other shows. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=155.96s)]
*  He was on a show this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=157.28s)]
*  He testified before Congress under oath. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=158.62s)]
*  And he said, look, this guy is a liar. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=161.28s)]
*  I was his lawyer. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=163.84s)]
*  I have 300 emails. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=164.84s)]
*  I have contemporaneous information. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=166.84s)]
*  I'm telling you, he's a liar, on top of all the other lies the guy is told. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  And nobody wants this guy as a witness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=174.56s)]
*  That's why the U.S. Attorney's Office didn't want him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=176.6s)]
*  That's why Vance didn't want him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  That's why Bragg initially didn't want him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=180.6s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=182.14s)]
*  What happened is Mr. Bragg. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=184.04s)]
*  Mr. Bragg should be disbarred. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=186.16s)]
*  Mr. Bragg has violated the Brady Rule. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=188.28s)]
*  That's a half a century old rule. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  The emails, he has access to the emails. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=193.92s)]
*  Mr. Costello said he only showed six to the grand jury, but he had access to all of them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=196.84s)]
*  Mr. Costello gave—that's contemporary communication between the lawyer and his client, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=201.16s)]
*  for which Mr. Costello got a waiver. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=206.52s)]
*  This is a very, very big case, a very, very big matter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  So when that government witness is on the stand, that means the district attorney and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  the government are vouching for the truth, the integrity, for the testimony of that witness. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=217.24s)]
*  And that witness was put up there despite the fact that the government knew from these [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=223.72s)]
*  emails of Mr. Costello's testimony that he's a liar. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=228.8s)]
*  And even if it wasn't a Brady violation, you don't have your main witness as somebody [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=233.72s)]
*  who is a complete reprobate, and he doesn't go to prison for a thousand different reasons. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=239.28s)]
*  He goes to prison because he's a liar. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=243.84s)]
*  Now, suborning perjury. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=246.08s)]
*  I've been talking about this on radio, and Judge DeNing brought it up earlier, touched [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  on it, and U.S. Attorney Tolman brought it up a little bit. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=252.48s)]
*  I want to expand on this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=256.16s)]
*  We lawyers, we need to police what's going on here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=258.0s)]
*  We can't just wring our hands since it's terrible. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=260.88s)]
*  It is terrible. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=263.16s)]
*  And these people need to be held to account. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=264.52s)]
*  Bragg put Cohen on the stand after obviously they worked with him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=266.72s)]
*  They knew what he was going to say. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=270.64s)]
*  Any prosecutor does that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=272.48s)]
*  They let them know what kind of questions they're going to ask. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=273.96s)]
*  In other words, part of this is performance art. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=276.12s)]
*  Bragg knew that there were material matters that implicated Cohen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=279.32s)]
*  He was aware of it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=283.88s)]
*  Information, contemporary emails, Mr. Costello's testimony, among others, that's directly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  contradicted what his own attorney said and what others have said. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=291.78s)]
*  And he still put him on that stand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=297.11999999999995s)]
*  And this is material information. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  This is their key witness. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=301.64s)]
*  Look at the texts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=303.14s)]
*  We still don't know about the texts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's an important issue, too. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=307.32s)]
*  Did this government not have his texts? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=309.52s)]
*  If they had the text, did they give it to the defense? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=311.96s)]
*  How did the defense get the texts? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=313.96s)]
*  And this isn't the first time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=316.02s)]
*  Remember when 30,000 pages of documents just showed up from the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  two or three weeks before the case started and the judge said, that's fine, that's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  enough time to prepare? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  Or not giving a heads up to the defense when witnesses are going to be called, maybe they'll [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=328.0s)]
*  get a five hour? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=332.52s)]
*  That's a due process violation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=333.52s)]
*  What we have in Mr. Bragg is a lawless government official. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=335.56s)]
*  And I contend that he's violated the Brady ruling of the Supreme Court. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=341.42s)]
*  I contend that he and his staff have been subordaining perjury. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=345.8s)]
*  One other thing before my time is up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=351.26s)]
*  Brad Smith, the former FEC chairman. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=353.52s)]
*  Brad Smith has been on my show twice and he said what he would say. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=357.24s)]
*  He said he might be called as an expert witness by the Trump lawyers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=360.12s)]
*  He said this is bogus. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=363.48s)]
*  He's an expert on the federal campaign law. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=365.28s)]
*  He said there's no way a nondisclosure agreement in any way is an illegal campaign contribution [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  and he'll go through it soup to nuts. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=373.11999999999995s)]
*  That's why the judge doesn't want him to testify. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  That is a torpedo into the side of the good ship Bragg here that will take it down, that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=377.76s)]
*  the jury will understand. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=383.32s)]
*  When an expert, not Stormy Daniels, not all these people off the street that they're bringing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w30RBYI8U4&t=384.91999999999996s)]
