# Jim Jordan launches investigation into Special Counsel Jack Smith
**Fox News:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to)
*  Also breaking tonight, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio has announced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=0.0s)]
*  an investigation into the special counsel, Jack Smith, after a shocking filing from his [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=6.12s)]
*  office on Friday revealed that documents seized from Mar-a-Lago are no longer in the same [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=11.96s)]
*  order or sequence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=18.32s)]
*  The filing included a footnote reading, quote, the government acknowledges that this is inconsistent [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=20.04s)]
*  with what the government counsel previously understood and represented to the court. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=26.74s)]
*  Here with more, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=32.3s)]
*  What would you call this, Jim Jordan? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=36.3s)]
*  I'm wondering if the issue of whether or not the evidence has been tainted is now front [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=38.42s)]
*  and center in the case in Florida. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=42.46s)]
*  Yeah, the order of the documents seized was changed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=44.58s)]
*  That one sentence says it all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  Most people would call that tampering with evidence. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=50.94s)]
*  The physical documents didn't match up with the scanned documents. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=53.52s)]
*  And here's the irony, Sean. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=57.2s)]
*  This is Jack Smith mishandling the very documents that he's charging President Trump with mishandling. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=66.68s)]
*  I mean, that to me is the ultimate irony here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=67.68s)]
*  Not to mention, of course, the double standard. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=70.28s)]
*  We had Robert Herr six weeks ago in front of our committee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=73.2s)]
*  Robert Herr said Joe Biden met the elements of the crime. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  He knowingly kept, knowingly disclosed classified information. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  But he wasn't charged because he says he was a forgetful old man. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=83.02s)]
*  And we also established motive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=87.46s)]
*  Robert Herr said on page 231 of his report, Joe Biden had strong motivations for ignoring [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  classified procedures because he was writing a book, a book for which he got paid eight [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=94.94s)]
*  million dollars. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  So he had an eight million dollar motive. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=102.46s)]
*  He met the elements, but he doesn't get charged. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=104.28s)]
*  President Trump does. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=107.44s)]
*  And then Jack Smith mishandles the very documents. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  You can't make this stuff up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  You really can't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=114.86000000000001s)]
*  Let me get your reaction to what's going on in the court. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  You have the judge threatening to put President Trump in jail. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  You have clearly a judge in this case, according to my reading of the law, that should have [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  recused himself. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  You have allegations, serious ones, of the family being involved in compromise and possibly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=127.56s)]
*  benefiting from the outcome of this trial. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=132.8s)]
*  Then you have the third highest ranking official at the Department of Justice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  This is Merrick Garland's Department of Justice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=140.74s)]
*  Number three, pretty prestigious position. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  A guy that we now know was raising money, political donations with the DNC. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  And this guy is now, leaves us that big important job to go work and run this case for Alvin [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  Bragg in New York City. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=158.62s)]
*  Tell me how that's not a conflict of interest. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=161.38s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  You got a partisan Democrat prosecuting the case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=165.38s)]
*  You got a partisan judge overseeing the case. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=169.06s)]
*  The partisan judge's daughter worked for Adam Schiff. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=171.74s)]
*  She's obviously partisan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=174.34s)]
*  And then of course, there's a gag order on the former president of the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=175.76s)]
*  The guy I believe is going to be the next president of the United States. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=179.72s)]
*  There's a gag order on him, but Michael Cohen, the convicted perjurer, the guy who lied six [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=182.86s)]
*  times in front of Congress when he came and testified, he's allowed to say whatever he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=187.62s)]
*  wants. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=191.58s)]
*  He's allowed to go on TikTok and social media and spout off whatever he wants. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=192.58s)]
*  And that's their star witness. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=195.84s)]
*  The country is laughing at this case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=197.38s)]
*  And it's why President Trump's numbers, I think in the latest Rasmussen poll, he's up [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=199.4s)]
*  like 10% in the national poll. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=203.22s)]
*  That's because the country sees through it all. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=205.94s)]
*  They see through what Jack Smith is doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=207.62s)]
*  They see through what Alvin Bragg is doing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=209.54s)]
*  And they've a long time ago seen through what Fonny Willis is doing in Georgia. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the real conspiracy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=215.78s)]
*  Jack Smith, Alvin Bragg, Fonny Willis looking to conspire to impact the 2024 presidential [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=224.26s)]
*  Let me ask you, do you believe, how long will it take your committee to get answers on this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=225.66s)]
*  new part of your investigation, which is the weaponization of the DOJ under Joe Biden and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  now the special counsel? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=237.22s)]
*  And by the way, is the special counsel even constitutionally allowed to have that job? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=239.0s)]
*  Clarence Thomas brought that up in oral arguments. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=248.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's debate about that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=249.98s)]
*  But we went to, we went directly, we're demanding the Office of Professional Responsibility [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=250.98s)]
*  to give us answers, not only about Jack Smith and this discrepancy in the physical documents [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=254.38s)]
*  and the scan documents, those not matching up, but also the guy who works for him, this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=258.62s)]
*  Jay Bratt, who pressured one of the other defendants in this case, pressured Mr. Nauta's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=262.42s)]
*  attorney about, oh, we thought you were interested in a judge position while they're meeting [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=267.1s)]
*  to talk about the classified documents case. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=271.62s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=274.42s)]
*  So we want to know answers to that question as well. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=275.78s)]
*  This Jay Bratt, who works for Jack Smith's team. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=278.06s)]
*  Yeah, pretty unbelievable. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=281.74s)]
*  Anyway, Jim Jordan, we really appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to be with us tonight. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQZml32z7to&t=286.58000000000004s)]
