# Tom Homan: I'll meet with anyone to talk about public safety
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0)
*  Here with reaction, Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=0.0s)]
*  Not exactly the guy that I would think that you'd have an alliance with. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=3.44s)]
*  How did it go today? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=7.2s)]
*  It went great. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=8.2s)]
*  Look, I sat down with the mayor for well over an hour. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  He gets it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=13.66s)]
*  And today he proved that, as the mayor in New York City, he's more concerned with public [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=14.66s)]
*  safety than politics. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=18.66s)]
*  I wish the mayor of Chicago and San Diego City Council and Governor Pritzker, I wish [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=20.32s)]
*  a page out of the mayor Eric Adams playbook because the ex-cop came out of him today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=27.04s)]
*  He really cares about public safety. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=34.9s)]
*  He's putting politics aside. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=36.6s)]
*  He wants to help ICE take criminal threats off the street. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=38.36s)]
*  He wants to help ICE look for national security threats. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=41.24s)]
*  He wants to help ICE find over 340,000 missing children, which many of them are going to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  be in the city. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=48.44s)]
*  So a great meeting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=49.44s)]
*  And hats off to the mayor for coming to the table and working with us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=50.5s)]
*  Do you have any other meetings planned with any other Democrats at this time? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=55.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=59.28s)]
*  But I'll tell you this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=60.76s)]
*  Ever since it's been announced that I met with Mayor Adams, several other mayorsâ€”and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=61.88s)]
*  I can't speak out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=65.64s)]
*  I don't want to give it up right now because I haven't called them back, but I've been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=66.64s)]
*  in contact with a couple other mayors. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=69.6s)]
*  Even Governor Pritzker, I saw on the paper today, he's willing to sit down. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=71.84s)]
*  So I think what Mayor Adams did today is not only good for New York City, I think it's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=75.44s)]
*  going to be a domino effect. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=80.2s)]
*  I'm hoping that some of the mayors come forward after seeing the success we had today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=82.36s)]
*  Anybody by the name of Gavin Newsom ever contact you? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=87.16s)]
*  Gavin Newsom will never contact me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=90.84s)]
*  Okay, would you meet with him? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=93.12s)]
*  I'd meet with anybody to talk about taking public safety threats off the street. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=95.6s)]
*  And that's what irritates me, Sean. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=99.48s)]
*  You've got these elected politicians who say they're going to put roadblocks up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=100.48s)]
*  And President Trump's been clear. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=104.84s)]
*  We're talking about out of the gate, priority public safety threats. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  No elected official, Republican, Democrat, Independent should be pushing back on removing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=109.92s)]
*  public safety threats from their communities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=113.48s)]
*  That is their number one responsibility as a mayor and a governor. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=115.62s)]
*  But I don't expect to hear from Newsom, but if he was to call, I would absolutely meet [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=118.52s)]
*  with him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=121.8s)]
*  You know, here's what's interesting about Mayor Adams. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=122.8s)]
*  I think, and I've got to give a lot of credit to Governors Abbott and DeSantis because both [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=125.52s)]
*  of them, you know, they said fine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=130.52s)]
*  Mayor Adams initially said, you're welcome in New York. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=133.32s)]
*  It was a sanctuary city, New York City. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=137.12s)]
*  And then guess what? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=140.76s)]
*  They started sending illegal immigrants from Texas and Florida to New York. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=141.76s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the reality of his policies, he came face to face with. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  He sees the high cost. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=152.7s)]
*  He saw the increase of crime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=154.02s)]
*  He saw the increase of overdoses and all of this, you know, associated with these unvetted [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=156.2s)]
*  illegals. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=161.12s)]
*  I feel his conversion is real based on reality. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=166.6s)]
*  Am I perception? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=167.6s)]
*  No, you're exactly right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  What Abbott and DeSantis is, we're game changers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  But you know what no one ever talks about? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=174.6s)]
*  And who was ideal that was originally? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  President Trump, because when I was the ice director and President Trump, when the numbers [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=178.04s)]
*  were climbing, he was thinking about doing the same thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=180.94s)]
*  However, because his out of the box thinking is unprecedented success on the border, by [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=183.84s)]
*  the time we got that plan getting ready to be implemented, we couldn't fill a bus up [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=190.2s)]
*  because we ended the catch-and-release. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=193.88s)]
*  We had to remain in Mexico. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=194.88s)]
*  So you gotta give President Trump a little bit of credit because that was originally [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=196.28s)]
*  his idea. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=198.76s)]
*  Did you at all talk about the legal issues he's now facing and the fact that I think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=200.48s)]
*  he believes it's related to his outspokenness on and criticism of Harris and Biden and their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  immigration policy? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Did you talk about that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=213.6s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=214.6s)]
*  What we did talk about, he wanted to understand how ICE does their job. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=215.6s)]
*  He wanted to understand what roadblocks we had in New York City. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=219.9s)]
*  He has told me that he's going to look at executive orders to undo some of the damage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=224.24s)]
*  done by de Blasio. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=226.88s)]
*  He would like to see us back in Rutgers Island to arrest the bad guy in the safety and security [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=228.66s)]
*  of the jail rather than release them into the community and put the community at risk [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=232.38s)]
*  and my officers at risk, the rest of somebody in the community rather than the jail. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=235.52s)]
*  He wants his law enforcement officers in the precincts to release criminal amulets to us [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=239.5s)]
*  and not on the street. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=244.34s)]
*  And we talked about, you know, Lake and Riley. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  That Lake and Riley's killer was arrested here in New York City for endangering a child. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=248.08s)]
*  If things were different, we could have, ICE could have took custody of him rather than [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=251.74s)]
*  releasing him and him going to Georgia to commit that horrendous murder. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=254.52s)]
*  So he asked a lot of great questions and we left that, I left that meeting feeling really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=257.82s)]
*  good and we're going to continue our conversations. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=262.36s)]
*  Our staffs are going to get together and work out the details, but I think New York City [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=264.74s)]
*  is about to get a lot safer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=268.7s)]
*  I think New York City is about to send a strong message to the rest of the world that we're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=269.94s)]
*  taking the right steps to take public safety threats, especially adults who are not supposed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=274.14s)]
*  to be in this country to begin with, and we're moving to the city. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=277.66s)]
*  We're going to make New York safer. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=280.5s)]
*  So we have known terrorists, we have cartel members, we have gang members, we have violent [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=282.5s)]
*  criminals in the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  We know they're here, we know there are a lot of them, but we don't know where they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  are. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  We have, you know, people that have committed murders and rape. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, how do you find them? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=295.7s)]
*  How do you possibly find all of those people? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=298.05999999999995s)]
*  Well, we're not going to find all of them, and that's just a stone cold fact, but we [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  have ways of finding people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  I can't really discuss it because it's law enforcement sensitive, our processes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  However, the mayor also agreed, look, he's got a lot of uniforms in this city that know [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=310.5s)]
*  what's going on in their neighborhoods. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=315.86s)]
*  New York NYPD has one of the best intelligence apparatuses in the entire world that he's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=317.62s)]
*  going to help us with. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=323.98s)]
*  So we're going to count on every uniform in this city to give us information on where [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=325.18s)]
*  those criminals are at, and also, as President Trump has committed, we're going to deputize [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=329.82000000000005s)]
*  every U.S. citizen in this country to help us find 340,000 missing children because we [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=334.14s)]
*  need the public's help on this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=340.06s)]
*  Every mom and dad knows what it's like. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=341.5s)]
*  They have a gut feeling when they see something out there in the public that something ain't [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=343.7s)]
*  right with that child, so we're going to deputize every one of them to help us find these children. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  All right, we appreciate your time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=350.74s)]
*  Incoming board is our Tom Holman. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=352.9s)]
*  Thank you, and Godspeed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=354.62s)]
*  This is an important job. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=355.62s)]
*  compelling analysis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=364.14s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8volvj09w0&t=365.78s)]
