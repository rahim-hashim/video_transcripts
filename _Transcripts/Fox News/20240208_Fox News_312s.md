# Trump attorney's fiery response to Biden classified docs report: 'MIND-BOGGLING'
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE)
*  And earlier today, former President Trump, he called on the special counsel in his cases [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=0.0s)]
*  to immediately drop all charges against him, especially in the classified documents case, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=5.28s)]
*  following news that Biden will not be charged. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=10.96s)]
*  And President Trump called Biden's case, quote, 100 times more severe, and called out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=13.58s)]
*  the two standards of justice in our country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=18.72s)]
*  Here now with reaction is Trump legal spokesperson Alina Haba. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=21.32s)]
*  Legally speaking, the question I was just asking Greg Jarrett—and, by the way, thank [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=25.92s)]
*  you for joining us, Alina—the question I was asking him, now that this is their standard, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=29.32s)]
*  that you can willfully retain and handle classified documents and not be punished for it, does [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=35.96s)]
*  that open up a legal window for you and your legal team to go in and say, you know, we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  need equal application of our laws here? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=48.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=51.2s)]
*  I think the one thing that we learned today from special counsel Herr is that there is, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=53.2s)]
*  not that we didn't know it, Sean, two systems of justice, one if you're a Republican, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=57.52s)]
*  one if you're a Democrat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  We've seen it time and time again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  You've spoken of it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=64.0s)]
*  The way that this can be used and what has become obvious that they haven't really [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=65.2s)]
*  thought about is they try and look impartial. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=69.56s)]
*  They try and say, OK, we're going to raid Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Ooh, maybe that was a little too much. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=73.72s)]
*  Let's peel it back. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  Let's look at Biden's documents. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=77.04s)]
*  One thing they're forgetting that is so clear to me as an attorney is that, number [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has one thing that Biden as Senator Biden, as Vice President Biden, didn't [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=84.56s)]
*  have. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=89.4s)]
*  The Presidential Records Act, something that has shielded President Clinton. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=90.4s)]
*  So when you're looking at this dual system of justice, they're going to have to face [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=94.24s)]
*  the music when we're in court. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=97.84s)]
*  They're going to have to answer questions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=99.2s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=101.24s)]
*  We shouldn't even be going to court. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=102.24s)]
*  Honestly, I agree with my client 100 percent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=103.24s)]
*  They need to drop charges and let Americans believe that we're not going to be treated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=105.52s)]
*  differently depending on our politics. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=109.08s)]
*  I don't think they're capable of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=110.92s)]
*  I think they have severe Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=112.24s)]
*  But you know, it's very obvious what's happening here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=115.0s)]
*  But I do want to thank Special Counsel Herr for making it very clear to the American public [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=117.6s)]
*  that this man can't even remember when his son was passed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  And more importantly, Sean, did you see what he said today in the press conference? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=125.52s)]
*  He doubled down on it and said, I didn't think I needed to answer that question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=129.28s)]
*  Well, that's another problem that we haven't spoken about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=133.04s)]
*  You're sitting in an investigation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=135.92s)]
*  You have an obligation to answer truthfully and honestly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=136.92s)]
*  Today was just mind boggling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=141.2s)]
*  They absolutely should drop the charges. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  We shouldn't even have to go as far as to defend it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=144.54s)]
*  And then he went for it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=147.76s)]
*  Then right there, he had a memory lapse. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=148.76s)]
*  I wear this every day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=151.2s)]
*  My son's rosary from Our Lady of No Answer. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=153.0s)]
*  He didn't finish it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Then he said, you know, General Al Sisi of Egypt was from Mexico on top of what else [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  has happened this week. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=165.12s)]
*  He couldn't remember the name Hamas, Francois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl of Germany when it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=166.16s)]
*  was Angela Merkel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=172.64s)]
*  I just don't know how many of these moments he can keep having when people stay in denial. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=174.96s)]
*  And for the record, Alina, I faced a lot of criticism when I was probably one of the first [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=179.68s)]
*  people out there to point this out on a regular basis. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=186.32s)]
*  And you know, how did I get paid back in return? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=190.84s)]
*  They tried to compare me to Joe. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=193.28s)]
*  Well, even Sean Hannity once got the mixed up the names of Matt Gaetz and Jason Chaffetz. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=194.8s)]
*  No, I don't have this problem. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=199.12s)]
*  And that's the problem also. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=201.64s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=203.0s)]
*  I don't have the nuclear football next to me at all times in my day and night. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=205.0s)]
*  I don't have that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=210.36s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=211.36s)]
*  Sean, I would feel better if you did, frankly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=212.36s)]
*  What is the country going to take out of this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=213.36s)]
*  We probably would be in better shape. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=216.36s)]
*  Well, I think the country has to see it for what it is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=217.36s)]
*  Yeah, we would. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=219.36s)]
*  Listen, they hit you, they hit me, they hit anybody that stands with what's right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=220.36s)]
*  And the Constitution stands with the moral compass and the boundaries that we used to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=224.76s)]
*  have as an America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't have them anymore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  They fear what they are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=232.32s)]
*  They know that President Trump is the right person. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=234.44s)]
*  They know that we have a candidate that's fighting him that can't even spell Bob backwards. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And we're sitting here trying to deal with and reconcile how we're safe as a country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=241.88s)]
*  Well, we're not, which is why they're making fun of us all around the world, which is why [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=246.11999999999998s)]
*  we're seeing what's happening with our borders and its complete election interference. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  It's completely because they have to lie, cheat and steal in order to win in November. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  If we don't stop as a country, if we don't wake up and say, this is a man who just frankly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=258.68s)]
*  can't do it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=262.56s)]
*  And by the way, if he can't do it, who are we stuck with? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=263.56s)]
*  Kamala? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=266.12s)]
*  Oh boy, we are in trouble. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=267.12s)]
*  So as a country, like Alan said, and I love Alan Dershowitz because he is a Democrat, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=268.96s)]
*  but he sees it for what it is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=274.24s)]
*  We are in trouble. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=275.76s)]
*  We got to get behind Trump right now if we want our country back. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=276.76s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=278.96s)]
*  Well, I certainly this election is going to take on a whole new significance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=279.96s)]
*  I think starting tomorrow and we'll see what happens. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=284.0s)]
*  I think we all know that if Donald Trump had these moments, the media coverage would be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  far different. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=291.88s)]
*  And that's just the double standard that we have. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=292.88s)]
*  Alina Haba, great to have you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=296.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPb5F9FzHE&t=299.71999999999997s)]
