# Hannity: This is a clear matter of national security
**Fox News:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w)
*  First tonight, Biden's border crisis. It is causing chaos across the entire country, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=0.0s)]
*  in the heart of New York City's Times Square, where a mob of illegal immigrants were caught [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=6.0s)]
*  in a very disturbing video. Look at this. Saturday night, beating up New York City police [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=11.08s)]
*  officers. You can see it right there. Four suspects. They were arrested. They were charged [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=17.2s)]
*  with assault. But according to sources, they were reportedly released back and onto the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=23.48s)]
*  streets without bail. Of course, New York City, you've got New York State's no bail laws. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=28.2s)]
*  You know, think about this for a second. No bail for a mob of people beating up cops. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=32.72s)]
*  Also tonight, The New York Post is reporting that illegal immigrants are now forming pickpocketing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=40.2s)]
*  crews in the Big Apple, causing new headaches for an already strained NYPD. They have more [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=45.08s)]
*  people leaving than they've ever had in history. As we have been reporting on the show, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=50.84s)]
*  illegal immigrant crisis, it is no longer impacting just states along the border. Every [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=55.64s)]
*  state is now a border state. It has now reached every corner of our country. It is wreaking [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=60.6s)]
*  havoc on our biggest cities and even small towns. And sadly, all of it was preventable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=66.12s)]
*  This is all a direct result of Joe Biden's failures, his dereliction of duty, his unwillingness [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=72.12s)]
*  to enforce the law and uphold his oath to our Constitution. And by the way, this is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=77.64s)]
*  the administration that inherited what was the most secure border in U.S. history. But [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Joe has worked to undo every single Trump-era policy that worked. And on day one, by the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=87.92s)]
*  way, it was Biden. He signed the executive orders that revoked Trump's efforts to exclude [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=93.92s)]
*  illegal immigrants from the sentence. He strengthened DACA. He canceled Trump's interior enforcement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=98.64s)]
*  rule. He halted border wall construction. He ended the remain in Mexico policy. And [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=103.88s)]
*  he let Title 42 expire, among other things. It's time for Joe now to simply, he did all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=109.84s)]
*  that with the stroke of a pen. Well, one more stroke of the pen. He can reinstate the Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=115.84s)]
*  policies that secured our border in the first place. This is now a clear matter of national [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=120.16s)]
*  security. Stop saying Congress needs to do this. You're the one that undid it. You're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  the one that can fix it yourself. But he doesn't want to do it. Thousands of illegal immigrants [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=131.52s)]
*  pouring in from some of our biggest adversaries, thousands from Afghanistan and Egypt, hundreds [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=136.56s)]
*  from Iran and Syria, tens of thousands from Russia and China. And here are the questions [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  that no one seems to be asking. Why are they coming from those long distances to get to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=148.08s)]
*  our southern border? Why are we allowing them to do so? And as I've been warning, I would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  say with almost 100% certainty, and again, I pray I'm wrong. I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  The terrorists are taking advantage of Joe's open borders, and there are terror cells likely [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=164.2s)]
*  in this country plotting, planning, scheming, and attacking against our homeland. And the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=169.32s)]
*  blame for that will lie squarely on the shoulders of Joe Biden. But things are only getting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  worse. Once again, according to brand new CBP data, well, the record for illegal immigrants [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=179.48s)]
*  entering our country, that was shattered in the month of December for the last one month [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=185.16s)]
*  ago with an astounding 371,000 encounters. But that did not stop Biden from telling reporters [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=189.92s)]
*  yesterday, yeah, I did all I can to secure the border. You did all you could to open the border. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=198.88s)]
*  That's as big a lie as him telling us for three years. The border's closed. The border's secure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=204.72s)]
*  The border's closed. The border's secure. Here's a quick reminder. Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. We've now gotten control. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=216.64s)]
*  Precisely that. The border is closed. Nor could I have been clearer and continued to be so, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=220.72s)]
*  which is the border is closed. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  our border. The border, we are working to make the border more secure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=234.16s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=240.0s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  including ours and our administration. We agree that the border is secure. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  They're all just flat out lying to all of us. Biden now changing his tune and saying, oh, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  Congress needs to pass a bill that'll secure the border. Joe says he will let in what, a few [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=263.28s)]
*  thousand illegal immigrants every single day. That's not a closed border. That's insane. There [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=268.56s)]
*  should be zero. Joe doesn't need Congress to do his job. Joe can reinstate the policies that worked [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=273.92s)]
*  under the last administration with a stroke of a pen, just like he rescinded them with a stroke of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=280.48s)]
*  a pen. Here's Donald Trump from earlier today. Take a look. You have the right to close up your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=285.36s)]
*  border. You don't need bills that complicate it and make it to a level that nobody's going to be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=290.56s)]
*  able to do it. And the minimum was five thousand people a day, if that can be right. It's hard to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=296.88s)]
*  believe that that can be right, but they were negotiating to allow five thousand people a day. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=301.68s)]
*  That's a tremendous amount. Nobody wants to have that happen to our country, and they're still not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=307.92s)]
*  going to know where they're coming from. Right now, we have no idea who these people are that are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=313.28s)]
*  pouring into our countries. Is anyone really surprised things have gotten this far out of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=319.76s)]
*  control? Remember, in 2020, it was Biden repeatedly promising to halt deportations in his first hundred [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=324.8s)]
*  days and only deport illegal immigrants who have committed a felony on our soil. You might remember [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=332.0s)]
*  this. Take a look. Should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=338.16s)]
*  should that person be deported? That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  fundamentally change the way we deal with it. What exact changes would you bring to ICE as an agency? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=349.92s)]
*  I would hold ICE agents accountable if, in fact, they stepped over my executive order. You only [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=356.32s)]
*  arrest for the purpose of dealing with a felony that's committed, and I don't count drunk driving [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=362.0s)]
*  as a felony. I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires access to citizenship for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=368.0s)]
*  11 million undocumented folks. Number one. Number two, in the first hundred days of my administration, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=374.8s)]
*  no one, no one will be deported at all. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=380.16s)]
*  are commissions of felonies in the United States of America. So to be clear, only felons get deported [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=386.72s)]
*  and everyone else is to stay? Period. Yes. Nobody, and some of you are going to get mad at me with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=392.8s)]
*  this, but nobody is going to be deported in my first hundred days until we get through the port [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  that we find out the only rationale for deportation will be whether or not, whether or not you've [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=404.24s)]
*  committed a felony while in the country. Side note. Do you notice the significant cognitive [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=411.12s)]
*  decline now? Do you see how dramatic it's been? Let me be clear as it relates to the board. The [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=418.24s)]
*  situation there is the direct result of Biden's dereliction of duty. It is a major national security [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=423.76s)]
*  crisis. It is a clear and present danger. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=431.44s)]

*  not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96_cxaOE2w&t=442.64s)]
