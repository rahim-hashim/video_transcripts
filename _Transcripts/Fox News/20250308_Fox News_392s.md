# Bitcoin has proven to be a very good investment, David Sacks says
**Fox News:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso)
*  today. He had to break it down. The president's AI and crypto czar, David Sachs, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. I got a lot to ask you because I did invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I watched the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=5.44s)]
*  fluctuations. If you tried for the entire hour to explain to me Bitcoin's algorithm, and I have had [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=11.84s)]
*  friends spend hours trying to get this through my thick skull, you will never be able to penetrate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=20.56s)]
*  the way my brain thinks and I will never get an understanding of it. However, it has proven to be [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=27.2s)]
*  a pretty good investment for me. What do you make of the president's crypto and what do you make of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=33.44s)]
*  the fluctuations in the crypto market? Well, Sean, good to be here. You're right. Bitcoin [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=37.76s)]
*  has proven over time to be a very good investment. It has proven to be very secure. The thing you [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=43.68s)]
*  just need to know about the security of the protocol is that it's worked. Bitcoin has now [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=47.76s)]
*  been around for over 15 years. The price has gone up from basically zero to roughly $90,000 per coin. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=51.76s)]
*  We think this stuff is scarce. It's like digital gold. We want to keep it at a digital Fort Knox. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=58.48s)]
*  Now, what we're talking about is Bitcoin that's already on the federal balance sheet. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=63.44s)]
*  The federal government, as a result of civil and criminal seizures and forfeitures, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=67.92s)]
*  had accumulated roughly 400,000 Bitcoin over the past decade. Unfortunately, the federal government [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=73.36s)]
*  sold off roughly half of that at very low prices. I think we made something like $400 million or [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=79.28s)]
*  less than $400 million. If we had held that Bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=84.48s)]
*  That has caused taxpayers dearly that we do not have a long-term strategy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=89.84s)]
*  President Trump has now signed an executive order. We talked about it at the crypto summit [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We think we've got about 200,000 Bitcoin left. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=97.76s)]
*  We want to maximize the value of those. The way that you do them is you hold them for the long term. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=102.4s)]
*  That's what we're doing. We're creating a digital Fort Knox. I should just say one more thing, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=106.4s)]
*  which is we don't know for sure that there is 200,000 Bitcoin left because no one's ever done [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  a full and complete accounting or audit. That is one of the things that President Trump has directed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  is we need to do a full accounting right away. Everything needs to be audited because we need [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=118.48s)]
*  to maximize the value of these assets for the American people. Okay. I don't tell people how [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=122.4s)]
*  to invest because I'm not an expert. I'm definitely not an expert on crypto. With that said, I do read [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=127.68s)]
*  a lot and I do talk to a lot of people that know a lot more about it than I do. You have people like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=134.88s)]
*  Michael Seller, for example, who I'm sure you're very familiar with, extraordinarily bullish. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=140.4s)]
*  I've interviewed him once. Extraordinarily bullish on the future of Bitcoin. Where do you see Bitcoin [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=144.72s)]
*  going yourself in terms of how high does it ultimately go? Well, John, I don't want to be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  in the business of making predictions around the prices of assets. I don't measure the success of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=160.72s)]
*  what I'm doing based on price levels, but really based on innovation levels. I'm a policy advisor [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=170.0s)]
*  for innovation. The last thing I want to do is come on your show and tell people to buy a particular [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=175.36s)]
*  asset. What I can tell you is that if you look at the historical trend, Bitcoin has gone up over time, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=180.72s)]
*  but with huge and volatile swings. As an asset, it's not necessarily for everyone. If you're a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=187.44s)]
*  retiree on a fixed income and you might need the money anytime soon, you should talk to your [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=192.56s)]
*  financial advisor. But I would tell you, don't do it. If you're a young person and this is surplus [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=197.44s)]
*  funds and you can afford to take a risk, then talk to your financial advisor about doing it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=202.24s)]
*  So I think that ultimately your risk profile has to matter in a decision like that. But what I can [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=206.48s)]
*  tell you is if you look at the 15-year track record of Bitcoin, it's basically gone from zero or [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=211.2s)]
*  almost nothing to 90,000 roughly. So it has over time with wild swings proven to be a good investment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=216.4s)]
*  And I wish that the federal government had held onto all of its Bitcoin instead of selling half [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  of it so cheaply. Okay. Maybe a better way to kind of get you off the hook and you're not going to be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=228.16s)]
*  giving financial advice. And we'll use a disclaimer. This is you are not advising people one way or the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=233.68s)]
*  other. But you obviously believe in crypto. You obviously believe in its long-term viability. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=239.68s)]
*  You believe in its long-term future. You believe for a lot of people it will be a good investment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=248.72s)]
*  And you see, do you see anything that would inhibit its growth? One thing that's kind of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=255.44s)]
*  shocked me a little bit as I follow it and I'm on Coinbase, I see it every day, is the volatility is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=260.16s)]
*  very real. It's not for the fainthearted. And I look at it as a long-term investment. I'm not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=267.12s)]
*  betting the milk money on it, but it's been kind of a fun little hobby of mine. But overall, are you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=272.4s)]
*  bullish on the idea that crypto is here to stay and its value? There will only be a finite number [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=279.6s)]
*  of, for example, Bitcoin. Are you bullish that it will maintain value? Do you think the odds are very [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=286.32s)]
*  high knowing the volatility aspect of it? Well, the reason why Bitcoin has maintained its value [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=292.08s)]
*  is because it's scarce. The Bitcoin protocol only allows for the creation of 21 million Bitcoin. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=299.84s)]
*  Now, if anybody ever figures out how to create a counterfeit Bitcoin, fake Bitcoin, or it's a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=305.76s)]
*  problem called double spending, then all Bitcoin could become worthless. But no one has figured out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=310.96s)]
*  how to do that. And we're talking about now a system that's been around for roughly 15 years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's been a long time. And Bitcoin now has something like a $2 trillion market cap. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=321.2s)]
*  And you can think of that market cap as a huge bug bounty or incentive for hackers to try and figure [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=325.68s)]
*  out how to break the security of Bitcoin and create fake Bitcoin. Nobody's been able to do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=331.36s)]
*  And so as Bitcoin has become a bigger and bigger target, it has proven to be more and more resistant [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=335.92s)]
*  against these attacks. And that, I think, has led to more confidence and more acceptance throughout [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=342.56s)]
*  the world. So Bitcoin is accepted by huge numbers of people all over the world who view it as, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=347.36s)]
*  again, a kind of digital gold. Or it's known as a store of value. And so I do think that as long as [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=353.04s)]
*  the acceptance keeps growing the way it has and the security remains intact, then I do think that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  long term it will do well. Yeah. By the way, and David, I can't emphasize enough to people, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=365.44s)]
*  don't make any financial investments without talking to professionals. I don't know enough [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=371.6s)]
*  about it. So I think that's sound advice and we appreciate your time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKYCgxJNUso&t=376.08s)]
