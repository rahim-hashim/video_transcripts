# Benjamin Netanyahu: This ‘rogue’ prosecutor has gone ‘amuck’
**Fox News:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. Yesterday, Sean spoke with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, just one day after an international criminal court prosecutor requested [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=6.12s)]
*  a warrant for Bibi's arrest over alleged war crimes. Take a look. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=11.42s)]
*  Joining us now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Prime Minister, always great [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=17.36s)]
*  to have you. Well, I wish under better circumstances. So I'm watching this illegitimate, you know, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=24.2s)]
*  court, the ICC and this indictment of you. And I'm thinking, okay, I'm sort of comparing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=31.36s)]
*  it to 9-11 in our country. And we lost 2,977 Americans. Now, based on the population size [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=37.6s)]
*  of Israel, and you know I've been there many times, it would be the equivalent of what [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=47.14s)]
*  happened October 7 to losing 40,000 Americans in a single day. Why you, as the prime minister [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=52.16s)]
*  of your country, defending yourself against these radical Islamists, attacking and killing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  your people and kidnapping your people, and somehow everything is so upside down that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=68.88s)]
*  you're the problem and there's a moral equivalency with Israel defending itself and radical terrorists? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=75.44s)]
*  Well, you know, it's outrageous. I think President Biden said that and Republicans [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=83.08s)]
*  and Democrats have rallied around this, you know, the effort to fight this absurdity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=91.08s)]
*  I mean, this is a rogue prosecutor who's gone amok. He's out to demonize the one [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=97.44s)]
*  and only Jewish state and the only democracy in the Middle East. And it's very, it's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=103.28s)]
*  both false and dangerous. False because, first of all, he's creating a false symmetry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=108.0s)]
*  As you said, between the democratically elected leaders of Israel and the terrorist tyrants [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=111.48s)]
*  of Hamas, and that's exactly like saying, well, I'm going to issue arrest warrants [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=118.36s)]
*  for President George W. Bush, but also bin Laden, or in World War II, I'm going to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=123.42s)]
*  issue arrest warrants for Churchill and FDR, but also for Hitler. Thanks a lot. It's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=128.56s)]
*  a false symmetry. It's despicable symmetry. And of course, this prosecutor never goes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=133.6s)]
*  after the tyrants of Tehran or the butchers of Syria or what is happening in Yemen, the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=139.12s)]
*  killers of Yemen or anywhere else or North Korea, anywhere else. He's going after us [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=144.52s)]
*  because he's out to demonize Israel and really fan the flames of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  The second thing is the charges are false. He's accusing us of deliberate starvation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=155.0s)]
*  What a pack of lies. I mean, we're putting in, we put in 20,000 trucks, 500,000 tons [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  of food and medicine. The price of food in Gaza has plummeted because markets don't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=167.64s)]
*  lie. We've got, people receive about 3,000 calories per day compared to the 2,000 that's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=175.16s)]
*  required. It's a bunch of baloney. And yet, you know, if you repeat a lie often enough [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  and if you have slanted urine organizations dominated by Hamas and its killers to give [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=187.16s)]
*  you these information, it's completely false. So I think he's, he didn't even bother [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  to investigate. I don't know if you know that. He just received these false contentious [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=197.14s)]
*  and misleading charges and took them as face value and then slammed this on Israel. So [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=202.33999999999997s)]
*  it's false, but let me tell you why it's dangerous. Because, Sean, Israel is first, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  but America is next and all democracies are next. Because if this is allowed to, if Israel [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=214.22s)]
*  is bullied into not stopping these terrorists and getting rid of these terrorists, then [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=219.98s)]
*  all democracies will be in peril. And it's also dangerous because he's pouring gasoline [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=224.64s)]
*  on the fires of anti-Semitism that are raging on U.S. campuses and around the world because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  people think this is a serious organization, the ICC. It'll take time for them to know [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=235.32s)]
*  what a farce it is. And so he's really stoking the fires of Jew hatred around the world and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  it never stops with Jew hatred. It inflames entire societies. You see that on the campuses [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=250.6s)]
*  President Trump, he withdrew from this. President Biden went back into it. I know he condemned [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=252.48s)]
*  it, however, the fact that I think America should pull out again as a result of this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=258.24s)]
*  I think every Western country should pull out and have no association with it, which [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=263.96s)]
*  brings up the broader question. And I've said this for years, that look at the U.N., [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=267.72s)]
*  for example. They have historically been anti-Semitic and anti-American. Why are we funding, with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=272.0s)]
*  U.S. tax dollars, the majority of funds for the U.N.? What about the WHO? They lied to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=279.2s)]
*  the world about COVID. Why the WEF? Why the Paris climate accords that, you know, grant [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=283.96s)]
*  the status of developing nations to China and India? How does any—how do any of these [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=290.32s)]
*  globalist organizations make any sense? This one is probably the worst of all of them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, certainly going down that route, you know, people used to take the General Assembly [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=301.64s)]
*  of the U.N. seriously. Well, it passed more resolutions against Israel than all the—I [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=306.76s)]
*  think all the other countries combined. The so-called Human Rights Council of the U.N. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=311.24s)]
*  also taken seriously. And then people saw that it passed more resolutions on Israel [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=316.44s)]
*  than all the rest of the world combined, including North Korea, Iran, Yemen, Syria, you name [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=321.48s)]
*  it. So obviously, they lost all their legitimacy. And this rogue prosecutor, with his false [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=326.36s)]
*  symmetries and his false charges, is doing exactly the same to the world—to this ICC. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=333.36s)]
*  And it remains to be seen whether the judges will go down that route, too. They might. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  And then it will become a kangaroo court for all the world to see. So I think that's—you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=345.68s)]
*  know, that's—if he wants to put a stain on Israel, he's putting a stain on himself. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'm very glad now that in the U.S. Congress there is a very strong effort, which is bipartisan, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  and I hope it continues to conclusion—I'm sure it will—to put sanctions on anyone [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=362.92s)]
*  who does this in the ICC. I think it's the least that should be done. And I expect it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=367.68s)]
*  to have a lasting effect. I think it's important. I'm very glad to see a lot of countries, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  a lot of serious leaders, have stood up and said, this is absurd. We can't accept this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, this would be the same as George W. Bush, after 9-11, being indicted the same [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=385.16s)]
*  way you were. Listen, the only people Israel is guilty of willfully killing are terrorists, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=390.6s)]
*  the people that started the war. So let's be very clear. Let me ask you another question [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=397.88s)]
*  and move on to a different topic. And I know Israel said they had no part to play at all [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=401.52s)]
*  in the helicopter crash of the Iranian president. Better known, by the way, is the butcher of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=408.88s)]
*  Iran. And what bothers me, though, is the Biden State Department sent Iran condolences. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=415.68s)]
*  The U.N. held the moment of silence. Now, the number one state sponsor of terror, Mr. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=423.64s)]
*  Prime Minister, the last time I checked, was the Islamic Republic, Iran. They helped plan [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=428.44s)]
*  and plot and scheme and provide weaponry for the October 7 attacks against your country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=435.6s)]
*  They're providing Hezbollah in the north, in Lebanon, with weapons to fire into your [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=441.24s)]
*  country. They are arming the Houthi rebels, also firing weapons and rockets into your [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=445.26s)]
*  country. And why would anybody offer condolences to the death of one of the worst terrorists [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=450.92s)]
*  in world history? Can you explain that? Because I'm not that happy that my country did that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=458.08s)]
*  Well, you'll have to ask the administration that question, but I'll tell you who I offer [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=463.08s)]
*  condolences to. I offer condolences to the people of Iran who have been terrorized and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=469.56s)]
*  subjugated by these theocratic thugs for half a century. I mean, they've killed them on [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=474.16s)]
*  the sidewalks. They don't let them raise their voice. They promote terrorism around [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=481.72s)]
*  the world, but they also do horrible things to their own people. So I offer my condolences [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=487.28s)]
*  to the Iranian people, and I hope they get rid of this tyranny as soon as they can. I [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=492.72s)]
*  think that that's been my position all along, and I think that's the right position. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3VY1u2KHfQ&t=497.52s)]
