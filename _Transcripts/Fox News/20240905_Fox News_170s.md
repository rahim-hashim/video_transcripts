# I was the ‘toughest’ on Russia: Trump
**Fox News:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ)
*  and they have an agenda. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  They've never played Kamala in her own words, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=2.0s)]
*  her radical statements, her extreme statements, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=4.5s)]
*  I think dangerous statements. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=6.9s)]
*  And I just think that if we're talking about the border, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=8.8s)]
*  all of these 11 million, it was all preventable. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=11.86s)]
*  I think on the economy, if you had sound economic policy, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=15.08s)]
*  you handed off 1.4% inflation, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=18.42s)]
*  we'd be doing better in the economy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=21.52s)]
*  We'd be energy dominant by now, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=23.34s)]
*  because we were on a path towards energy dominance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=25.14s)]
*  We wouldn't have to, Iran was in check. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=28.3s)]
*  You had them on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=30.78s)]
*  Russia, you had a relationship with them, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=33.06s)]
*  and North Korea, and the Moors, and the Moors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  But nobody was tougher with Russia than me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  I shut down the biggest pipeline in the world [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  that Russia was building. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=43.46s)]
*  It was called Nord Stream 2. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=44.42s)]
*  Nobody ever heard of it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  And I said, no way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=47.1s)]
*  I said to Germany, there's no way [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  we're gonna protect you with NATO [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=51.5s)]
*  and spend billions of dollars protecting Europe, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=53.1s)]
*  and you guys are gonna be buying oil from the person [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=55.5s)]
*  and the group that we're protecting you from. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=57.94s)]
*  And I shut it down. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  It was 100% shut down. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=61.54s)]
*  And then this pathetic person comes in, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=63.5s)]
*  and he immediately approves it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=67.5s)]
*  But he shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, our pipeline. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=69.42s)]
*  And the head of that union, by the way, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=75.78s)]
*  the pipe fitters union, the pipeline union, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=77.38s)]
*  the head of that union nominated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=80.86s)]
*  and was a big deal in the Biden campaign, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=83.9s)]
*  and he endorsed him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=86.48s)]
*  And those people, 48,000 people lost their jobs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  It was all approved. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=92.04s)]
*  I got it approved. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  Obama rejected it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  I approved it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  It was starting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=96.72s)]
*  They spent billions of dollars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=97.84s)]
*  It was all so, and they rejected. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  It would have been fantastic for us, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  including the 48,000 jobs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=103.4s)]
*  And what he did is he let Russia [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=106.0s)]
*  build the pipeline that I had stopped. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=110.4s)]
*  It was totally stopped. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Going to Germany and other countries, think of it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=113.42s)]
*  We protect them from Russia, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=115.84s)]
*  and yet they pay Russia billions of dollars. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Does it make sense? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=122.2s)]
*  So I was the toughest on Russia. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=123.04s)]
*  Putin would even say, you know, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  if you're not the toughest guy, you are. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=127.56s)]
*  You're killing us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=130.32s)]
*  I'd hate to see you if you were really tough. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=131.36s)]
*  This was the biggest job they've ever had, and I stopped it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=133.8s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=138.3s)]
*  Russia would have been fine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  China would have been fine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=141.0s)]
*  China was fine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=142.4s)]
*  China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=143.32s)]
*  in taxes and tariffs under me, under no other president. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=147.32s)]
*  And I mean, right from the beginning, did they pay 10 cents? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=151.56s)]
*  Now we're gonna get to audience questions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B04oxKcWwQ&t=155.28s)]
