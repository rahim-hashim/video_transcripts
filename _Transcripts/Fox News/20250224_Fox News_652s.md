# Sean Hannity: Trumpâ€™s picking up win after win
**Fox News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0)
*  Hi, welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, President Trump's effort to secure your border is working. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=2.0s)]
*  On Saturday, border crossings, they dropped to their lowest level in 15 years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=5.68s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem brings us the very latest in just [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=10.24s)]
*  a moment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=14.4s)]
*  Also, it is official, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=15.4s)]
*  He has now launched his campaign for governor in the great state of Ohio, the Buckeye State. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=17.92s)]
*  You don't want to miss out our interview with him coming up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=23.04s)]
*  But first, President Trump continues to work at record-breaking speed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=26.0s)]
*  He's showing no signs of slowing down at all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  Earlier today, he hosted French President Emmanuel Macron for a meeting at the White [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=33.28s)]
*  House where the two addressed a number of topics and also expressed optimism about resolving [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=38.44s)]
*  the war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=47.0s)]
*  I've been elected by the American people to restore common sense to Washington and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=48.0s)]
*  indeed to the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=55.66s)]
*  And I believe strongly that it's in the best interest of the United States, the best interest [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=57.18s)]
*  in Europe, the best interest of Ukraine, and indeed the best interest of Russia to stop [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=62.12s)]
*  the killing now and bring the world to peace. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=66.66s)]
*  When I got here, one of the first calls I made was to President Putin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=70.34s)]
*  And we were treated with great respect. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=74.6s)]
*  And they want to end this war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=76.42s)]
*  So that's a big thing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=79.5s)]
*  I will be meeting with President Zelensky. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=80.5s)]
*  In fact, he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement, which would be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=82.7s)]
*  nice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=87.9s)]
*  I'd love to meet him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=88.9s)]
*  We'd meet at the Oval Office. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=89.9s)]
*  So the agreement's being worked on now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=91.94s)]
*  They're very close to a final deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=94.02s)]
*  It'll be a deal with rare earths and various other things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=96.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=100.62s)]
*  President Trump also continues to score big wins on the economy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=102.42s)]
*  Remember, the left, the media mob, spent months and months and months spewing doom [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  and gloom predictions about Donald Trump and his proposed tariffs, which are now reciprocal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=110.86s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=115.9s)]
*  They tariff us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=116.9s)]
*  OK, we'll tariff you back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=117.9s)]
*  Well, Gabe, what arena do you want to play in? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=118.9s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=121.38s)]
*  In response to President Trump's proposed tariffs this morning, a huge announcement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=122.38s)]
*  from Apple, a historic $500 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and innovation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=127.38s)]
*  The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, says he is bullish on the future of American innovation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=134.98s)]
*  This one deal is expected to create tens of thousands of new jobs and a new manufacturing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=141.14s)]
*  plant in Texas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=147.02s)]
*  God bless Texas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=148.02s)]
*  Now, let me say this, by the way, on the issue of tariffs in Canada. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=149.02s)]
*  There is a movement, was in today's New York Post, that Canadians might be boycotting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=152.5s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=157.9s)]
*  Now, I have a message to Canada, too. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=159.26s)]
*  If you don't appreciate everything the U.S. has been doing for your national defense, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=161.94s)]
*  for NATO that you've not been paying, and that has helped your economy, and if you want [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  to boo our national anthem because we call you out for not securing your border or the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=173.62s)]
*  fact that you have tariffs on our country, it's not going to fly anymore. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=179.5s)]
*  Friendships have got to work both ways. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=183.86s)]
*  In Canada, you have a population of little over 41 million people, and the U.S. has over [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  340 million people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=191.46s)]
*  Now, I'm just saying, I've never supported a boycott my entire career. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=193.46s)]
*  But if this Boycott America movement from Canada gets legs, then maybe I'll do something [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=198.86s)]
*  I've never done before in my career. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=203.82s)]
*  Maybe we can start and support a boycott movement of Canada. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=206.34s)]
*  Let's put the ball back in your court. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=210.86s)]
*  You might want to rethink this idea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=212.62s)]
*  It's better off if we're friends. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=214.34s)]
*  And while President Trump secures massive investments in the U.S., Elon Musk and Doge [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  continue to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, abuse and corruption right here at [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=221.26s)]
*  home, an effort that JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says needs to be done since the government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=225.42s)]
*  is, quote, inefficient. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=231.26s)]
*  That's stating the obvious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=232.26s)]
*  According to one former DOD insider, Doge is sending, quote, shockwaves through the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=233.82s)]
*  Pentagon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  And over at the EPA, another $67 million of your money in grants for left-wing groups [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=241.66s)]
*  pushing Joe Biden's radical environmental justice mandate? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  That's gone. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=251.58s)]
*  And over the weekend, Fox News learned that Border Patrol has now taken controlâ€”you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=252.58s)]
*  got to admit, this is funnyâ€”of the former USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C., after [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=257.14s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doge exposed the tens of billions of dollars of that organization's wasteful [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  spending. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=269.14s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=270.14s)]
*  That's money for our kids and grandkids to pay down our debt, create the new generation [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=271.14s)]
*  of weaponry, including an iron dome for the country, secure our borders, become energy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=274.94s)]
*  dominant, bring back law and order. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Not a bad agenda. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=281.34s)]
*  Better alternative. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  Now, despite all of the work that the president is doing to make our country a better place, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  oh, the mainstream media, legacy media mob and liberal political strategists and Democrats, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  they just don't get it, or they don't want to get it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=295.46s)]
*  That's why you're seeing yet another reconfiguration of the mainstream media, and people no longer [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  trust them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=304.46s)]
*  Ask yourself, do you really think it's an accident that Chuck Todd, Andrea Mitchell, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=305.46s)]
*  Nora O'Donnell, Joy Reid, Alex Wagner, all pushed either out the door or taking on reduced [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=308.58s)]
*  roles? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=316.22s)]
*  Ask yourself. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=317.22s)]
*  In another example last week, we tried to have a conversation with our old friend James [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=318.22s)]
*  Carville. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=321.62s)]
*  Now, to me, he's always been more reasonable as a Democrat. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=322.62s)]
*  Remember Bill Clinton, Al Gore? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=325.58s)]
*  They talked a lot about ending waste, fraud and abuse, but frankly, the conversation was [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  more than frustrating. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=332.9s)]
*  We went back and forth about various numbers, and then he said to fact check them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  All right, so we're going to do just that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=339.42s)]
*  On the issue, he kept saying, lowest poll numbers ever, anybody? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=342.18s)]
*  Preaching president modern history. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=345.46s)]
*  Not true. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=347.02s)]
*  Got it wrong. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=348.02s)]
*  According to the new Harvard-Harris poll just out this very day, President Trump approval [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=349.02s)]
*  rating is 52 percent, nine points above water. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=353.14s)]
*  The poll found that voters are now more optimistic about the direction of the country since the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump administration took over. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=362.82s)]
*  And on every major issue, they support the Trump agenda. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  Despite the disaster Biden left behind, 38 percent now say the economy is on the right [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=369.05999999999995s)]
*  track, which is 10 points higher than it was only last month. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  In fact, President Trump is outperforming Biden on handling every key issue, including [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=376.61999999999995s)]
*  immigration, the economy, inflation, foreign affairs. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=381.46s)]
*  He is in the 60s and 70s when it comes to government waste, fraud and abuse and reducing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  the cost of government and returning all of that money to you and returning America [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=389.8s)]
*  to a position of strength on the world stage. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=395.12s)]
*  On the issue of Doge, a whopping 77 percent of respondents think that we are in need of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=397.36s)]
*  a full examination of all government expenditures. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=402.38s)]
*  Ah, guess James was wrong. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  But it's not just Harvard-Harris. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=407.76s)]
*  President Trump is above water in the latest Rasmussen tracking poll, the latest RMG research [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=409.48s)]
*  poll. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=414.68s)]

*  double that under Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=511.70000000000005s)]

*  of waste in that organization, all for radical left-wing causes and what it would do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=520.38s)]

*  The left does not want to talk about Donald Trump's accomplishments. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=570.74s)]
*  They don't want to talk about waste, fraud and abuse going on in our government. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=574.58s)]
*  And that's what they consider a constitutional crisis. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=578.9s)]
*  The problem with the left today, if you're asking why all these Trump haters are falling [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=582.7800000000001s)]
*  by the wayside all over the corrupt state-run legacy media mob, it's because they simply [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=588.22s)]
*  hate Trump and desperately want him to fail. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=593.5s)]
*  He fails, the country fails. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=596.86s)]
*  And this reshuffling strategy of these networks, you know, you're reshuffling the decks of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=598.72s)]
*  the Titanic, it's not going to work for them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=602.82s)]
*  People have too many choices, too many alternatives, and moving forward, I can tell you that you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=605.2600000000001s)]
*  better tell all the people truth, like Joe's cognitive state, like the border was never [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=610.5799999999999s)]

*  Breaking tonight, a judge has sided with the Trump administration and is not overturning [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UikbKS2OT-0&t=619.74s)]
