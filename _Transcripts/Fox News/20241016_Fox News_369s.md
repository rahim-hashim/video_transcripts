# What page are you turning, Kamala Harris?: Eric Trump
**Fox News:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo)
*  Vice President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, Eric, she was on with Charlemagne [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=0.0s)]
*  the God, and, you know, now she's open to reparations and now she's open to giving [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=4.64s)]
*  money that would be available only to African Americans. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=9.74s)]
*  And if she runs out of answers, she always goes back to, did you know I grew up in a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  middle-class family? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=17.78s)]
*  And the word salads on Charlemagne the God. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=19.18s)]
*  My agenda is about tapping into the ambitions, aspirations, knowing that folks want to have [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=21.84s)]
*  an opportunity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  They want, they should have the meaningful opportunity for intergenerational wealth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=27.56s)]
*  And I'm like, how about you answer questions? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=31.72s)]
*  Why do you support the Green New Deal? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=33.68s)]
*  Why do you support abandoning the filibuster? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  Why are you against fracking and drilling? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=38.48s)]
*  Why do you, why do you want to give sex change operations that have wide open borders, people [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=40.48s)]
*  that murder, rape, that are criminals, murderers in this country, drug cartels? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=44.4s)]
*  You know, why do you want defund, dismantle, no bail laws? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=49.44s)]
*  These are not tough questions, Eric. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=53.4s)]
*  Why do you want to eliminate private health insurance? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=55.68s)]
*  Pretty easy to me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=57.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=58.84s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's because they're not serious people, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=59.84s)]
*  And I think it's why you just mentioned the polymarket odds right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=63.2s)]
*  It's 58-42 in favor of my father. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=65.84s)]
*  They're not serious people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=68.48s)]
*  And Dave Portnoy was 100 percent right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=70.84s)]
*  That's all she does. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=73.2s)]
*  Let's turn the page. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=74.2s)]
*  Let's turn the page. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=75.2s)]
*  Well, Kamala, Democrats have occupied the White House 12 out of the last 16 years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=76.2s)]
*  What page are you turning? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  What proposal, what policy have you put in place? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=82.12s)]
*  What quantitative measure have you put in place in the last four years that's not a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=84.64s)]
*  single thing to further this country? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=90.08s)]
*  And the answer is absolutely none. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=92.28s)]
*  And he's absolutely right in terms of the gaslighting. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=94.88s)]
*  You literally see the greatest rebranding of any person in the history of the world [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=97.08s)]
*  with the media and Kamala over the last nine weeks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=100.76s)]
*  Literally 10 weeks ago, Sean, you had The Washington Post that was calling for her to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=105.16s)]
*  resign out of the race to set aside for the good of the country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=108.72s)]
*  The New York Times was doing the same thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=113.36s)]
*  And then she didn't step aside. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=115.96s)]
*  She obviously—we all know what happened. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, and look at her now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Everybody, you know, pretends she's a modern-day Margaret Thatcher, and she's not. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=121.44s)]
*  Her policies are awful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  She was supposed to be a border czar. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=126.24s)]
*  She did a terrible job. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=127.72s)]
*  She was supposed to take on, you know, AI, did a terrible job, didn't do a single thing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=128.76s)]
*  with that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=133.44s)]
*  We've lost 320,000 children to fentanyl. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=134.44s)]
*  We've had 20 million people come across the southern border. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=136.68s)]
*  Life in America is totally unaffordable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=139.56s)]
*  There's wars on every continent around the world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=141.32s)]
*  American standing has been reduced to absolute rubble, all because of this incompetence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  And then you get to hear, oh, yeah, we must turn the page. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=149.04s)]
*  You know, you see her going on shows called Call Her Daddy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=151.84s)]
*  What do you mean, turn the—Eric, wait a minute. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=154.48s)]
*  You know, Category 5 hurricanes are hitting Florida. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=155.72s)]
*  What do you mean— [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=157.32s)]
*  Turn the page, and then she says she wouldn't do anything differently than what Joe Biden [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=159.32s)]
*  did in the years that she was there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=164.72s)]
*  Look, let me ask you this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=166.6s)]
*  I was there with you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=169.0s)]
*  We've become friends. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=170.96s)]
*  We've known each other for many years before your father ever got into politics. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=171.96s)]
*  And I was there in the 2016 election. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  I was there for the 2020 election. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  At this point in time, in 16 and in 20, your dad was down anywhere between 6 and 9 points. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=180.64s)]
*  It was a 1.6—a real clear politics average separation today. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=189.32s)]
*  It has your father—the betting markets, people put money down based on the odds of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=196.6s)]
*  these markets. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=200.92s)]
*  They have your dad up by 16. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=201.92s)]
*  S Markets in Europe has your dad up by 14. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=203.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=207.56s)]
*  If people are going to put money down and you're going to have a betting website, I think the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=208.56s)]
*  odds are that you're not going to give odds like that unless you really feel strongly [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=213.0s)]
*  one candidate is going to beat another candidate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=216.92s)]
*  But you know, we'll see in 21 days. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=219.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, Sean, I think part of that's because she can't go through an interview and actually [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=223.6s)]
*  answer a question, have it have any substance or meaning despite being in the office for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=227.16s)]
*  the last four years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=231.16s)]
*  Her record's abysmal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=232.16s)]
*  Biden's record's abysmal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=233.16s)]
*  They've been lazy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=235.32s)]
*  They haven't represented this country well at all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=236.32s)]
*  And I think more important than that, Sean, my father has never been better than he is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=238.78s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=242.76s)]
*  I mean, he is so locked in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=243.76s)]
*  He is working so incredibly hard. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=244.76s)]
*  He is on the campaign trail literally 20 hours a day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=246.88s)]
*  He's hitting every single state. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  His message is resonating unlike anything I've ever seen before. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=252.4s)]
*  And I've been part of great campaigns, obviously, in 2016 and and everything that he's accomplished. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=255.2s)]
*  The man is absolutely on point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=260.28s)]
*  You saw what he did with Bloomberg today in that conference. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=262.3s)]
*  I mean, the entire place in a place that you wouldn't have otherwise would have been thought [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=264.76s)]
*  would have been friendly to him was literally eating out of his hands. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=269.16s)]
*  And people just want our nation back. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=271.8s)]
*  People want common sense restored in this country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=274.08s)]
*  People want red, white and blue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=277.16s)]
*  And they want our freedom of speech back and they want civility back and they want peace [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=278.7s)]
*  back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  They want a great economy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  They want affordable goods. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  And I don't care how many nonsense soundbites Kamala has. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=291.94s)]
*  It's just not working. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=292.94s)]
*  And that's why the African-American community has come over. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=293.94s)]
*  The Hispanic community has come over. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=295.74s)]
*  Youth voters are coming over in record numbers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you're seeing these these transformational shifts in American policies that you've just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=300.06s)]
*  never seen before in this country. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=305.48s)]
*  You know what it comes down to, and I'm going to let you go with this, that if you think [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  are you better off than you are four years ago? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=311.74s)]
*  The famous question, are the borders more safe and secure? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=314.74s)]
*  The answer is obvious. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=318.14s)]
*  How is law and order and safety and security in your town or your city? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=319.94s)]
*  How's the economy when you go into the grocery store? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=324.98s)]
*  How do you like paying a buck, buck fifty more plus a gallon of gasoline than you were [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=327.62s)]
*  paying under your father when he was president? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=332.18s)]
*  By every measure, how's America doing in its role in the world these days? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=335.78s)]
*  War in Europe, war in the Middle East. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, on every measure, I don't think we're better off. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=342.02s)]
*  And if people, if that becomes the question that they ask, I do believe your father will [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX-7_6mSMxo&t=345.17999999999995s)]
