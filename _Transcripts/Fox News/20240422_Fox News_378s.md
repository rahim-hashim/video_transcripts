# Robert Kraft to Hannity on the rise of antisemitism: 'It's very sad to me'
**Fox News:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I)
*  All right, this is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=0.0s)]
*  We are continuing to monitor the pro-Hamas protests in New York City. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=2.2s)]
*  Earlier tonight, police did clear out protesters at NYU in New York City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=6.08s)]
*  And we are now hearing, by the way, that they're marching toward New York Police Department [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=17.32s)]
*  Also tonight, as outrage grows over the continuing anti-Semitic protests on the campus of Columbia [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=18.32s)]
*  University, well, the school has just lost the financial support of one of their most [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=25.0s)]
*  prominent alumni. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=30.96s)]
*  New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has donated untold millions of dollars to Columbia. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=32.72s)]
*  And the school's Center for Jewish Life and its football field are both named after him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And Robert Kraft has renamed, remained active in the Columbia community for years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=44.5s)]
*  He's grateful. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=50.64s)]
*  that got his life kickstarted. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=52.64s)]
*  Anyway, appearing on campus, at school events, meeting with students and much more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=54.8s)]
*  He'd been very tied to the university, but now the blatant anti-Semitism on Columbia's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=60.36s)]
*  campus is simply too great to ignore. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=65.36s)]
*  In a statement today, Robert Kraft announced that he is, quote, not comfortable supporting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  the university until corrective action is taken, adding that Columbia is, quote, no [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=73.88s)]
*  longer an institution I recognize. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=79.32s)]
*  Anyway, here with more to explain the CEO of the New England Patriots, our friend Robert [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=82.11999999999999s)]
*  Kraft is back. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Robert, great to see you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Happy Passover. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=90.36s)]
*  Thank you for taking time to be with us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  It's great to be with you, Sean. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  You said it wasâ€” [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  You know, I met with that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  I'd see what's going on in America, what's happening right now, and it really pains me [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=102.72s)]
*  to see it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=110.84s)]
*  We have our holiday going on now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=112.88s)]
*  It goes back to memory of thousands of years ago where negative things were happening. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=115.32s)]
*  And the same is happening now in this great country that offered so many opportunities [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=124.36s)]
*  to our families who came here as immigrants. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=131.84s)]
*  And we have to keep it open. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=136.04s)]
*  We can't have this intimidation that's filtering through all these colleges and the hate continue [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=137.68s)]
*  to grow and multiply the way it is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=145.68s)]
*  You know, I never thought in our lifetime, Mr. Kraft, ever, that we would be where we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  are today. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=157.34s)]
*  I thought you summed it up very well, how saddened you are at the virulent hate that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=158.58s)]
*  continues to grow on campus and throughout the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=163.94s)]
*  You know, it's also the halls of Congress. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=168.34s)]
*  It's also all throughout Europe. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, I never thought out of Australia people would chant, gas the Jews, F the Jews, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=174.62s)]
*  Robert Kraft. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=182.26s)]
*  I never thought the world would turn this way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  I thought we would have learned from history. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  Clearly we've not. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=191.06s)]
*  Yeah, and it's very sad to me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=193.06s)]
*  And you know, we, you know, but look at America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=198.1s)]
*  We've done research and it shows 90 percent of the people in this country are good people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=202.94s)]
*  They just have to be educated and we can't have them apathetic or misguided. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=209.22s)]
*  We have to let them know and they have to stand up and not be silent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=216.54s)]
*  And you know, it starts with the Jews, but then every group that feels marginalized, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=223.94s)]
*  whether it be blacks, Asians, Hispanics, gay people, it'll just really impact the great [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=231.26s)]
*  fabric of this country where people have freedom to operate and go the way they want. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=238.54s)]
*  And now we have hatred and intimidation taking over. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=246.26s)]
*  And you know, I just thinking when I went to Columbia, it was a place where people listened, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=251.66s)]
*  where empathetic had compassion. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=258.94s)]
*  And now, you know, we have professors who instead of teaching how to think that they're [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  trying to tell our young people what they should think. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=270.14s)]
*  And I think one of the biggest problems that we have to do something about is really tenure [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=273.98s)]
*  in these universities where people can do things and don't have accountability. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=280.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=286.06s)]
*  You know, you have tenured professors there that were celebrating October 7th. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=288.06s)]
*  Twelve hundred Israelis were slaughtered that day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=293.58s)]
*  The number of children that were burned to death or decapitated, the rapes that took place, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=297.26s)]
*  the hostages that were taken. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=302.46s)]
*  You know, you talk with great affection about Columbia and then you say you're not comfortable [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=304.62s)]
*  supporting this university until corrective action is taken. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=309.98s)]
*  What corrective action would you insist on? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=313.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=316.3s)]
*  Well, I must point one little detail. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=317.98s)]
*  I do still support the Craft Center, which has been a haven for professors and students [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=321.02s)]
*  who don't feel safe. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  And I also have to compliment, you know, the mayor, Eric Adams, who I think he has been [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=331.82s)]
*  a stand up guy, the police, Governor Huckshell. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=338.86s)]
*  And really, you know, that's made me feel good to see that there are people like this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=342.7s)]
*  who aren't afraid to stand up and have the courage to say the right thing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=348.62s)]
*  Robert, this has to stop. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=354.46s)]
*  I think you need a new president there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=357.42s)]
*  And if these kids continue this, frankly, many of them need to be expelled. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=359.66s)]
*  Robert Kraft, thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLGCx5Rv_I&t=365.34000000000003s)]
