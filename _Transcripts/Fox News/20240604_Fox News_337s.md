# Democrats ‘bit off more than they could chew’ by going after Trump: Reince Priebus
**Fox News:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU)
*  House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, podcast host, Tudor Dixon. I said this on the first day back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=0.0s)]
*  after Christmas vacation, Tudor Dixon. I said, this is the Democratic playbook, January 6, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=7.68s)]
*  January 6, abortion. They're going to talk about democracy and peril. Then they're going to use [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=14.0s)]
*  the old playbook that Republicans are racist, sexist, and all the phobias you could ever imagine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=19.04s)]
*  And this is all they've got. And lawfare now seems to have now risen to the top of the heap [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  because they can't win on the proposition that you're better off than you were four years ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=31.84s)]
*  Well, they can't win on that. They can't win on the border, what you just talked about. So, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=39.28s)]
*  yes, of course, but this is happening all across the country. What they've done to Trump, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=42.64s)]
*  they're doing in states across the country. You see it in Michigan, you see it in Georgia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=47.76s)]
*  This is something that is incredibly dangerous. Attorneys general across the country think that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=51.84s)]
*  they can do this. But let's not forget, these are people who ran on creating a crime, matching the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=56.56s)]
*  president to the crime, and then putting him in prison. And now you have the president of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=62.56s)]
*  United States going, gosh, look, he is now, he's a convicted felon, and now you have to vote for me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=67.36s)]
*  I mean, this is one step away from Alexei Navalny. This is a very serious situation when you have the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=73.28s)]
*  president of the United States taking his opposition and jailing them. What's next? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=80.16s)]
*  And you're seeing this, like I said, you are seeing this in other states as well, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=85.28s)]
*  where they are either finding, oh, this person will be my opposition. I'm going to create a crime [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=89.44s)]
*  and match them to it. Or they're taking other people who have run and said, look, we want to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  make sure that they can't ever do it again, and we're going to find a crime and match them to it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  This is incredibly dangerous. If the American people do not see what is going on, then we will [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=104.24s)]
*  have Republicans jailed across this country. It is extraordinarily scary times in the United States [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=109.28s)]
*  of America. You know, we'll get to this in a little more detail later, Reince, but Director [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=115.76s)]
*  Ray has been warning in every appearance before Congress that the danger to this country has never [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=120.88s)]
*  been as loud as it is right now. It's never been this bad, is what he's saying. A lot of it has to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=126.48s)]
*  be where a lot of these illegal immigrants are coming from, Iran and Syria, tens and tens of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=134.64s)]
*  thousands, China and Russia and Egypt and Afghanistan and Yemen and Kazakhstan. I would argue it is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=140.72s)]
*  inevitable now. We have terror cells that Joe Biden has allowed into this country and the country's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=147.76s)]
*  going to get hit. Those two cops shot, Biden has blood on his hands. Any attack on this country, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  I blame Biden. He will have blood on his hands and he has failed this country. He's failed in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=160.16s)]
*  his duty as commander in chief, and that is to secure our border and prevent our geopolitical [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=165.84s)]
*  foes from entering unvetted. That's what is allowed to happen on top of the cost of everything. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=172.64s)]
*  Well, and it goes right to the heart of intent and competency of the president. I mean, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=180.24s)]
*  the intent is there. You hit on it before with Governor Abbott. On day one of his presidency, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=186.8s)]
*  he signed nine executive orders. Six of them had to do with immigration, and one of them was Stop [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=192.8s)]
*  the Wall. One of them was the executive order that he tried to put in today. We know it didn't really [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=198.72s)]
*  do that, but the Remain in Mexico policy. The third executive order he signed forced municipalities [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=205.36s)]
*  to count illegal immigrants in their census count so that those municipalities can get more money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=211.36s)]
*  That's the one untold story about this. If you ever wonder why are these municipalities [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  declaring themselves sanctuary cities, because they want more federal money and they've got a law [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=222.08s)]
*  that lets them get more federal money. And as far as what Tudor Dixon and you were just talking [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=227.52s)]
*  about, Alvin Bragg campaigned on the fact that he was the best situated to go after Trump because he [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=232.56s)]
*  went after his children. He went after the Trump org over 100 times. They made it political, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=241.04s)]
*  but look what happens. We have an election now a few months away, and what do you need to do to win [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  an election when only 100,000 people in five states are going to decide it? You need money [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=254.16s)]
*  and you need enthusiasm. There is no doubt that we have a party that's unified and off the charts now [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=259.68s)]
*  because of what happened and add on top of it the record amount of money that the party's raising. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=267.92s)]
*  I talked to the president a few days ago and I asked him a question. I said, other than the headache [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=273.76s)]
*  of this trial that you just went through, is there anything, anything right now not going well [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  in this campaign? He said none. Everything, it is off the charts right now and I think that the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=286.24s)]
*  Democrats bit off more than they could chew with this. If it's about the economy, if it's about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=292.96s)]
*  borders, if it's about law and order, if it's about you know war in Europe, war in the Middle East, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=298.64s)]
*  if it's about his surrender in the war on terrorism, if it's about his cognitive decline, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=304.56s)]
*  how does he ever win? If it's about lawfare, it's never been this bad and there's not a single thing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=310.08s)]
*  he can point to that he could say, oh my policies have been successful. Tudor Dixon, Reince Privas, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSt7Yzw1zmU&t=316.71999999999997s)]
