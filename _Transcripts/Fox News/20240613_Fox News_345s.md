# Biden is throwing Israel under the bus: Sen. Lindsey Graham
**Fox News:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y)
*  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  An awful lot of money's been spent in Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=3.04s)]
*  It seems in many ways that that has devolved into a proxy war between Joe Biden versus [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=7.72s)]
*  Putin or the U.S. versus Russia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=14.08s)]
*  American people are pretty angry about it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=17.12s)]
*  They're angry that Europe has not stepped up financially to protect their own continent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=19.12s)]
*  enough. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=24.84s)]
*  And then you got, what, $12 billion? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=25.84s)]
*  That's it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=28.6s)]
*  But even worse than that, Joe Biden will not allow Israel to fight the war they need to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=29.76s)]
*  win against radical Islamic terrorists that slaughtered them on October 7, took their [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=35.64s)]
*  own citizens hostage, Americans hostage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=40.92s)]
*  And he's lecturing Bibi Netanyahu the entire time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  He's not helping at all. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=49.84s)]
*  And the worst part is, he says the U.S. won't help in terms of offensively helping to win [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=51.52s)]
*  the war on terror. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=57.22s)]
*  Joe Biden has surrendered on the war against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=58.26s)]
*  Can you explain the disparity? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=62.06s)]
*  Because I can't. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=63.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=64.62s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=65.62s)]
*  Joe Biden is worried about losing support in Michigan. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=66.62s)]
*  He's throwing Israel under the bus. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=70.42s)]
*  There's been no better ally to the state of Israel than President Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=73.34s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=77.14s)]
*  He recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, not Syria. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=80.9s)]
*  Biden's withholding the weapons Israel needs to win a war they can't afford to lose. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=86.1s)]
*  Everywhere Israel looks, there are radical Islamists that want to cut their throat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  Here's my message to the state of Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Help is on the way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=98.08s)]
*  President Trump is coming back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=99.08s)]
*  Why are you so certain, Senator? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=102.13999999999999s)]
*  Because the American people have had enough of this four years of just misery. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=104.86s)]
*  Misery at home, misery abroad. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  What I would say today about the Senate engagement with President Trump, he was the team captain, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=113.86s)]
*  and we were glad he was leading us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=120.18s)]
*  Everybody in that room is dying for him to get back in office. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=123.06s)]
*  He wants us to win the Senate so we can put judges on the bench. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=127.02s)]
*  He talked about him helping us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=130.82s)]
*  It was the single best meeting I've ever seen between the United States Republican [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=133.4s)]
*  senators and President Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  He was in a good mood. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=139.66s)]
*  People appreciate him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=142.12s)]
*  He's leading in every state. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=145.0s)]
*  We need to win the Senate back. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=147.38s)]
*  He's doing better than every Republican Senate candidate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=149.92s)]
*  The road to the majority in the Senate is to marry up with President Trump and his agenda. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=153.26s)]
*  This was a positive meeting today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=159.04s)]
*  He talked about rebuilding this country, and I can't wait to have him back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=161.28s)]
*  Whether people agreed with you or didn't agree with you on your belief that there should [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=166.44s)]
*  be a federal 15-week ban or allowance on the issue of abortion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=171.62s)]
*  Put that aside. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=177.66s)]
*  One thing I would argue, and I don't think I'm wrong about, is that in 2022 one of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  main reasons, if not the main reason the red wave did not occur was because of the overturning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  of Roe v. Wade. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=188.76s)]
*  We had another Supreme Court decision. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=190.34s)]
*  It was unanimous today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=193.0s)]
*  It was on the abortion pill. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=194.66s)]
*  I think we're up to 60 to 70 percent of all abortions are done with that pill. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=196.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court made very clear today that that will remain legal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  The Democrats will demagogue the issue, but will this ruling impact any or mitigate any [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=207.7s)]
*  demagoguery that's going to occur this election season? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=215.34s)]
*  Well, number one, no matter what you do or say, they're going to accuse us of hating [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  women and being extremists. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  President Trump said today that the Democratic Party is extreme. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=226.34s)]
*  They support abortion up to the moment of birth. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=230.02s)]
*  The Virginia governor, the old governor, talked about allowing a decision after the baby is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=232.86s)]
*  born. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=237.94s)]
*  They're the extremists, not us. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=238.94s)]
*  I'm proud to be pro-life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=240.1s)]
*  You know, France limits abortion at 14 weeks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=241.9s)]
*  My bill's 15 weeks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  President Trump said, leave it up to the states. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=248.86s)]
*  This won't be decided based on abortion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  This election will be about your physical security, your prosperity and trying to get [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=252.86s)]
*  the world back in check before a lot of us get killed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=257.7s)]
*  I've never been more worried about an attack on our country than I am right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  And President Trump said it was a front to our nation to have Soviet ships off the coast [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=265.18s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=271.26s)]
*  Weakness breeds aggression. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  By the way, the day President Trump is elected, all this stops. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=273.82s)]
*  Nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles off the coast of my free state? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=279.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=282.86s)]
*  Of Florida? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=283.86s)]
*  And it almost seems like a Cuban missile crisis moment, but Joe doesn't know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=284.86s)]
*  Well, this is the 1930s all over again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=290.34s)]
*  Why did Russia invade Ukraine? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=293.9s)]
*  Why did Putin do it? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=295.94s)]
*  Because he thought he could get away with it on Biden's watch. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=296.94s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=299.9s)]
*  Why did they attack Israel so viciously? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=301.42s)]
*  They thought America wouldn't be with Israel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=303.82s)]
*  All that changes the day Trump wins. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=305.86s)]
*  I can't wait to have him back in office. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=308.02s)]
*  The Republican senators appreciate this man. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=310.46s)]
*  To everybody out there watching, do all you can to help President Trump, because our way [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=313.26s)]
*  of life depends on it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  It really does. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=319.02s)]
*  I say this is an inflection point for the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=321.14s)]
*  We've often said it's a tipping point election. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=324.38s)]
*  This is way bigger. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  And like you, I've never been more afraid for my country or the state of the world than [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  I am right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbmchzQn6Y&t=332.26s)]
