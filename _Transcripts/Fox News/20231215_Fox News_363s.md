# 'Dukes of Hazzard' star tackles woke culture in new movie 'Jingle Smells'
**Fox News:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA)
*  Alright, this holiday season a new Christmas comedy is out. It's called Jingle Smells. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a fun family movie. It's heartwarming and it also has an anti-woke message. Take a look. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=4.48s)]
*  You know, it's very hard to find a place that even comes close to being worthy of your beauty. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  It's romantic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=15.84s)]
*  It's about you and me alone. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=16.88s)]
*  Wow, look at the two of you! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=19.04s)]
*  Merry Christmas America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=21.68s)]
*  Hollywood has canceled Mason's Stone. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=22.96s)]
*  Stone will be digitally replaced by AI. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=25.44s)]
*  Boycott Stone! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  We will no longer be manufacturing Mason Stone characters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=29.44s)]
*  Get them all out of here by Christmas Eve! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=33.04s)]
*  You gotta be kidding me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=35.2s)]
*  How'd you get it? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=36.24s)]
*  Oh, fell off the truck. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=36.96s)]
*  There was a truck involved. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=38.56s)]
*  The mysterious gift giver has struck again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  If you get busted with those toys, you're done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=42.24s)]
*  And you made me an accessory. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, you know what they say, some accessories are required. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=45.36s)]
*  Am I smiling? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=47.84s)]
*  No. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=48.88s)]
*  Jingle Smells, Jingle Smells, stinking all the way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=49.52s)]
*  They called me Jingle Smells. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=55.92s)]
*  It's a fun movie. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=56.8s)]
*  Yes, obviously, I'm in it and one of the executive producers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, here now is one of the stars of Jingle Smells, actor John Schneider. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=60.72s)]
*  All right, you're amazing in the movie. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  I've always known you're amazing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  It was great to have the opportunity to be on this project with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=68.96s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=73.28s)]
*  It was so wonderful to be involved in a movie that the whole family could watch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  We used to do movies and television like, dare I say, Dukes of Hazzard, like Smallville, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=79.44s)]
*  where people, whether they were four years old or 94 years old, they enjoyed the same programming. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=85.28s)]
*  And that's what Jingle Smells is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=91.92s)]
*  Plus, you know, having been probably, I would say, one of the first groups to be canceled [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=93.84s)]
*  by cancel culture, you know, the Dukes of Hazzard because of the rebel flag. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=100.0s)]
*  You know, I have been an action figure that has been canceled. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=104.8s)]
*  So I love doing this movie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=109.52s)]
*  I really did. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=111.12s)]
*  Thank you for making it happen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=111.92s)]
*  So what's interesting is something for the kids, obviously, something for the parents. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=113.68s)]
*  It features Nick Gutman, who Ben Deavis does a great job playing this role. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=119.28s)]
*  He takes a job with your, how do you say it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=124.72s)]
*  Let's say off-beat garbage bin buddies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=129.52s)]
*  With what? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=133.84s)]
*  I get him a job in the sanitation department because he doesn't get a job on his own. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=134.56s)]
*  And he finds these discarded toys and gives them to children for Christmas, you know? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=140.16s)]
*  And I'm one of the founders of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=148.0s)]
*  So the fact that this movie takes place in children's hospitals really speaks well to me as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=151.6s)]
*  So because it's at the end of his workday, you know, he smells a little bit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  So the kids, like we just saw, called him Jingle Smells. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=161.76s)]
*  And I just think it's wonderful. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=165.6s)]
*  I really do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=167.76s)]
*  Folks, Jingle Smells dot movie. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=168.64s)]
*  Jingle Smells dot movie. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  If you want to get a hold of something, you want to buy a DVD. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  When you send him on this mission to destroy, you know, perfectly good toys by Christmas Eve, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=176.55999999999997s)]
*  they're pulled from the shelves based on, you know, being canceled, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=183.04s)]
*  him being canceled for his patriotic views. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=189.92s)]
*  And instead, you know, he ends up being the good guy, the Robin Hood of the movie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=192.32s)]
*  So what I love about it is parents get to see, oh, the woke world gets defeated [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=198.24s)]
*  and all in the spirit of Christmas, which I really love. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=204.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=207.84s)]
*  You know, and like on Dukes of Hazzard, the good guys get in trouble for doing the right thing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=208.88s)]
*  So this movie, I think, will speak to many, many people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=214.56s)]
*  And like I said, it's something everyone can watch at the same time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=218.88s)]
*  And it pokes a finger in the eye of the woke culture, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=223.04s)]
*  which we need to do, Sean. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=227.2s)]
*  We need to do it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=228.72s)]
*  I mean, it's it's time that we just said enough is enough. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=229.6s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=233.44s)]
*  I got to tell you, I think it's time, you know, look, there are some movies that are timeless. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  And I don't know, just just the whole notion of this and how relevant is to today's world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  It's interesting your background, your experience, what you bring to the film. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=248.0s)]
*  And there's a hero in this film. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  And I love that part of it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=253.36s)]
*  And the fact that it connects to real life, cancel culture makes me even more happy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=254.8s)]
*  My entire career, people, too, have tried to cancel me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I'm still here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=262.88s)]
*  They haven't been successful yet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=267.6s)]
*  So the truth will set you free, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  The truth will set you free. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=270.64s)]
*  So for folks who are watching this, if you're a Dukes of Hazzard fan, you're going to love it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=273.12s)]
*  If you were a Smallville fan, you know, this is kind of Dukes of Hazzard, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=276.64s)]
*  true modern day Robin Hoods, meet Jonathan Kent from Smallville. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=280.88s)]
*  So it's a great opportunity. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=285.12s)]
*  It's a wonderful time to go sit with your family, watch a movie for a change, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  where you can talk about it after. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=291.2s)]
*  It is educational, but it doesn't beat you over the head. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=293.68s)]
*  But it'll give you something to talk about with your family afterwards, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=296.64s)]
*  which I think is entertainment's job, really. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=300.32s)]
*  That's what I think entertainment is supposed to do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=303.52s)]
*  Well, you're great at it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36LBXHPwUEA&t=306.15999999999997s)]
