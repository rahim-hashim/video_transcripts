# Sean Hannity: This is a nightmare for every American family
**Fox News:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg)
*  We turn to another crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=0.0s)]
*  This one is hitting you right here at home. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=1.54s)]
*  For the third straight trading day, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=4.0s)]
*  stocks plummeting, collapsing amid fears [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=6.24s)]
*  of a global recession and rising unemployment [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=9.78s)]
*  while major industries are buckling [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=12.72s)]
*  under high interest rates. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=14.76s)]
*  The Dow was down more than a thousand points. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=16.52s)]
*  The S&P suffered its worst day [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=19.32s)]
*  since the market sell-off in 22, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=21.06s)]
*  erasing $1.4 trillion in a matter of hours. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=23.42s)]
*  This is day three of what President Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=27.74s)]
*  is now calling the Kamala crash, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=30.0s)]
*  and the hemorrhaging is not over. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  Japan's stock market, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=35.08s)]
*  they just posted their worst day [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=36.5s)]
*  since Black Monday from 1987. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=38.04s)]
*  All of this being fueled by the very real fears [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=41.28s)]
*  that the Biden-Harris economy will spiral this country [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=44.64s)]
*  into a full-on recession [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=49.06s)]
*  in spite of all the proclamations, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=50.72s)]
*  of all the success of Bidenomics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=53.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=56.22s)]
*  All that, ladies and gentlemen, and everyone else, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=58.46s)]
*  that is called Bidenomics. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  Bidenomics. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=63.96s)]
*  and we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=68.9s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  Bidenomics is working. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=75.08s)]
*  All the money Americans lost today [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=78.0s)]
*  is caused by Bidenomics. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=80.18s)]
*  So buckle up because we are in for a bumpy ride [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=82.28s)]
*  with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris of the helm, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=84.98s)]
*  and God forbid Kamala and whoever she chooses. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=88.52s)]
*  Remember, Kamala promised to eliminate the filibuster. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=91.72s)]
*  Remember she did that, said that, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  to pass the Green New Deal, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  praising AOC's 7 to 80% tax idea? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=97.96s)]
*  Why don't we just confiscate all the money? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=106.16s)]
*  So again, back to the United States Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=109.5s)]
*  If they fail to act as President of the United States, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=111.0s)]
*  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=114.8s)]
*  to pass a Green New Deal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=118.18s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's new darling of the party, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=119.44s)]
*  she officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=121.92s)]
*  She was on 60 Minutes this weekend, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=124.62s)]
*  proudly calling herself a radical, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=126.08s)]
*  and she's promoting policies like saying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=127.88s)]
*  that every single carbon emission in the country, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=129.88s)]
*  every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=131.62s)]
*  everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=134.46s)]
*  Do you agree that she could possibly, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=137.36s)]
*  in this ideology of the socialist left, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=138.86s)]
*  could splinter your party? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=141.06s)]
*  No, you know, I think that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=142.72s)]
*  she is challenging the status quo. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=146.06s)]
*  I think that's fantastic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=148.76s)]
*  I think that she is introducing bold ideas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=150.42s)]
*  that should be discussed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=153.6s)]
*  Green New Deal's fantastic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=157.04s)]
*  We need to discuss it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=158.54s)]
*  Remember, everything is gonna be free [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  under the Green New Deal, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  free government housing for all, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=162.7s)]
*  free childcare, free government healthcare, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=164.28s)]
*  free food, free college, a guaranteed government job, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  government assistance from cradle to grave [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  at over $90 trillion, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=173.58s)]
*  which is 15 times more than the entire yearly federal budget. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  It'll live within that anyway. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, an income tax hike, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=183.12s)]
*  that's not gonna cover it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Remember, she in 2019, in her own words, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=186.72s)]
*  promised to raise taxes on corporations and individuals [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  and the death tax on the evil rich too. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=196.3s)]
*  So these are some of the ways, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  we've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1%. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=201.86s)]
*  And that part of that is gonna be about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  repealing that tax bill that they just passed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes are gonna have to go up [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=209.84s)]
*  for the richest Americans. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=212.44s)]
*  It was only six days ago, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=215.08s)]
*  only two days before this market crash began, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=216.58s)]
*  that Biden was out there bragging [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  that he and Kamala Harris, they'd cured the economy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  We just didn't know it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=226.12s)]
*  And then the crash, take a look. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=227.78s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you want your legacy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  for Jim Beasley to be? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=232.42s)]
*  You guys, cured the economy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=233.92s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=238.66s)]
*  And the environment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=239.5s)]
*  And a few other small things. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=241.06s)]
*  Somebody needs to cure him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=243.56s)]
*  Now that statement was laughable then, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  and it's really not laughable for the trillion plus lost [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=247.04s)]
*  in the last couple of days. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  Then, and even more so now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=252.94s)]
*  Here are the facts put together by economist Steve Moore. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=256.2s)]
*  Well before today's market sell off and this latest crash, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=259.3s)]
*  first up, America's real income adjusted for inflation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=263.54s)]
*  was up more than $4,000 under President Trump. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=267.52s)]
*  It's down by more than 2,000 under Biden-Harris. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=270.38s)]
*  Now next, until recently, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=273.12s)]
*  job growth has been relatively strong in the US, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=274.68s)]
*  but those were COVID jobs coming back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=277.42s)]
*  And the other jobs were created by the government, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=279.76s)]
*  paid for by one of the Biden-Harris administration's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=283.06s)]
*  massive spending bills that caused inflation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=289.12s)]
*  And speaking of inflation, you can see it right here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=292.56s)]
*  That inflation was almost non-existent [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=294.06s)]
*  during Donald Trump's four years. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  What he left off is 1.4% under Biden and Harris. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=298.6s)]
*  A much different story with prices now up [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=303.06s)]
*  by more than 20 plus percent overall. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  This is a nightmare for all of you, every American family. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  Look at your screen, auto insurance up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=314.18s)]
*  51%, gas up 40 plus percent, eating out up 22%, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=317.0s)]
*  if you can afford it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=321.0s)]
*  Airfare up 22%, housing up 21%, meat, I love meat, 21%. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=322.24s)]
*  Used cars up 18%, new cars, 17%. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=328.44s)]
*  Daycare, preschool up 16%. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=334.12s)]
*  Real wages are down. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=336.76s)]
*  The price of literally everything you buy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  in every store you go to is up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  So of course, credit card debt is also on the rise, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=342.32s)]
*  up by more than $240 billion since Joe Biden [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  and Kamala Harris got into office. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=350.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, mortgage payments. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=352.46s)]
*  You know, didn't you like your 2.9% [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=354.0s)]
*  30 year fixed rate mortgage? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, they've more than doubled under Biden and Harris. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=358.76s)]
*  Vast new regulations imposed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  by the Biden-Harris administration are also taking a toll, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=363.76s)]
*  costing an estimated $47,000 per family. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  This is a horrendous economic track record, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  make no mistake, Kamala Harris owns this record, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  wants to go further to the left of Joe Biden, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=377.56s)]
*  and here's the receipt for the new tax bill [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=380.44s)]
*  she would like to impose on you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=383.0s)]
*  She would like to raise the corporate tax. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=385.16s)]
*  She wants to, you know, of course that gets passed on to you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  Corporations do not pay taxes, I say it all the time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  And she also wants to raise the individual taxes of people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  She wants to raise the estate taxes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=399.12s)]
*  She wants to raise taxes on small business [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  by more than eight points. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=404.04s)]
*  She wants to almost double the capital gains tax. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=404.92s)]
*  I mean, how much more can people pay? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=407.8s)]
*  And she, by the way, apparently even supports a crazy tax [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=410.12s)]
*  on what they call unrealized gains. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=414.08s)]
*  In other words, if you own a stock or property [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=416.04s)]
*  that you may own and it goes up on paper, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=419.32s)]
*  or your 401k goes up on paper, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=422.52s)]
*  she wants you to fork over 40% of what the paper gain is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=425.36s)]
*  But if you have a sell-off, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=430.24s)]
*  it's like we've had the last three days, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  whatever gain you had is gone [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  and you just paid taxes on money you're never gonna see. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=435.18s)]
*  Even if you realize the profits through a sale, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  you never realize them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't stop there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=442.6s)]
*  Kamala is now proposing what is the largest redistribution [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=443.70000000000005s)]
*  of wealth in the history of the world. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=447.42s)]
*  This is what Marxism is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=449.62s)]
*  To each according to their need. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  From each according to their ability. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=453.48s)]
*  Well, that's kind of what she's preaching. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  She is beyond radical. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  This is beyond extreme. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=461.1s)]
*  This is downright dangerous. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=462.86s)]
*  Her domestic policy, economic policy, immigration policy, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=464.86s)]
*  foreign policy, energy policy, law and order, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=468.46s)]
*  which we've gone through in detail, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=471.58s)]
*  all of it, dangerous, radical and extreme. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=473.3s)]
*  This is all brought to you by somebody [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=476.86s)]
*  who doesn't even seem to understand [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=478.66s)]
*  the basics of the economy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=480.4s)]
*  For example, listen to Kamala off script [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=482.18s)]
*  talking about her plan to fix inflation, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=484.66s)]
*  which by the way was only supposed to be transitory. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=487.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=490.1s)]
*  Well, let's start with this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=491.42s)]
*  Prices have gone up. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=496.54s)]
*  And families and individuals are dealing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=499.7s)]
*  with the realities of that bread costs more, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=504.7s)]
*  the gas costs more. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=509.42s)]
*  And we have to understand what that means. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=511.58s)]
*  That's about the cost of living going up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=514.18s)]
*  That's about having to stress and stretch [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=517.3s)]
*  limited resources. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=520.8s)]
*  That's about a source of stress for families [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=522.5999999999999s)]
*  that is not only economic, but is on a daily level, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=525.0999999999999s)]
*  something that is a heavy weight to carry. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=529.4s)]
*  And we know from the history of this issue [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=531.5s)]
*  in the United States that when you see these prices go up, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=533.28s)]
*  it has a direct impact on the quality of life [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=537.4s)]
*  for all people in our country. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=540.4799999999999s)]
*  For comparison, here is the Make America Great Again pack [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=543.8s)]
*  describing inflation in less than 10 seconds. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=547.52s)]
*  Here's a quick education for Kamala Harris. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=551.52s)]
*  I prefer to do self-checkout [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=553.96s)]
*  because I speed through the grocery store. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=566.24s)]
*  People say, what are you doing here? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=568.64s)]
*  Buying food, I like to eat. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=570.52s)]
*  Anyway, the Biden-Harris administration [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=572.08s)]
*  is now trying to spend their way out of inflation. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=573.76s)]
*  They've been telling us that it's transitory [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=576.6s)]
*  for almost four years now. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=578.68s)]
*  And she believes that only she and Joe [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  know how to better spend your money than you do. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  And don't forget, Kamala is an expert in all things, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=585.2399999999999s)]
*  even technology. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  You didn't know this, but she is. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=589.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  So, given where we are now, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  so you're no longer, are you necessarily keeping [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  those private files in some file cabinet [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=598.54s)]
*  that's locked in the basement of the house? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=601.92s)]
*  It's on your laptop, and it's then therefore [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  up here in this cloud that exists above us, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=609.16s)]
*  It's no longer in a physical place. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=614.6s)]
*  The cloud above us, it's like Joe shaking hands with air. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  We are not in good hands. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=623.8s)]
*  This is a very scary time. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=625.28s)]
*  This is a dangerous time. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=627.5s)]
*  These are extreme policies. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  They are radical, they are dangerous. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  But in the coming weeks, 2024, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=634.44s)]
*  that election will come down to five issues. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  It's gonna come down to their open border policies, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=638.8800000000001s)]
*  their horrible economy, their disastrous foreign policy, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=641.44s)]
*  law and order and safety and security [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=645.6s)]
*  in every small town and big city, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  energy independence, which we can achieve, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=651.1s)]
*  and then energy dominance. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=653.48s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has been an abject failure. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  She's not up to the job by any means on all of these issues. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=658.2600000000001s)]
*  That is her record. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=662.46s)]
*  She owns that, that defines her, that is who she is. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=663.52s)]
*  But unfortunately, no one in the state run media mob [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=667.24s)]
*  wants to hold her accountable for anything. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=669.68s)]
*  Like Biden, Kamala is hiding behind a teleprompter [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=671.48s)]
*  during what are heavily scripted events [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=674.24s)]
*  featuring platitudes, generalizations, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=676.4s)]
*  and attacks on Donald Trump 24 seven. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=679.0s)]
*  But, you know, never anything deep, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=681.72s)]
*  never anything substantial. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=684.06s)]
*  You know, for a deeply unpopular politician [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=685.96s)]
*  anointed by party leaders without a single primary vote, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=688.28s)]
*  don't you deserve better? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=691.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris, you know, has she ever been forced [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=694.76s)]
*  to answer a tough question? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=697.84s)]
*  Is democracy, is the media that dead? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=699.8s)]
*  I guess they are. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrpN7CtOJg&t=703.16s)]
