# Trump White House's 'firsts' deflate John Leguizamo's 'racist' charges
**Fox News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ)
*  Here now with more Tudor Dixon podcast host Tudor Dixon and Outkick founder Clay Travis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you both for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=7.48s)]
*  All right, Tudor, I got to start with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=8.88s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell moving out of the country, moving to Ireland, writing poetry about Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=11.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=16.4s)]
*  Well, you might not know this, but I actually worked for Rosie O'Donnell once upon a time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So 26 years ago, I was an intern at the Rosie O'Donnell show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=22.56s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=26.96s)]
*  And it was a totally well, the Rosie O'Donnell that I knew was obviously a different Rosie [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=28.2s)]
*  O'Donnell than today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=32.44s)]
*  People absolutely adored her. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  They loved working on her show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=35.64s)]
*  I don't know what happened, but I will give her credit that she didn't like it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=36.88s)]
*  She said she was going to leave. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Every other celebrity says they're going to leave and they just stay in the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=42.74s)]
*  So she left and she's saying all of the stuff. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=46.08s)]
*  The one thing I would say is Rosie, don't look at our party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=50.2s)]
*  Look at your party. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=54.08s)]
*  If you're so unhappy, ask yourself why your party is so screwed up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=55.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you bring up a good point, Tudor, because Clay, at least she did what [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  she said she was going to do, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=66.16s)]
*  Ellen DeGeneres said she was going to do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  She actually moved out, but all these other ones did say, oh, I got to leave the country [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  and then they don't. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=73.08s)]
*  So yeah, I'll give her some credit there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=74.92s)]
*  I don't wish any ill will on any person, on any American. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=76.28s)]
*  If she's happier there, I'm glad she went. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=80.24s)]
*  I actually feel sorry for Ireland because of all the celebrities that said they were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=84.64s)]
*  going to leave. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=89.44s)]
*  Don't you think they're actually disappointed that they got Rosie O'Donnell? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=90.44s)]
*  I mean, she's like 78 on the list of celebrities that you'd want if you're Irish to move to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=93.64s)]
*  your country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=99.32s)]
*  No Americans care. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=100.32s)]
*  And by the way, Tudor Dixon, we need you to run in Michigan and help win back that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=101.32s)]
*  state either as governor or senator. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=107.4s)]
*  She's got a great podcast in the Clay and Buck podcast network. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=110.76s)]
*  We would hate to lose her like we lost Sean Parnell, but she would dominate in Michigan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=113.84s)]
*  She would win statewide as either a senator or a governor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=118.84s)]
*  Maybe Rosie would move back since she used to be an intern. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=122.56s)]
*  Maybe she'd be comfortable in Michigan with Tudor in control there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=125.56s)]
*  Michigan is a lovely, I do encourage people to move to the state of Michigan. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=128.32s)]
*  I'll take Rosie. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=134.08s)]
*  I'll take anybody. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=135.08s)]
*  You know, come on, come. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=136.08s)]
*  We are friendly here in Michigan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=137.7s)]
*  That's pretty friendly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=141.68s)]
*  That's going to the extra mile to be friendly with that one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=143.18s)]
*  But listen, look, you got John Legasamo. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=145.78s)]
*  He was a decent actor, or at least he used to be. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=149.38s)]
*  And he, but he says out there saying, oh, Trump is racist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=152.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=156.3s)]
*  Maybe Cash Patel might have something to say about that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=157.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=159.78s)]
*  Maybe Tulsi Gabbard might take issue with that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=160.78s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=162.74s)]
*  What's your take on Donald Trump, the racist? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=164.22s)]
*  I mean, that's such an old, tired trope that they throw out there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=167.06s)]
*  It just doesn't hold water. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=170.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=173.1s)]
*  I mean, if you look at this, you've got Marco Rubio. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=174.1s)]
*  Like you said, you have Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=179.14s)]
*  But also this idea that it's the white men's club. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=180.9s)]
*  I mean, you have the first female chief of staff in Suzy Weill's, an amazing woman. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=183.9s)]
*  She has done incredible things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=188.6s)]
*  Everybody is praising her all across the nation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=190.3s)]
*  How dare he say this about Donald Trump's White House? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=192.86s)]
*  Open your eyes, people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=196.18s)]
*  This is why you have a 27% approval rating, because people are looking at this White House [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=197.18s)]
*  and saying it has more firsts than any others. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you've got women, you've got gay, you've got black, you've got Latino. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=204.74s)]
*  Stop saying this about this White House. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=210.02s)]
*  They're not hiring for race. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  They're hiring for quality, and they've got great quality people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's hiring the best people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=217.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think the thing you have to hammer home. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=219.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I think you have to hammer home here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=223.18s)]
*  It hasn't gotten enough attention. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=227.1s)]
*  Donald Trump won the least racially divisive election victory in 2024 since 1964. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=228.61999999999998s)]
*  That is white, black, Asian, Hispanic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=238.78s)]
*  We have never voted closer together than we did for Donald Trump in 2024. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=241.04s)]
*  Remember, interestingly, the only group that Kamala Harris gained support by was actually [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  white voters a little bit, but black Asian Hispanic voters overwhelmingly came to Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=251.28s)]
*  Let me give a shout out right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=256.62s)]
*  I'm up near Bedminster where President Trump is. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=258.14s)]
*  Caroline Levitt is bringing in all sorts of new media. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=261.62s)]
*  I am one of them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=264.86s)]
*  I am up here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=266.18s)]
*  I'm going to be with Donald Trump tomorrow with the president and several other people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=267.18s)]
*  to watch the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=270.82s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=274.62s)]
*  The Penn State wrestling team endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=275.62s)]
*  Good for those guys. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=278.46s)]
*  In October of 2024, right before the election in the swing state of Pennsylvania, also Tudor [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=279.7s)]
*  swing state of Michigan, they won as well, but it should be an electric atmosphere. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=285.5s)]
*  Trump's been cheered at the Daytona 500 at the Super Bowl. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  I bet he gets a phenomenal reception in Philadelphia at that wrestling championship tomorrow. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=294.34s)]
*  I can't wait to check it out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=299.9s)]
*  Yeah, I know some of the best wrestlers in the world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=301.46s)]
*  I don't know if we ever had a president go to such a wrestling match, but good on him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=305.38s)]
*  Great question. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=311.14s)]
*  Glad that he's bringing you along. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=312.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he has. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=313.38s)]
*  Penn State, Iowa State, I mean, there's some really good teams out there and wrestlers [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  that are off the charts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=319.82s)]
*  And look, this is the magic of Donald Trump that the Democrats never figure out. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=321.14s)]
*  They never figure out that the idea that, guess what? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=325.46s)]
*  He just goes and does things that real people actually do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=328.2s)]
*  And they don't try to pretend, you know, go on the view and tell people they're racist. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=332.05999999999995s)]
*  That's just doesn't move the meter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=336.4s)]
*  Tudor, what last thought to you? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=338.73999999999995s)]
*  Last thought to you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=340.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  When you're watching this, everything on their side is very scripted. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  They've been used to having messages that they then send to the media. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=346.1s)]
*  The media spreads that message. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  They feel like their voices are being heard all across the nation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=351.56s)]
*  But now everybody's turned on the media. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  They've turned on their messaging. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=357.42s)]
*  And it's all fake. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=359.26s)]
*  It's all acted out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=360.26s)]
*  I mean, they've got these stupid videos. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=361.26s)]
*  You got the fighter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  Who's your fighter? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  It all feels very scripted. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=364.82s)]
*  And the American people are done with scripted. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is like the least scripted man on the planet. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=368.62s)]
*  And people love that about him because they think he is real. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=371.62s)]
*  They know he's real. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJwMaOucaBQ&t=375.09999999999997s)]
