# Leavitt: Zelenskyy was 'ungrateful' to the American taxpayer
**Fox News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI)
*  All right, President Trump, he has been in office for only six weeks, but he continues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=0.0s)]
*  to rack up win after win after win, adding two more major victories today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=6.68s)]
*  According to a Reuters report, Honda will now produce the next Civic in Indiana instead [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=10.8s)]
*  of Mexico over the issue of Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=16.7s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=20.04s)]
*  And earlier today, President Trump announced a $100 billion investment in the U.S. from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=21.04s)]
*  a Taiwanese semiconductor chip giant called TSMC, this on the heels of Nissan deciding [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=27.38s)]
*  to build their plant in the U.S. instead of the original plant in Mexico, and of course, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=33.9s)]
*  Apple's $500 billion four-year commitment to build a massive plant in Texas that will [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=38.58s)]
*  create tens and tens of thousands of high-paying jobs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is set to deliver his address to Congress tomorrow night. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=48.06s)]
*  The theme of which Fox News has now learned will be the renewal of the American dream [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=52.46s)]
*  here now with our Hannity Washington briefing, our very own White House press secretary, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=58.38s)]
*  Caroline Levy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=65.58s)]
*  How are you? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=66.58s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=67.58s)]
*  It's great to see you in person, Sean. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=68.58s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=69.58s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=70.58s)]
*  The only good reason to be to the swamp is to see you, JD, and Pam. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=71.58s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=73.9s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=74.9s)]
*  And the president, when I do get to see him as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=75.9s)]
*  This is major news. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  I know everyone wants to talk about tariffs, bad, bad, bad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=80.9s)]
*  No, why don't people understand the president is a never-ending negotiator? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=82.94000000000001s)]
*  He's a never-ending negotiator. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=87.5s)]
*  It's the art of the deal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=89.22s)]
*  But also, the president has proven, as he did in his first terms, that tariffs can bring [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  good-paying jobs back here to the United States of America. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=95.34s)]
*  They protect critical industries here at home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=98.7s)]
*  And President Trump is serious when he says he wants to make America the manufacturing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=101.54s)]
*  superpower of the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=105.5s)]
*  And we have the ability to do it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=107.34s)]
*  We have the best resources and the best people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, we've been ruled by a political class that has sold us out for far too long. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=111.86s)]
*  And we've allowed other nations around the world to rip us off. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  So your audience should be aware that tonight, 12 a.m., tariffs on Mexico and China are going [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=119.38s)]
*  into effect, and another 10 percent on China, 25 percent on Mexico, 25 percent on Canada. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=125.18s)]
*  And the reason is because we cannot continue to allow fentanyl to pour into our country [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  and kill our people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=137.82s)]
*  I bet you every single person watching your show tonight knows somebody who has died at [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=139.26s)]
*  the hands of Chinese fentanyl that has come through our northern or southern border. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=143.66s)]
*  And one American life is one too many. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=148.7s)]
*  And these tariffs are necessary to continue to put the pressure on these countries to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=151.34s)]
*  secure our borders. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=155.22s)]
*  Did you see this as a big movement by Mexico to allow us to, by handing over some of these [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=156.22s)]
*  cartel leaders? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=163.34s)]
*  Is that their way of saying, please don't put the tariffs on us? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=164.58s)]
*  And the president's saying, no, you got to do everything I want. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=167.78s)]
*  We have certainly seen an increase of cooperation from Mexico and also from Canada. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=169.94s)]
*  But over the past four years, under the previous administration, they allowed thousands of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=175.58s)]
*  pounds of Chinese-produced fentanyl into our country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Last year alone, through the southern border, 4.8 billion people could have died for the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=185.3s)]
*  amount of fentanyl that came through our borders. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=190.86s)]
*  At the northern border, there was enough fentanyl to kill 9.8 million people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=192.86s)]
*  That's up 2,050% since 2023, the year prior. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=197.34s)]
*  2,050% increase. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=201.82s)]
*  These countries have to be held accountable for that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=204.34s)]
*  Fentanyl is the leading cause of death in this country from ages 18 to 34. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=207.1s)]
*  And if you talk to the families and the parents who have lost their children at the hands [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=210.9s)]
*  of this deadly poison, they will tell you they are grateful for the president finally [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=215.3s)]
*  taking strong action to end this epidemic and this crisis in our country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=219.34s)]
*  You were in the room when President Zelensky was there on Friday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=223.26s)]
*  What was your take? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=226.42s)]
*  It was my take that President Zelensky, unfortunately, was ungrateful to the American taxpayer. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=228.74s)]
*  And frankly, putting aside my job as President Trump's spokeswoman, as an American citizen, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=234.46s)]
*  it was incredibly profound to watch our president actually stand up for us, for the taxpaying [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  American law-abiding citizen who is sick and tired of seeing hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  go out the door every single year when we have real problems in our country here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=252.1s)]
*  And President Trump wants to end this war. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=256.94s)]
*  He campaigned on this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  He talked about it at every single rally across the country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=260.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, President Zelensky is not in the mindset to negotiate peace. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=263.98s)]
*  And I think, frankly, it was incredibly refreshing to watch the president and the vice president [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=268.64s)]
*  stand up for America and to have that be before the world to see. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=273.12s)]
*  The world was able to finally watch what President Trump and his team have been dealing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=278.02s)]
*  with behind closed doors, which is a hardheadedness, unfortunately, from President Zelensky and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=283.14s)]
*  the Ukrainians in negotiating a true peace deal with Russia. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  You're the youngest White House press secretary in history. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=291.58s)]
*  I am. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=294.78s)]
*  I watch you mostly without any notes at all. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=295.78s)]
*  And the ease with which you deal with some people that we both know are pretty hostile [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=299.34s)]
*  towards President Trump. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=304.94s)]
*  And you do it with a smile and ease. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  Were you always that at ease with public speaking, which happens to be most people's number one [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=310.5s)]
*  fear? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=315.78s)]
*  Well, I do think God gives everybody unique gifts and skills. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=316.78s)]
*  And I guess public speaking is one of mine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=320.9s)]
*  You gave me a big mouth. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  But I do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  I do work for a great boss who makes my job quite easy because he says something and he [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  does it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=329.82s)]
*  So there's no spin. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=330.82s)]
*  It's all truth. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=332.06s)]
*  We have the facts on our side. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=333.06s)]
*  In explaining these tariffs, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=334.66s)]
*  Most people would run away from that argument. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=336.62s)]
*  But we have the truth and the statistics and the facts on our side. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=338.5s)]
*  And everything the president does is backed by— [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=342.62s)]
*  They're putting tariffs on us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=344.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=345.62s)]
*  What's right for the American public? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=346.62s)]
*  The president, it seems like, almost on a daily basis, is giving more access in six [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=348.18s)]
*  weeks than Joe Biden has given in four years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=353.7s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=355.98s)]
*  I mean, is there any level of appreciation from the media? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=356.98s)]
*  Do they not now know that they were shut out? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=360.74s)]
*  They'll tell you off the record if you talk to them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  Off the record. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=364.86s)]
*  They may not admit it on television because it doesn't fit their brand. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=365.86s)]
*  Oh, I want to know what they tell you off the record. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=368.42s)]
*  You don't have to mention names. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=370.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=371.3s)]
*  They'll tell you off the record that they greatly appreciate the access that they have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=372.3s)]
*  been given to the president of the United States. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=375.62s)]
*  They are able to ask him questions every single day on an array of topics, whatever is on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=378.22s)]
*  their mind. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=383.5s)]
*  Even today, the president announced a major investment in America, $100 billion from a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=384.5s)]
*  Taiwanese chip company. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  You just mentioned it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=391.06s)]
*  More jobs coming back home. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=392.3s)]
*  And then he opened it up to questions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  He took questions on the announcement today, but he also took questions on the news of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=395.3s)]
*  the day, on Ukraine and on tariffs and other topics as well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=398.46s)]
*  Just like, unlike Joe, who's, uh, let me call on AP and four questions. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsgPCRI5tVI&t=402.02s)]
