# Many believe this is ‘wrong’: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo)
*  Here now with reaction is Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, we expected this appeal. I have the writ of cert for the Supreme Court [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=4.0s)]
*  right here in front of me. And many of the bases you and I discussed are the arguments of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=8.8s)]
*  Republican Party. They say section three of the 14th Amendment is not self-executing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=13.36s)]
*  and they say that President Trump, as a president, does not fall under the text [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=17.84s)]
*  of this amendment. What do you think? Well, it's a very strong appeal. It's, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=22.64s)]
*  frankly, the moment that many of us have been waiting for. For months, this dangerous theory [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=27.68s)]
*  has been replicated throughout the country as challengers try to find a judge or a court [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=33.12s)]
*  that will give credence to this theory. Many of us believe that it's fundamentally wrong from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=41.04s)]
*  historical and the legal perspective, but they finally found four justices in Colorado that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=47.28s)]
*  were willing to do this. Now, that court had seven democratically appointed justices, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=54.08s)]
*  and three of them refused to sign on with this and said that it was clearly wrong, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  but they were able to eke out a 4-3 win in Colorado. That is now an outlier. You have the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Michigan Supreme Court following other courts and refusing to disqualify the former president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=72.16s)]
*  It is ripe for the Supreme Court to review. There's a conflict among the states, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=80.0s)]
*  and there's a very weighty issue here, obviously, for the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=85.2s)]
*  It is. You look over at Michigan. One of the big victories there, and you pointed this out on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  Twitter, now known as X, that Democrats actually helped to stop Trump from being removed from the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=97.92s)]
*  ballot. These are judges, justices appointed by Democrats. Right, and I think that's important to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=104.64s)]
*  remind people because in this age of rage, we often make assumptions about people that we don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=112.56s)]
*  agree with. It's important to note that this theory has been rejected in various states [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=119.52s)]
*  by democratic judges, judges appointed by democratic governors or judges that are, in fact, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=125.84s)]
*  Democrats who ran for office. They showed that they could resist temptation, that they have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=132.88s)]
*  greater fealty to the Constitution than they do their own views and own political preferences. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=139.44s)]
*  The question now is, will the Supreme Court intervene? I believe it will. What's interesting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=148.88s)]
*  about this filing is it doesn't raise the right to free speech, and it does not raise [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=155.12s)]
*  the factual determination that this was an insurrection. That will be raised, presumably, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=160.8s)]
*  in later appeals, but instead they're focusing on the threshold issues of the removal of this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=168.08s)]
*  name from the ballot. I think it's a very strong appeal. Professor Turley, I have just a moment [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=174.24s)]
*  here, but should the Supreme Court take this and rule on this? Is this the biggest case [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=180.8s)]
*  pertaining to a presidential election since Bush v. Gore? Yes, and it's a very important [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=184.96s)]
*  point to raise. Bush v. Gore was destructive for the court in many respects. Many of the justices [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=192.16s)]
*  spent years trying to repair the divisions on the court itself. I think that the chief justice is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  going to try to get an unanimous decision here. I hope that it can speak with one voice, and that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=204.08s)]
*  voice should be to reject Colorado's decision and to protect our democratic values, to show [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=209.92s)]
*  the public that the court itself is divided ideologically, but they remain unified on these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=215.6s)]
*  basic values that define us. It would be a great day for democracy indeed if it were 9-0. Professor [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBfcvCncyo&t=222.23999999999998s)]
