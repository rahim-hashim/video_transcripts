# Sen. John Kennedy ridicules Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 'goofy' ideas
**Fox News:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU)
*  All right, the Green New Deal, climate alarmists, religious cult, they strike again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=0.0s)]
*  This time, California Governor Gavin Newsom, our old friend, he's threatening to intervene [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=4.04s)]
*  if Donald Trump kills the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=9.16s)]
*  All right, now Donald Trump is expected to eliminate the credit, which was pushed by [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=13.84s)]
*  the Biden administration and the radical left as part of his plan to stop the attack on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=19.2s)]
*  gas-powered vehicles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction, he's probably one of our favorite senators of all time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=25.28s)]
*  Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=29.64s)]
*  Senator, great to have you back. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=32.56s)]
*  Well, there's a new sheriff in town and, you know, we actually believe in liberty and freedom [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=34.04s)]
*  and limited government, Senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=39.6s)]
*  And if people want a gas-powered vehicle, I think they should be allowed to have one. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  I have no problem if they want to buy a Tesla. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=45.88s)]
*  And I don't think they should force Ford to lose $4.5 billion a year producing cars that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  their customers don't want. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=53.84s)]
*  Well, Sean, I don't hate anyone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=56.72s)]
*  And Governor Newsom is entitled to his opinion. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=60.96s)]
*  But in my judgment, he's a featherweight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=63.56s)]
*  If you scratch the surface, you just get more surface. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=67.84s)]
*  I've met dozens of folks like him, hundreds in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=71.8s)]
*  They're superficial. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=78.36s)]
*  They're the kind of people that would have a picture of the backstreet boys tattooed on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=79.6s)]
*  their lower back. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=85.08s)]
*  Now, the Democratic elites, the woke Democratic elites with their organic broccoli and their [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=86.88s)]
*  NPR tote bags love him because he does what he's told. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=96.44s)]
*  But his ideas are goofy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=101.68s)]
*  Take the electric vehicles. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=103.44s)]
*  Governor Newsom and others convinced President Biden and Vice President Harris to use billions [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=105.64s)]
*  of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and dozens of government mandates to force our automobile [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=111.84s)]
*  manufacturers to make electric cars. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=118.8s)]
*  But the American people won't buy them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=122.08s)]
*  So the car manufacturers have said thousands of jobs and they're going broke. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=125.48s)]
*  It's higher degree stupid. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=130.8s)]
*  If you want to if somebody wants a Tesla and I have friends that own Tesla, they love it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=135.08s)]
*  But Tesla is in that business. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=141.32s)]
*  And but when you force companies to build cars that their customers don't want like Ford, they lost [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=143.48s)]
*  four and a half billion dollars. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=151.48s)]
*  That takes away high paying career jobs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=152.56s)]
*  OK. Number two, why are we subsidizing one industry over the other industry except that they [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=154.52s)]
*  want to push their refrigerator agenda, gas stove agenda? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=162.28s)]
*  Is there anything we can't have choice on anymore? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=166.24s)]
*  But, you know, I don't want a paper straw like a plastic straw. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=169.52s)]
*  Look, government does not know better than private markets. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=175.24s)]
*  Governor Newsom does not know better than private markets. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=179.24s)]
*  Joe Biden does not know better than private markets. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=183.0s)]
*  We need to get rid of the mandates. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  We need to get rid of the subsidies, go back to a consumer driven driven free enterprise system. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=188.24s)]
*  But but that's the way the neo-socialists, neo-socialists who've been in charge for years think [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=196.2s)]
*  they say they believe in free enterprise, but they try to use mandates and subsidies and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  redistribution and regulations to control the private market, leave the free markets alone. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=208.88s)]
*  The American people are they're saying most of them are saying and decent and and very capable of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=215.0s)]
*  making their own decisions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=223.36s)]
*  And when when electric vehicles, when they solve the range anxiety problem, when they lower [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=225.24s)]
*  the cost, the American people have taken a look. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  But they can't be forced to do this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=234.84s)]
*  All Biden and Newsom accomplished was to to have thousands of people laid off and our car [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  manufacturers just about to go broke. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  That's all they accomplished. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, look, if Gavin wants to spend Californians money, let him do it in California, but don't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  force the rest of the country to subsidize his radical agenda. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=253.0s)]
*  So we went through an election, Senator, where their closing argument is that if you like [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=256.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, you're garbage. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=262.44s)]
*  He's a fascist, a racist and a Nazi. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=264.56s)]
*  That was their closing argument. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=267.2s)]
*  And I noticed a lot of the Hollywood elite. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=268.88s)]
*  I'd be negligent if I didn't ask you about this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=271.68s)]
*  You know, Alec Baldwin calling the American people deliberately ignorant. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=274.4s)]
*  Sharon Stone saying that Americans are ignorant, arrogant and adolescent. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=279.12s)]
*  You have a New York state legislator that wants, let's see, New York to secede from the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=284.6s)]
*  union along with Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=291.0s)]
*  What is your reaction to all that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=295.8s)]
*  I think you're going to have a very unique take. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=297.32s)]
*  Here's what I think. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=303.04s)]
*  I think these people are goofy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=304.32s)]
*  They have the right to their opinion, but they're just goofy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=306.96s)]
*  They they hate George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln and Dr. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=310.64s)]
*  Zeus and Mr. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Potato Head. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=318.08s)]
*  They think our kids ought to be able to change change genders at recess. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=319.64s)]
*  They carry around Ziploc bags of kale to give themselves energy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=326.68s)]
*  To me, to each his own. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=332.88s)]
*  To me, kale tastes like I'd rather be fat. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=334.32s)]
*  Now, these people are entitled to their opinion, but they have an unwarranted sense of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=337.44s)]
*  moral and intellectual superiority. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=342.92s)]
*  They think they're smarter than and more virtuous than the American people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=346.52s)]
*  And they think we're not real people, but we were and we are real people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=351.6s)]
*  And in this lax election, we got real mad and we sent a message clearly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=356.92s)]
*  unequivocally. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  And my message to all my my my my friends and my enemies in America is happy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanksgiving and stay deplorable, my friend. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=372.96s)]
*  But they are a bunch of pompous ass. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  They are arrogant, elitist, and they really do look down on the people that make this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=380.4s)]
*  country great. And they're out of touch. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=385.96s)]
*  Well, they're entitled. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=388.52s)]
*  Sean, they're they're entitled to their opinion, but we're entitled to ours. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=389.56s)]
*  And when we share our opinion, they not only think we're wrong, but we're bad people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=394.92s)]
*  And that's not an America we want. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=399.96s)]
*  Senator, I have one last question. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=403.32s)]
*  Do you like come up with these? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=404.76s)]
*  Is this all extemporaneous when you answer or do you think about it ahead of time? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  Because it's too good to think that it just comes off the top of your head. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=410.44s)]
*  Sean, this is how the good Lord made me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=414.28s)]
*  I have the right to remain silent, but not the ability. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know whether it's it's divine inspiration or the devil's making me do it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=422.08s)]
*  But that's it just comes out on me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, don't ever stop, Senator. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=432.88s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPr9rH2gNoU&t=435.15999999999997s)]
