# Hannity: No one in the media mob has peddled more lies than Rachel Maddow
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k)
*  But first, the all-important Iowa caucuses, they are in the books. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a huge night for Donald Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=3.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  I really think this is time now for everybody, our country, to come together. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  We want to come together, whether it's Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=12.98s)]
*  It would be so nice if we could come together and straighten out the world and straighten [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=18.64s)]
*  out the problems and straighten out all of the death and destruction that we're witnessing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=23.48s)]
*  that's practically never been like this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=28.12s)]
*  It's just so important, and I want to make that a very big part of our message. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=30.680000000000003s)]
*  We're going to come together. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=34.36s)]
*  It's going to happen soon, too. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=35.36s)]
*  It's going to happen soon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=36.84s)]
*  The 45th president won the state with a historic 30-point margin, getting most votes of 98 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  out of 99 Iowa counties. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=46.36s)]
*  The previous record of a win was set by Bob Dole in 1988, who won by just shy of 13 points. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=49.2s)]
*  And as you just heard during his victory speech, Donald Trump struck what was a unifying tone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=56.92s)]
*  But apparently, according to part-time make-believe journalists and full-time left-wing hate-Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=63.28s)]
*  conspiracy theorists like radical Rachel Maddow, Trump's speech was too dangerous for the fragile [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=68.44s)]
*  ears of NBC's loyal viewers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=75.64s)]
*  They didn't take any of the speech live. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=78.08s)]
*  Instead, no, Ms. Maddow was lecturing Americans about truth and integrity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  This is a joke, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  Serious question. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=87.68s)]
*  Does Maddow not have any self-awareness at all? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=88.68s)]
*  No one in the media mob has peddled more lies, more conspiracy theories than Rachel Maddow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=92.48s)]
*  Every night for about five solid years, and it still goes on to this day, Maddow proudly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=98.68s)]
*  donned that tinfoil hat and spread some of the most insane, craziest conspiracy theories [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=104.04s)]
*  that we've ever heard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=110.28s)]
*  Now, she denied the legitimacy of the 2016 election, an election denier. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=111.48s)]
*  Anyway, telling her viewers that it was hacked by Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=115.76s)]
*  She also suggested that Russia was in charge of our federal government and that Donald [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=119.6s)]
*  Trump was a Russian agent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=123.96s)]
*  Quote, the worst-case scenario that the president is a foreign agent suddenly feels very palpable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=125.84s)]
*  Night after night, Maddow and others pushing insane fake stories about Alfa Bank, the dirty [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=132.6s)]
*  dossier and a million other far-fetched Russia-related conspiracy theories. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=137.64s)]
*  By the way, never apologized, never attempted to correct the record. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=142.84s)]
*  There are multiple articles dedicated to Maddow's descent into the deep end. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's one from Politico titled, Rachel Maddow's Deep Delusion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And here's The Guardian. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Quote, will Rachel Maddow face a reckoning over her Trump-Russia coverage? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, apparently not, because last night she anchored MSDNC's coverage of the Republican [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  Iowa caucuses. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  Journalism, that is a joke at This is NBC News. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=173.72s)]
*  Of course, the same is true over at Fake News CNN. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=174.72s)]
*  For example, here's fake Jake Tapper cutting off Trump's victory speech in order that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=177.52s)]
*  he could cope and see at the same time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=182.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=185.72s)]
*  We have an invasion of millions and millions of people that are coming into our country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=186.72s)]
*  I can't imagine why they think that's a good thing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=191.36s)]
*  Donald Trump declaring victory with a historically strong showing in the Iowa caucuses if these [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=193.6s)]
*  numbers hold the biggest victory for a non-incumbent president in the modern era for this contest. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=199.12s)]
*  A relatively subdued speech as these things go so far, although here he is right now under [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  my voice. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=211.2s)]
*  You hear him repeating his anti-immigrant rhetoric. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=212.2s)]
*  Anti-immigrant. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=215.6s)]
*  Maybe you can call it pro-legal immigration rhetoric. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=217.72s)]
*  Just a thought. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=221.72s)]
*  Instead of playing Trump's full remarks so their viewers can decide themselves, fake [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=222.84s)]
*  Jake Tapper decided it was more important to trash Trump's speech in real time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=227.4s)]
*  Now, let me just, let me inform anybody that may accidentally pop onto Fake News CNN. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Jake Tapper is not a journalist. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=239.24s)]
*  He's a political hack. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=241.68s)]
*  He's a democratic operative. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=242.68s)]
*  He's living a lie. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=244.4s)]
*  He just needs to be honest about who he is. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=246.4s)]
*  Jake, it's clear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=249.64s)]
*  You have a deep-seated, left-wing bias and supreme hatred for all things Donald Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=251.16s)]
*  Just tell the truth about who you are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  You are a left-wing, radical talk show host. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=258.92s)]
*  You're not a journalist, as you claim. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=261.84s)]
*  And that's why we very accurately refer to you as Fake Jake. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=264.24s)]
*  Now, of course, self-described journalists like Tapper and Maddow don't just hate Donald [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=267.84s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=272.76s)]
*  They frankly hate everyone who supports him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=273.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=275.88s)]
*  Trump has in some ways become religion for a certain section of the American electorate, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=277.6s)]
*  and especially for evangelicals, that it's not about the virtue anymore. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=281.88s)]
*  It's about the vice that Trump expresses. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=285.44s)]
*  And I think you see that playing out in Iowa, where the evangelical vote is key. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=288.6s)]
*  It is central to what is going to unfold tonight. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=293.04s)]
*  And it is very much a group of people that find that Trump is in some ways a second coming. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=296.12s)]
*  These are white Christians. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=302.92s)]
*  That this is a state that is overrepresented by white Christians that are going to participate [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  in these caucuses, especially tonight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=309.68s)]
*  Regardless of whether or not they have any link to any church, it's I am not a Catholic, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=311.6s)]
*  I am not a Jew, and I am right-wing and willing to get rid of democracy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=316.04s)]
*  That's what evangelical means in real political terms right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=320.48s)]
*  Eighty percent of the Republican primary voters agree with this racially-charged comment coming [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=323.44s)]
*  from Donald Trump that immigrants coming here are illegally, quote, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=328.96s)]
*  poisoning the blood of this country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  That's so unsettling. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  He voted for a guy who said, come, risk your lives for the Grand Wizard. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=336.76s)]
*  Come in the snow and the sleet, because I am more important than your life. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=342.12s)]
*  That's who the five percent voted for. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=347.12s)]
*  Actually, he was laughing when he said that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=350.28s)]
*  Here's a simple truth, and it's one you already know. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=351.96s)]
*  The media mob, they hate all of you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=354.88s)]
*  By the way, yours truly included. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=358.24s)]
*  They hate everything about Americans that don't share their radical leftist worldview. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=360.08s)]
*  They think that they're smarter than everyone else. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=365.72s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=368.12s)]
*  They're not. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=369.08s)]
*  They don't care if Joe Biden's policies are hurting millions of Americans. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=370.08s)]
*  Sixty percent of Americans now are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Many people have to use a credit card for bare necessities. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=377.52s)]
*  They don't care about what's happening at our border. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=381.2s)]
*  You know, people coming from Iran and Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, you know, Russia, China, they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=383.68s)]
*  don't seem to care about inflation, homelessness, crime or the violence that's overseas. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  But they're deeply concerned that Biden's poor performance and obvious cognitive decline [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=396.44s)]
*  and mental incompetence will lead to a second Trump term. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=401.88s)]
*  In fact, so-called journalists and Democrats, well, in the country, they are now in a full-fledged [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=405.8s)]
*  panic mode. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=410.8s)]
*  Biden campaign aides, Simon, I'm sorry, Simone Sanders, just ripped Bidenomics and is now [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  begging the campaign to let it go. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  The focus should be on something else. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, former Obama adviser David Axelrod, not a dumb guy, is once again warning the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=424.52s)]
*  Democratic Party about a formidable Trump campaign. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=429.8s)]
*  Make no mistake, anything can happen between now and November. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  Nobody can predict with certainty how this is going to end. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=436.96s)]
*  Joe Biden has never looked worse. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump, frankly, has never looked better. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  And this week, a big new endorsement. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=444.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  I'll tell you, the people of Iowa spoke loud and clear last night, and I'm a big believer [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  that we the people create a government that is accountable to us, not the other way around. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  That we the people choose who leads this country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=459.44s)]
*  And so we heard, we the people last night, and that is why last evening I met my friend [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=462.79999999999995s)]
*  We met in person and I told him that I would endorse Donald J. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=468.4s)]
*  Trump for president of the United States. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VadvMu-4-k&t=471.68s)]
