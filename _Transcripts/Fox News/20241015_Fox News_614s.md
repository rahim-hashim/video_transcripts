# Sean Hannity: This would be the very definition of madness
**Fox News:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight Donald Trump has opened up a wide lead in the betting markets, bigger than I [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  thought possible. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Plus, Barstool founder Dave Portnoy is out with an epic takedown of Kamala Harris and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=8.52s)]
*  our own Harris Faulkner will join us with an exclusive preview of her town hall with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=14.8s)]
*  former President Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=20.88s)]
*  That'll air tomorrow right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But we begin with something different tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=24.12s)]
*  I want you to close your eyes for a second. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=25.92s)]
*  Not deep meditation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Maybe deep prayer, if you want. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  But try to imagine something actually pretty horrible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=33.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, this time next year, president and vice president in the White [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  House. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=42.48s)]
*  Because here's a preview of what life would be like in America, especially if they were [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=43.48s)]
*  to pass their very radical and extreme agenda, you know, like the Green New Deal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  First government spending and inflation will be worse than anything you have ever seen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=53.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris has made a lot of promises with your money. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=57.6s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=60.68s)]
*  That includes more than a trillion dollars in so-called student loan forgiveness, $25,000 [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=62.28s)]
*  to first-time home buyers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=67.4s)]
*  And that is only the beginning. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=69.16s)]
*  And then yesterday, because of the polls, where she's lagging in terms of demographically [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=70.92s)]
*  African-American men in this country, she announced another $20 billion in forgivable [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=75.92s)]
*  loans to African-Americans to be handed out on the basis of race. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=81.0s)]
*  And today, while speaking with Charlamagne the God, well, Kamala considered, you know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=85.64s)]
*  promised to consider a multi-trillion dollar reparations plan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=91.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  I am running to be a president for all Americans. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  That being said, I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  in which they exist, meaning history, to your point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=109.08s)]
*  So my agenda—well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=113.5s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=117.98s)]
*  And I've been very clear about that position. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=119.58s)]
*  Now, she said this in the past. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=121.74s)]
*  Nobody's ever asked her before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=123.86s)]
*  There is no amount of your money that Kamala will not spend to win a few votes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=125.58s)]
*  And of course, the Harris campaign is also promising to sweeten the deal with a different [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=131.54s)]
*  kind of green, if you will. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=135.34s)]
*  As the New York Post put it, quote, Kamala Harris urging African-American men to vote [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=138.02s)]
*  for her to legalize weed despite convicting herself 1,900 people as DA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  And as we have reported from day one, Kamala Harris is the single most radical extreme [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=148.78s)]
*  candidate to ever run for president as a major party nominee. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=153.62s)]
*  So expect to see a lot more stories like this one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=158.78s)]
*  Pay close attention. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=161.5s)]
*  Transgender yacht killer serving a life sentence gets a taxpayer-funded sex change surgery [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=162.94s)]
*  thanks to Kamala Harris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=170.14s)]
*  This is not a made-up story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  It is not AI-generated. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  It is not fake news. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=175.38s)]
*  It is not a cheap fake. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=176.38s)]
*  This murderer killed two grandparents on their boat by tying them to the vessel's anchor, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=178.2s)]
*  throwing them overboard before, quote, grabbing a beer from the fridge and starting to fish. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=183.33999999999997s)]
*  And according to court records, this was all part of an elaborate scheme to steal and launder [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=188.26s)]
*  enough money to pay for a sex change operation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=193.14s)]
*  And thanks to the policies set by Kamala Harris, she said it in her own words on tape, and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=196.77999999999997s)]
*  we know she's out there taking this position for many years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=201.5s)]
*  During her time as California's AG, this killer's wish was in fact granted after [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  murdering two people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=211.14s)]
*  According to a letter obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, this convicted killer claimed, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=212.5s)]
*  quote, I did receive gender-affirming surgery and breast augmentation on April 5, 2023, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=217.1s)]
*  compliments of California taxpayers, of course. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  But not only has Kamala Harris supported taxpayer-funded sex change operations for inmates, but she [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=227.38s)]
*  also supports taxpayer-funded money going to sex change operations for the 12.5 million [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=232.94s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants from over 180 countries, many with terror ties, many with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=240.82s)]
*  criminal backgrounds, many of our top geopolitical foes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=247.74s)]
*  This would be the very definition of madness. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=251.76s)]
*  Never mind California, Minnesota, you know, being okay with gender-affirming care for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  minors without parental consent. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=260.38s)]
*  Have they ever heard of parental rights? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=263.74s)]
*  And a brand new Trump campaign ad points this out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=265.98s)]
*  It is so insane, it's almost hard to believe, but it's real. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=269.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=274.18s)]
*  Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=275.18s)]
*  Surgery. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=278.74s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=279.74s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  How about we just enforce the immigration laws and secure the border, and if you murder [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=289.26s)]
*  two people, you don't get a taxpayer-funded sex change operation? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Seems pretty simple, seems pretty logical, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, apparently it was just too difficult for the border czar, allowed these millions [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=301.5s)]
*  and millions of unvetted illegals into our country, including known terrorists, but we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  don't know where they are, and people that were known murderers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  And look at all the dozens of Americans murdered, dozens of Americans, including children, raped, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=315.3s)]
*  hundreds of Americans victims of violent crime. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  We have allowed gang members, drug cartels into the country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=323.22s)]
*  And as I said, people were terrorized from countries like Iran and Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  Venezuela, China and Russia. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  In Boston, ICE detained an illegal alien who was previously convicted of trafficking fentanyl, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=335.82000000000005s)]
*  reported under Donald Trump. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=341.1s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=342.82s)]
*  He came right back into the country under Harris and Biden, was arrested for trafficking, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=343.82s)]
*  more fentanyl, carjacking and assault with a dangerous weapon. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=348.34s)]
*  And right here in the Free State of Florida, three Biden, Harris, unvetted illegals, they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=352.62s)]
*  were just arrested for sexually assaulting a child. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=356.82s)]
*  They also crossed over from the wide open southern border of your border czar, Kamala [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=360.02s)]
*  Harris. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=365.1s)]
*  And if Kamala gets elected, this crisis, you can bet, will get worse. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=366.1s)]
*  The border patrol officers, they are now reportedly planning to quit in droves if Kamala wins. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=369.5s)]
*  Look at these quotes from some of these people that work on the border in the New York Post. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=374.82s)]
*  I'm not doing this bleep again. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=379.62s)]
*  Four years of hell, said one agent, who's nowhere near retirement. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=382.5s)]
*  Another agent saying, lots of guys who can retire, they will go, and if Trump wins, they're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=386.94s)]
*  going to stay. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  What does that say? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  They want the support of the American people to do the job they were hired to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=396.22s)]
*  After all, what is the point of having a border patrol if there's no borders and they're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=400.98s)]
*  wide open? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, these are serious issues that are, frankly, national security issues at this point. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  And we have known terrorists in the country and murderers and rapists and other criminals [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=411.5s)]
*  and drug cartels and gang members, and the American people have every right to be worried [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=415.98s)]
*  about all of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=420.54s)]
*  There should not be a single apartment complex, Martha Raddatz, not one taken over by Venezuelan [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=422.06s)]
*  gangs. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=427.98s)]
*  And maybe somebody can help Martha do a little research and maybe ask Kamala Harris what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=428.98s)]
*  she would say to the families of Lake and Riley and Rachel Morin, the mother of five, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=434.7s)]
*  and little 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary and the others murdered by alleged, unvetted Harris [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=440.22s)]
*  Biden illegals. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=447.06s)]
*  There shouldn't be a single convicted killer, terrorist or any such person in this country [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=448.78s)]
*  that is not vetted. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  There shouldn't be allowed into our country, let alone thousands. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=458.38s)]
*  The American people deserve real solutions to the very real crisis that are impacting [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  small towns and big cities across the country. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=466.4s)]
*  Instead, the Harris campaign has been rolling out cheap gimmicks, taxpayer-funded—no, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=469.14s)]
*  where I grew up, they'd call it bribery, but I would never use that word—and Kamala's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=474.61999999999995s)]
*  weird running mate, of course, you know, assistant volunteer coach that claims to be the coach, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=479.22s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=484.22s)]
*  And after spending the weekend pretending to hunt pheasants with a shotgun that he was [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=485.34s)]
*  having a very hard time loading, well, today Tim Walz stepped up to the podium in a crisp, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=489.14s)]
*  new flannel shirt, accused J.D. Vance of faking his real-life story. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=494.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=500.38s)]
*  Senator Vance, he became a media darling. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=501.94s)]
*  He wrote a book about the place he grew up, but the premise was, was trashing that place [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=504.26s)]
*  where he grew up rather than lifting it up. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=509.86s)]
*  This guy's a venture capitalist cosplaying like he's a cowboy or something. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=512.34s)]
*  I don't even know what a venture capitalist does most of the time, because folks who go [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=517.14s)]
*  to work every day, they're the ones that are saying, what are you going to do with the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=521.34s)]
*  policies to make my life a little better? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=525.52s)]
*  You don't know what a venture capitalist does. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=527.46s)]
*  You have no business being the vice president. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=531.46s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, as a young man, Tim Walz spent a lot of time, well, gallivanting around [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=533.58s)]
*  Communist China. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=538.5s)]
*  And meanwhile, after growing up poor with a single mother, struggling with addiction, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=540.62s)]
*  well, J.D. Vance, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  He was deployed to Iraq. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=547.98s)]
*  But unlike Tim Walz, he didn't lie about his rank. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  He didn't falsely claim valor that he didn't deserve and claim he fought in a war zone. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=553.14s)]
*  He actually did. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  Vance used his service to help pay for college, ultimately law school at Yale. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=559.42s)]
*  He was then successful in business, got into politics. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=563.86s)]
*  And like so many other Americans, he is living the American dream, starting really at the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=566.62s)]
*  bottom, which apparently makes Tim Walz very angry and jealous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  And luckily, in three weeks, you can reject, and only you can reject, I'm only one vote, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=577.62s)]
*  in Georgia, North Carolina, in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, in the great [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=585.08s)]
*  state of Nevada, you can reject the insane policies, the utter incompetence that Walz [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=593.34s)]
*  and Harris represent. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH86qLbthlo&t=599.98s)]
