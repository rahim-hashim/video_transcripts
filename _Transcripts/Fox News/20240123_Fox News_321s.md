# Bill Hemmer breaks down county results in New Hampshire primary
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc)
*  Bill, what's the latest? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, good evening to you. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=1.84s)]
*  Interrupt me any time you want, OK? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=3.36s)]
*  I've got a lot to show you right now, show our viewers at home as to where we stand. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=4.36s)]
*  New Hampshire's counting slow tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=9.28s)]
*  And I say that, Sean, because you've got about a third of the vote in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=11.28s)]
*  And I don't know if that has something to do, I'm guessing, here now with the Democratic [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=14.94s)]
*  write-in vote, because if I flip over the Democratic race—again, we declared Joe Biden [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=18.8s)]
*  to be the winner—but you're just about 40 percent right there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=23.64s)]
*  I don't know if that has something to do with the slowdown, but it could be. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=27.2s)]
*  You're 33 percent reporting it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=31.36s)]
*  I'm going to flip through a bunch of stuff here, Sean, and try to explain a little bit [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=33.24s)]
*  about maybe what's happening out there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=36.2s)]
*  And as I do that, just this estimated vote that is in, just keep that number in mind, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=38.16s)]
*  OK, to the folks at home. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=43.16s)]
*  In New Hampshire, 70 percent of those who vote in the state live in four counties. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=44.96s)]
*  And they're all in the southern part of the state, and we're going to go through those [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  right now, OK, right along the border here with Massachusetts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=52.86s)]
*  This is Hillsborough's county. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=56.44s)]
*  Population, 30 percent of all in New Hampshire. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  That ranks one out of 10, OK? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=61.0s)]
*  Right, you see that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  You're 32 percent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, percentage-wise, leads by 12 points in Hillsborough County. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=65.84s)]
*  Seemed to be a good number for the Trump team. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=71.36s)]
*  Conversely, over here in Rockingham County, so your population, right, you're two out [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=73.84s)]
*  of 10 now for the whole state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=78.84s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of that vote out right now, Sean. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=80.72s)]
*  You're at 16 percent. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=84.24s)]
*  Donald Trump holds on to a six-point lead in Rockingham County. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=86.64s)]
*  If I were to take you back eight years ago, listen, the entire race was different then. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=89.64s)]
*  I grant you that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=94.64s)]
*  You had 10 Republicans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=95.64s)]
*  But in Rockingham County, against nine other Republicans, Trump fared pretty well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  You're shy of 39 percent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  Let's come back to modern days right now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's go to Concord. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=104.84s)]
*  This is Merrimack County. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=106.84s)]
*  Again, here's the number, 40 percent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  So there's still a lot of vote out there right now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  This is a slight edge over Nikki Haley by two points. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=112.84s)]
*  When I checked this about 10 minutes ago, Haley was leading in Merrimack, where you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=115.84s)]
*  find the capital city of Concord. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=119.84s)]
*  One other county, for the 70 percent that I mentioned, this is Stratford County. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=121.84s)]
*  So they're counting quicker, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=126.84s)]
*  That's 67 percent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=128.84s)]
*  You're two-thirds in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=130.84s)]
*  Trump leads Nikki Haley in this county by 11 points at 55 to 45. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=131.84s)]
*  So that's what's happening right now as I scan the state. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=136.84s)]
*  Now, with regard to Democrats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=139.84s)]
*  I'm going to explain something right now and take you back in time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=142.24s)]
*  That's going to say a lot about right now about maybe what the Democratic challenge [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=144.24s)]
*  is for Joe Biden. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=148.24s)]
*  OK, so we talked about this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=150.24s)]
*  Biden, the right-in candidate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=152.24s)]
*  Dean Phillips still hanging in there at 20 percent. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=154.24s)]
*  Someone impressive, I would argue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=156.24s)]
*  If I were to come out of this, Sean, and take you, do a little history lesson, OK? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=158.24s)]
*  So this is, got it, OK. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=163.24s)]
*  This is the Democratic outcome for 2020. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  They ran all across the state, all right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, where was Joe Biden in that race? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  He was fifth at 8 percent. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  If I were to take you a week prior to that in the Iowa caucus back in 2020, it was Bernie [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden is not there in the gold, silver or bronze. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  He was at fourth place, just shy of 14 percent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=193.04s)]
*  So then, Biden made a calculation when he was here in New Hampshire. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=197.04s)]
*  He left before the tally came out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=201.04s)]
*  He did not go to Nevada. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=203.04s)]
*  He went to South Carolina. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=204.04s)]
*  In about 17 days after New Hampshire results, this is what happened. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=206.04s)]
*  On leap day of 2020, Joe Biden, shy of 50 percent, that catapulted and passed Bernie [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=212.04s)]
*  Sanders, led him on this tear across the country for the remaining states. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=218.04s)]
*  He became the nominee and later became the president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=222.44s)]
*  So now then, we're going to head to South Carolina in about a month's time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=225.44s)]
*  And on the Republican side, that is when the race will be held, if Nikki Haley continues [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=231.44s)]
*  with the current position that she announced here just a short time ago. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=236.44s)]
*  On the calendar, here is how it shakes down, OK? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=240.44s)]
*  You're in January. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=243.44s)]
*  We had two big contests right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=244.44s)]
*  New Hampshire is still playing out, as I showed you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=246.44s)]
*  And we're going to tick in the February. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=248.44s)]
*  This matters for Republicans, Nevada caucus, all right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=250.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's competing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=253.84s)]
*  He's probably going to take all the delegates from that caucus that night at 26. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=254.84s)]
*  Nikki Haley elected for the primary. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=259.84s)]
*  It's a confusing matter. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=261.84s)]
*  They split it up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=264.04s)]
*  It is what it is, but the caucus will matter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=265.38s)]
*  Then you get to South Carolina, OK? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=267.64s)]
*  We're going to see the measure of strength right now in South Carolina, the 50 delegates [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=269.24s)]
*  out there, because as we start the night here—hang with me one second here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=273.04s)]
*  I'll show you this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=278.24s)]
*  This is where we started the night. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=279.84s)]
*  You need 1,215 delegates to get the nomination. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=280.84s)]
*  Trump took 20 out of Iowa. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=284.34s)]
*  DeSantis took nine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  He dropped out, as you know, a couple days back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  And Nikki Haley was at eight. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=289.24s)]
*  She's going to get some delegates tonight, but this contest could go on some time if [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=290.44s)]
*  Nikki Haley, the former governor and ambassador who worked for Donald Trump during his term [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=294.76s)]
*  in the White House, chooses to stay in. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=300.5s)]
*  And that's where we are. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Sean? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, Bill Hemmer at the big board tonight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  We'll be checking back in with you throughout the evening. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqb2DXUVxbc&t=306.64s)]
