# Ron DeSantis: New Florida law will provide answers on Jeffrey Epstein
**Fox News:** [March 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc)
*  It was an extremely sad and solemn day in the state of Georgia today, where mourners [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=0.0s)]
*  gathered in the town of Woodstock to say goodbye to Lake and Riley. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  She was the 22-year-old nursing student brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant on the campus [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=11.74s)]
*  of the University of Georgia only last week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=17.36s)]
*  The funeral now follows a vigil held on that campus. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=20.2s)]
*  Look at the size of this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Seems like every student came out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=25.2s)]
*  That was held earlier this week. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=27.44s)]
*  Hundreds, thousands of students gathering to mourn Lakin's death. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=29.48s)]
*  And sadly, she is only the latest victim of the now deadly, devastating consequences [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=34.24s)]
*  of Joe Biden's open border chaos and, unfortunately, will likely not be the last unless we take [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=39.4s)]
*  dramatic action. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=46.3s)]
*  Anyway, joining us now with more of the governor, the great state of Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=47.3s)]
*  You know, Governor, I try to put myself in the position, and you're a dad, you have young [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=52.44s)]
*  children, try to put yourself in the position of this young woman's parents and grandparents [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=57.16s)]
*  and siblings and loved ones. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=62.08s)]
*  How do you recover from something like that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=65.44s)]
*  And what's so infuriating about this was not only once coming into the country illegally, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=67.84s)]
*  they had another opportunity to deport this individual in a case in New York. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=73.24s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=78.7s)]
*  I mean, at some point, when do we, when do we hold accountable the peoples whose policies [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=80.14s)]
*  are allowing this to happen, allowing these people to stay? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=85.94s)]
*  Well, Sean, unfortunately, these angel parents, and they're not alone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=92.3s)]
*  This happens all over the country nowadays, where you lose a child at the hands of somebody [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=97.42s)]
*  in this country illegally here, thanks to Joe Biden and thanks to these sanctuary policies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=103.68s)]
*  Look, we work very hard as a governor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=110.61999999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=112.66s)]
*  I know a lot of people around the country of keeping people safe. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=113.66s)]
*  When you have a crime like this, a murder by an illegal alien, by definition, that would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=116.66s)]
*  not have happened had Joe Biden simply enforced the law. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=121.42s)]
*  They are green lighting this and paving the way for this to happen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=126.5s)]
*  And you're right, Sean, to mention New York, because New York City is a sanctuary jurisdiction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  You have a criminal alien there brought up on charges who is in the country illegally. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Right then and there, the appropriate thing is to get them into deportation proceedings [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=144.38s)]
*  and make sure that they get sent back to their home country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=149.82s)]
*  That's not what they do in New York. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=152.9s)]
*  They don't cooperate. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=154.34s)]
*  They release back onto the street. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=155.62s)]
*  And so this guy ends up down in Georgia, and he kills Lake and Riley. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=157.82s)]
*  And I'd also say this Athens mayor has liberal policies in Athens, Georgia as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  We banned sanctuary cities in Florida my first year as governor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=168.54s)]
*  I mean, if you have somebody here illegally, especially if they're involved in the justice [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=172.7s)]
*  system, you don't release them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=177.14s)]
*  You've got to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=179.14s)]
*  So this whole thing was avoidable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=182.42s)]
*  And unfortunately, she is not the only victim. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=185.26s)]
*  This is happening all over this country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=188.72s)]
*  When we did the debate with Gavin Newsom that you hosted, I identified a case in California [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=191.06s)]
*  where Los Angeles released somebody who had been deported multiple times illegally in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=196.78s)]
*  the country, brought up on charges. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=202.06s)]
*  They refused to turn him over to ICE, and he murdered the mother of a three-year-old. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=204.14s)]
*  This is what Joe Biden's America has come to. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=209.06s)]
*  You know, let me let me shift gears here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=212.06s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's mysterious death that was what nearly five years ago obviously did nothing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=214.78s)]
*  to put to rest the many, many questions about many misdeeds and a special plea deal that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  took place before your time as governor in Florida. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=225.54s)]
*  We could be a bit closer to some answers because you're supporting legislation and you've signed [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  legislation that will allow for the release of the currently secret grand jury testimony [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=235.94s)]
*  from his original case in the state. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=241.24s)]
*  Boy, from all the details that I have read about this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=243.9s)]
*  Wow, that had to be the plea deal of all plea deals. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=248.14s)]
*  Unbelievable what happened. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, this was involved in federal jurisdiction at the time, and the feds worked [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=255.34s)]
*  to engineer this plea deal with the prosecutor in Palm Beach County. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=260.14s)]
*  And this happened, you know, 15, 20 years ago when I became governor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  We launched a criminal investigation in exactly what happened. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=268.78s)]
*  How did he get this sweetheart deal? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=271.78s)]
*  But what we ran into was grand jury secrecy laws. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  And that is true in Florida. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=278.29999999999995s)]
*  If you test it by in front of a grand jury, it's secret. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=279.61999999999995s)]
*  It's got to be kept secret. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=281.82s)]
*  And so and then people tried to petition to get it released under some of the exceptions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=283.61999999999995s)]
*  and all those court cases failed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=287.82s)]
*  So the Florida legislature passed legislation now which authorizes the release of all those [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=289.5s)]
*  grand jury files. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=295.78s)]
*  And so I signed it into law this week. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  That law will become effective on July 1st. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  Finally, the public is going to be able to get answers. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=302.22s)]
*  But we had a few of the they're now women, they're in their 30s, but they were teenagers, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  a lot of them were I think were 14 at the time. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=310.94s)]
*  And this has been something that stayed with them for decades and they never got any justice. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=313.54s)]
*  And so now we're going to get more facts. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=318.74s)]
*  And how is it, Sean, when you have so many people involved, you have one person now, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=320.86s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell, who's in who's in federal prison. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=326.78s)]
*  Nobody else has been held accountable since Epstein's death. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=329.82s)]
*  And I think everybody knows that that is not right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=334.7s)]
*  And there's no way that nobody else was involved in this criminal activity. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=337.82s)]
*  I agree with that completely. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you about a bill that you vetoed that banned social media for kids under 16. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  You were very clear that you would support some measures, but not this strict a measure. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=351.18s)]
*  Dr. Phil actually pointed out something in his new book, the total number of hours [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=358.78s)]
*  that kids are spending online. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=363.58s)]
*  I mean, it's it numbs the mind to think about it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=366.54s)]
*  And then they're subjected to things by the things that are sent by people that are targeting [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=370.78s)]
*  children specifically with material that is not age appropriate, to say the least. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=377.66s)]
*  Yeah, so we're going to end up getting a product. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  Part of it is right now in federal law under 13, you're barred from having a social media [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=389.1s)]
*  account. And yet there's a whole bunch of people under 13 that have it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=394.70000000000005s)]
*  So we're going to have enforcement on that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  We're also going to, though, say for these teenagers, the 14, the 15 year olds, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  there should be a parent involvement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=405.42s)]
*  So we're going to include parent involvement. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=407.34s)]
*  And then we're going to make sure that in our valiant efforts to protect children, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=409.26s)]
*  we're not infringing on adults rights to use social media anonymously. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=414.46s)]
*  I believe in anonymous speech. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't want to have to force everybody to give their names like Nikki Haley wanted to. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  So I think we're going to have the appropriate balance. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think you'll end up seeing a product that I think people can rally behind. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  I saw that Sylvester Stallone is now making Florida, the free state of Florida, his home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  I hope you're not taking too much heat that I've moved down to your state. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=436.94s)]
*  I've had property here for over 20 plus years. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=440.3s)]
*  And I will tell you, probably the smartest decision of my life. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=444.06s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=447.1s)]
*  And finally, I actually have a governor I like. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=448.14s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=450.3s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=451.42s)]
*  I hope you're not taking too much heat. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=452.54s)]
*  God bless, Sean. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=454.46s)]
*  Thanks for coming down. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=455.42s)]
*  All right. Appreciate it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=457.34s)]
*  We will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jJ-RAwoNnc&t=466.94s)]
