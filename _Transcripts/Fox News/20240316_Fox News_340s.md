# Judge Jeanine: Fani Willis case is mired in dishonesty and lies
**Fox News:** [March 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8)
*  Here to respond, she is the co-host of the hit show, The Five, Judge Janine Pirro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=0.0s)]
*  Judge, all right, let's get your overall take here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=4.96s)]
*  And we've also—I know, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=7.4s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=9.8s)]
*  I can't. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=11.28s)]
*  All right, now you're making me—you can't make this up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  But you do have one other concept, legal concept we got to look at, and that's the fruit of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=15.96s)]
*  the poisonous tree here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Wouldn't this mean that all the evidence gathered by Nathan Wade—don't they have to throw [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=21.56s)]
*  that out? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, you could certainly make that argument, but remember who the judge is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  This is a judge, you'll recall, Sean, that I told you didn't have the spine to hold [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=32.72s)]
*  Fannie Willis in contempt when she started running the courtroom, pointing her finger [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=38.76s)]
*  at him and telling everybody that she wasn't on trial. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=43.2s)]
*  So this judge, who is two weeks away from this next election and doesn't want to upset [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  any of his constituents, makes a decision that is absurd. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=51.86s)]
*  If Wade is in a situation where he was so dishonest that he lied about the relationship, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=57.36s)]
*  that they've got to cut him from the case, why isn't Fannie being cut from the case? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=64.48s)]
*  I mean, that is an absolute bottom-line question. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=69.2s)]
*  This is a case that is mired in scandal and is mired in, as the judge said, an odor of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=73.08s)]
*  mendacity, dishonesty and lies. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=79.88s)]
*  And for the judge to come out and say, you know, I don't know if this is an actual [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  conflict of interest, we've still got the Georgia bar and we've got this state investigative [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=87.36s)]
*  commission, four commissions that can look into this, judge, you were the one who sat [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  on the evidentiary hearing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=97.64s)]
*  You were the one who were supposed to make the decision about what witnesses were lying [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=99.34s)]
*  and what witnesses were telling the truth. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=103.44s)]
*  And for you to decide that Wade, the boyfriend, he's got to go because he is not capable [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=105.92s)]
*  of telling the truth. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  He lied about the same thing she lied about and she confirmed his lies. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=112.7s)]
*  But he goes and she doesn't? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=116.9s)]
*  Look, the speech she made at the church, Sean, is enough. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=118.94s)]
*  That is race-baiting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=122.98s)]
*  As a DA, I would be canned for making a speech like that, basically saying that a defendant [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  that I'm prosecuting is a racist and that is enough to get her off. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=130.26s)]
*  But this judge doesn't have the chutzpah to get him off, to get her off the case and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=135.38s)]
*  leaves it up to her. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  And for anybody who has any doubt, she's not going to leave this case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  She could care less that Wade is gone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=145.58s)]
*  She got five vacations or six vacations in five months and the judge said, well, we can't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=147.84s)]
*  be sure how much money really passed, but there wasn't enough evidence. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=153.7s)]
*  Judge, I know you're new to this, but your job is to decide the facts, decide the evidence, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=157.82s)]
*  who lied, what the money amount was, and you can't then turn around and say, you know, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=163.22s)]
*  it's kind of hard to tell. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=167.86s)]
*  And also this guy, Terrence Bradley, who's the boyfriend's lawyer, he said in an affidavit [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=169.5s)]
*  they absolutely started the affair before the job. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=174.74s)]
*  He takes the stand and what's the word? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  He was inconsistent. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=180.3s)]
*  His demeanor was unusual. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=181.86s)]
*  He was unresponsive. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  And he said, I couldn't make a conclusion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  Judge, you can make a conclusion by drawing in the fact that there is this inconsistency, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=187.22s)]
*  there is this guilty demeanor, there is this lack of responsiveness to something that's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=193.28s)]
*  an absolute sworn to statement. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  But this judge doesn't have the spine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=200.64s)]
*  In the end, the people trying this case, Sean, are going to be trying a case that they know [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=203.14s)]
*  is a mess. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  The two of them lied and they're trying to try Donald Trump for lying and offering false [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=209.64s)]
*  statements. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=215.12s)]
*  And I got to tell you, you know who wins in this case? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=216.12s)]
*  The prosecutor with the boyfriend off the case. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  That's a win for her. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=221.68s)]
*  This guy doesn't know his way around a courtroom. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=223.18s)]
*  He's never even tried to fill any case, let alone a Rico case. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=225.6s)]
*  But Judge, let me ask you, because look, friends of mine in Georgia told me this guy, because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=228.68s)]
*  of the reelection that he's going to be facing soon, that they predicted that he'd split [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=234.48s)]
*  the baby, which is what he pretty much did. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  But he also poisoned the well against her in an appeal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to imagine one party created an appearance of conflict, but not Willis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=244.88s)]
*  So the logic of the judge and his unwillingness to go the full step, I think he has set her [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=251.28s)]
*  up now to be out of this case as well. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=258.02s)]
*  Time will tell if I'm proven right, but I see it that way. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=260.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=263.28s)]
*  Well, we'll see whether or not, when the appeal takes place, whether, certainly the case is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=264.28s)]
*  now delayed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=269.3s)]
*  The appellate division or whatever the second level is called in the state of Georgia has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=271.04s)]
*  a lot of decisions to make. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=275.08s)]
*  I think that in the end, this fact finding, what little there is, is enough to get her [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=277.08s)]
*  off. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=282.76s)]
*  No one, no one can explain why he has to go, but she doesn't when she's the one who benefited [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=283.76s)]
*  from the money. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=290.56s)]
*  And the money that he made, $650,000, now I was a DA for 30 years. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=291.56s)]
*  I was an assistant DA and the elected DA three times. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=297.12s)]
*  You don't pay anybody $350,000 who's never tried a felony case. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  This is corrupt from the get-go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=306.24s)]
*  All right, Judge Pirro, we can catch you every day, of course, on The Five. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=308.24s)]
*  Why are you making me laugh? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=313.44s)]
*  Because it's actually humorous when you actually look at the ruling. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=314.44s)]
*  You can't make, because you can't make this stuff up. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  You really can't. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=321.76s)]
*  They can. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=322.76s)]
*  It's like out of a spy novel or a judicial novel that you couldn't even make up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ieloxrB-s8&t=323.76s)]
