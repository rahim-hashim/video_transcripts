# Incoming Trump 'border czar' puts criminal migrants on notice
**Fox News:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE)
*  The latest incoming Trump orders are Tom Homan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tom, last night, we were asked about the general framework for immigration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  You said it will be ready to go on Inauguration Day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=7.8s)]
*  You're going to hit the ground running. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=10.56s)]
*  And I thought of this NBC report I read a few weeks ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=12.34s)]
*  I want to pull it up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=15.36s)]
*  And it said this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=16.36s)]
*  Much of the first day is likely to focus on stopping illegal immigration, the centerpiece [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=17.36s)]
*  of Trump's candidacy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=21.54s)]
*  He's expected to sign up to five executive orders aimed at dealing with that issue alone [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=22.7s)]
*  after he's sworn in on January 20th. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=27.72s)]
*  That's according to three Trump allies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=30.24s)]
*  And this is as many orders as he signed on every single issue the first week of his last [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=32.68s)]
*  term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=38.56s)]
*  Does that bring true in your mind that these executive orders will be coming day one? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=39.56s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=44.32s)]
*  And more than five, more than three, there can be many already working on them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  So look, he's got he's got a mandate from American people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=51.92s)]
*  We can't have strong national security if we don't have border security. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=56.04s)]
*  So there's going to be some executive orders signed on day one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=59.36s)]
*  At the same time he's signing those executive orders, we got ICE officers across the country [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=62.0s)]
*  going to start they're going to be hitting the streets looking for criminal illegal aliens. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=65.92s)]
*  At the same time, we'll be putting ending catch release day one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=70.76s)]
*  At the same day, we're also going to be looking for over 340,000 missing children. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=75.36s)]
*  We got a lot happening on day one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=79.78s)]
*  It starts on day one, but it's going to continue until we finish the job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=81.52s)]
*  Yeah, more than five executive orders. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=85.84s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=89.0s)]
*  That's sending a clear priority of immigration across the starting line of this administration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=90.0s)]
*  I was also really intrigued by the CNN report I read. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=95.24s)]
*  I don't know if it's true or not true, but I think when people think the Trump administration [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  so radical and what they want to do, the CNN headline reads this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=101.88s)]
*  Some part of Trump's deportation plan may be Obama esque. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=106.0s)]
*  This is a quote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=110.24s)]
*  A lot of the same tactics are being dusted off. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=111.24s)]
*  What Tom is talking about are Obama esque things. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=113.52s)]
*  That's according to John Sandweg who served as acting ICE director under Obama. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=116.44s)]
*  You worked in the Obama administration. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  You now work for President Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=123.08s)]
*  Do you think some of this will be coming from the Obama playbook? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I forgot more about this game in Beyonce, Beyonce, in a way whatever [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=127.84s)]
*  know. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=134.4s)]
*  But bottom line is Obama did concentrate on public safety threats. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=135.4s)]
*  He did. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=140.6s)]
*  But, you know, the results are terrible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=141.6s)]
*  Look at the administration now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=144.92s)]
*  I looked at the data of this administration right now and there's 74 percent decrease [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=146.2s)]
*  on the arrests of criminal aliens. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  I noticed today they released numbers of bragging they deported more illegal aliens than President [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=155.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=159.04s)]
*  Look, I put that report together. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=160.04s)]
*  You're not going to fool me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=161.72s)]
*  I looked at that report. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=162.72s)]
*  Bottom line is over 80 percent of those removals were people that rested on the border by the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=163.76s)]
*  board patrol, not ICE arrests, and removed right at the border. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=168.32s)]
*  Interior arrests were down 80 percent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  So they play a numbers game, but President Trump's numbers are going to blow all these [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=173.76s)]
*  numbers out of the water because we're going to let ICE do their job. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=178.0s)]
*  We're going to take ICE, we're going to take the handcuffs off ICE and we're going to put [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=180.84s)]
*  them on the bad guy starting day one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=184.68s)]
*  The numbers games are always interesting when we just have facts that young women, mothers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=188.28s)]
*  of five like Rachel Moran have been killed when they go out for jogs by people who shouldn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  have even been here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=196.64s)]
*  So that tells you all you need to know. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  But as we look at this, not only do you have these tragic stories, you have an election [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=200.2s)]
*  where 77 million people voted for Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=204.76s)]
*  Trump always said he believed immigration was the reason he would win. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=207.72s)]
*  I think there's a lot of truth in that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=212.0s)]
*  It is not why you're seeing this is an Axios. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  Democrats who say they're wanting to play ball with you guys. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=217.32s)]
*  Here's Mark Kelly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  If there's willingness to work in a bipartisan way to do some stuff, not only on border security, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  but on immigration, I think it would be great. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=226.6s)]
*  Here's Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=228.4s)]
*  Also, we've been clear as Democrats in the Senate were willing to work with Republicans, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=230.0s)]
*  Richard Blumenthal even. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=233.96s)]
*  There are all kinds of conversations. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=235.88s)]
*  I hope to be a part of them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  Amy, at Comprehensive Immigration Reform, could you see a realm of possibility where [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=238.88s)]
*  you get Democrat votes on your first legislative priority? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=243.76s)]
*  I'm pessimistic about that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=250.8s)]
*  But look, I hope it happens. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=252.32s)]
*  Look, there's two things. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=253.8s)]
*  Number one, these elected officials, their number one responsibility is protecting Americans, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=255.88s)]
*  protecting their communities. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=260.92s)]
*  President Trump and myself have been very clear. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=262.48s)]
*  We're going to target public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=263.96s)]
*  What elected official does not want public safety threats removed from their communities? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=267.44s)]
*  That's their number one responsibility. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=271.24s)]
*  Second, I think they looked at the results of the election. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=272.72s)]
*  This was the number one issue that President Trump ran on, and he won this election overwhelmingly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=275.76s)]
*  So I think they realized, look, we missed the ball on immigration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=281.4s)]
*  A lot of Democrats are speaking up now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  They should have done more on immigration, more on the border. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=285.6s)]
*  And the American people are rightly upset about it and know we're going to fix it for them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=288.24s)]
*  So I hope Democrats come to the table. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=292.2s)]
*  I don't hold out a lot of hope, because already I got sanctuary cities saying they're [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=294.64s)]
*  going to try to get in our way. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=298.6s)]
*  They're trying to sell pieces of the border wall. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=300.0s)]
*  They're trying to sign legislation in the last minute to try to keep more here under [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=302.16s)]
*  the parole program. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=307.48s)]
*  They're pushing more through CBP One app than I've ever seen. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=308.48s)]
*  They're trying to set President Trump up for failure. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=312.28s)]
*  But let me tell you something. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=316.2s)]
*  President Trump, his success on the border is unprecedented. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  I've worked for six presidents. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  No one did more than President Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=322.84s)]
*  We're going to have success again, except this time we're going to finish the job, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  and we're going to end up the most secure border in the history of this nation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=327.96s)]
*  Final question. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=333.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't have a ton of time here, but I was seeing publications putting out the lie of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=334.11999999999995s)]
*  the year, and it just was crazy to me, because to me the lie of the year is nothing's going [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  wrong in Aurora, Colorado, where we saw gang takeovers of apartment buildings. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  I just want to remind everyone of what the media was saying. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  ABC, JD Vance stands by Trump's false claim about Venezuela gangs in Aurora. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=349.24s)]
*  Washington Post, Trump campaigns in Aurora, cite a false claims about gangs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  New York Times, how the false stories about gang takeovers in Aurora reach Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And now we have Tom Homan, this reporting that 19 individuals we think were part of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  a Venezuelan gang were arrested for torturing two people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  What do you think when you see those headlines? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=372.72s)]
*  It's just constant lies by these elected officials. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=376.6s)]
*  And look, I went to Aurora. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=379.04s)]
*  I went to that apartment complex. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt1frKfJ5JE&t=380.76000000000005s)]
