# Gianno Caldwell launches the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety
**Fox News:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94)
*  As we know, our friend and our colleague, Giano Caldwell, lost his brother Christian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=0.0s)]
*  to gun violence in Chicago two years ago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=6.3s)]
*  Ever since then, he has been unrelenting. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=9.4s)]
*  He's been hard at work fighting against progressive policies, lawlessness in honor of his brother [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  and thousands of other victims of these senseless crimes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=17.98s)]
*  And today, Giano Caldwell is announcing the next step in his fight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=21.48s)]
*  Well, I'm going to let him announce it himself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  The Caldwell Institute for Public Safety. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=29.0s)]
*  I gathered a vast team of experts, visionaries and game changers and created the Caldwell [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=32.56s)]
*  Institute for Public Safety. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  On June 24th, 2022, my life changed forever when my innocent baby brother Christian was [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  murdered on the streets of Chicago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=46.2s)]
*  Christian was 18 and excited about starting college. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=49.28s)]
*  But on that terrible day, he became just one more of those 16,000 murdered across the United [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=53.88s)]
*  States that same year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=60.88s)]
*  Help support the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Go to caldwellinstitute.org. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=67.2s)]
*  Giano joins us now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=71.88s)]
*  I remember many conversations we had. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=74.6s)]
*  And the one thing you said to me from day one, Giano, is you are not going to stop. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=76.8s)]
*  And this is going to come to an end. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=83.48s)]
*  And this changed the entire trajectory of your life. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=85.6s)]
*  And I give you so much credit for all you're doing and want to help and support any way [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=89.2s)]
*  I can. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  And this has become a mission for me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  And I cannot thank you enough, Sean. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=97.2s)]
*  You have been on this journey with me for two years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=99.92s)]
*  We talk at least once a week over the phone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=103.12s)]
*  You encourage me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=104.8s)]
*  You're my big brother. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=105.88s)]
*  You are my mentor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=106.88s)]
*  And I can't thank you for what you do for me and many thousands of other people across [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=108.22s)]
*  the country, across the nation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=113.2s)]
*  I got to tell you, there's one man that comes to mind when I think about the chaos that's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=115.16s)]
*  been ensuing across our country with the progressive prosecutors, mayors, city council members. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=120.0s)]
*  That person is George Soros, who's invested millions of dollars into these soft on crime [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=125.9s)]
*  prosecutors, funding over 75 of them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=131.67999999999998s)]
*  It should not be that from 2021 to 2022, over 276 children, 16 and younger, shot in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=134.32s)]
*  city of Chicago. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=142.12s)]
*  It should not be that in Washington, D.C., our elected officials, congressmen, are being [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=143.44s)]
*  beat up, robbed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=148.56s)]
*  It should not be in Manhattan, where you got Alvin Bragg, who chooses not to prosecute [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=150.2s)]
*  unless it's political, an individual who has a prosecutorial rate that imprisons people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=157.48s)]
*  of less than 7 percent with all the crime that goes on in New York City. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=163.32s)]
*  We have to change the direction of this country as George Soros has reshaped our judicial [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=168.28s)]
*  system and has decided that he wanted to destroy America from within. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=174.64s)]
*  So what am I doing with the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=179.2s)]
*  We're going to be running programming against those soft on crime prosecutors. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  We are going to be supporting those who choose to be about law and order. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  We are going to be advocating for legislation that makes communities safer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=192.38s)]
*  And we're going to be looking to stop legislation that endanger the lives of residents all across [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=196.88s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=202.12s)]
*  That's what I look forward to doing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=203.12s)]
*  And I hope people go visit CaldwellInstitute.org and follow me on social media, at Gianna Caldwell [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=204.48000000000002s)]

*  that has had to experience this senseless violence. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=230.76s)]
*  It can be stopped. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=234.32s)]
*  We're going to support you and we're going to follow the success. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=236.36s)]

*  We launch June 24th on Monday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=240.24s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z2DWg2b94&t=241.24s)]
