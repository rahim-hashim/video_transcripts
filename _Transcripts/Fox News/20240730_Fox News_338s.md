# Morgan Ortagus: The Islamic Republic of Iran is being 'empowered'
**Fox News:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc)
*  All right, this weekend, Hezbollah killed 12 children and teenagers with a rocket attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Golan Heights, leading to increased concerns of an all-out war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=7.12s)]
*  By the way, an Iranian missile, we believe, was used. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=11.44s)]
*  And while the White House says Israel has every right to respond, they also reportedly, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=13.96s)]
*  as usual, are urging restraint. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=18.92s)]
*  U.S. officials reportedly warning Israel that hitting Hezbollah targets in Beirut would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=20.96s)]
*  likely cause the conflict to spiral out of control. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=25.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is under fire for her shaky support of Israel after the vice [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=28.96s)]
*  president delivered remarks last week, desperately trying to please both sides after meeting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=33.6s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=38.92s)]
*  Here now with more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=41.2s)]
*  Former senior White House adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller, along with the Morgan [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=42.2s)]
*  Ortegas Show podcast, also formerly with the State Department, Morgan Ortegas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=46.78s)]
*  Morgan, she didn't show up for Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=52.2s)]
*  Then, according to reports, she tried to lecture him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=56.16s)]
*  And we know the Biden administration has been doing everything but support Israel's right [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=60.08s)]
*  to win their war on radical Islamic terrorists, which would have been the equivalent of October [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=65.64s)]
*  7th losing 40,000 Americans in a day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=71.2s)]
*  Why have they surrendered in the war on terror? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=74.48s)]
*  Well, listen, we were told the adults would be back in charge, and the adults have brought [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=76.24s)]
*  us nothing but war and chaos. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=80.92s)]
*  Listen, there's almost a major catastrophe or war in every year of the Biden administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=83.2s)]
*  And now here we are after, in 10 months after October 7th, we still don't have our hostages [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=88.12s)]
*  home. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=93.04s)]
*  We still have five Americans that are left behind in Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=94.04s)]
*  And, of course, there perhaps might be another major Middle Eastern war breaking out, Sean. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=97.04s)]
*  And this is because the adults are not in charge. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=105.72s)]
*  They are empowering the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Why does all of this matter to Americans? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=109.64s)]
*  Well, you may not believe it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=111.84s)]
*  You may listen to Biden when he said on Tuesday night that American troops were not engaged [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=113.28s)]
*  in war around the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=117.64s)]
*  In fact, we are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=118.64s)]
*  We are dealing with the Houthis shooting ballistic missiles and drones at our ships at our American [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=120.26s)]
*  embassy facilities in Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=125.08s)]
*  Americans died in January at the hands of Iranian-made drones. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  So America is under attack. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel is under attack. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=133.72s)]
*  And after they kill little babies, little children who are on a playground over the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=134.72s)]
*  This administration's response yet again is to try to tie Israel's hands behind their [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=140.24s)]
*  back. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=144.24s)]
*  We played earlier in my monologue tonight, Stephen Miller, we played Kamala Harris saying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=145.24s)]
*  we need to have the courage to never use the term radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=150.44000000000003s)]
*  We need the courage to never use the term illegal alien. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=155.8s)]
*  Well, then who attacked us on 9-11-01? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=159.4s)]
*  Who attacked Israel? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=163.12s)]
*  What is in, you know, tell me about the group Hamas, whose own charter calls for the destruction [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=164.86s)]
*  of Israel, a known terrorist organization. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=170.1s)]
*  What would she like us to call them? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  You cannot be president of this country if you can't say the words radical Islamic [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=185.38s)]
*  Look at those dead bodies in Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Look at those children who were butchered. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=189.44s)]
*  Look at what happened on our own soil on 9-11. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=192.32s)]
*  Thousands of Americans murdered by savage terrorists in cold blood. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=197.16s)]
*  Look what's happened to Europe as the radical Islamic caliphate has spread into European [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=201.92s)]
*  capitals, making life unlivable for millions of citizens in the face of constant attacks [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=208.16s)]
*  and threats and violence. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=214.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris will bring the caliphate here to the United States through her open border, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=218.14s)]
*  through her weakness, through her radical socialist pro-Hamas policies. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=223.14s)]
*  This is existential for America, Sean. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=228.32s)]
*  You've covered it for so many years in your program. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  Weakness and surrender in the face of radical Islamic terrorism combined with open borders [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  is a recipe for national suicide. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=240.06s)]
*  You know, and Morgan, when you really look at it, by not allowing Israel—again, extrapolate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=243.16s)]
*  out, compare our population to their population—that would have been 40,000 dead Americans on October [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=250.28s)]
*  7th. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=255.04s)]
*  By not allowing and fighting and urging restraint with Israel and not supporting their outright [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  victory in the war on terror, doesn't it encourage things like what happened this weekend? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=263.7s)]
*  Because if you win the war against radical Islamic terrorists, things like that don't [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=268.88s)]
*  happen, do they? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=273.2s)]
*  You put an end to it once and for all, and the death stops, in this case, dead children. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=274.6s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=279.8s)]
*  And in fact, this policy of the Biden-Harris administration, where they want to de-escalate [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=281.92s)]
*  around the world, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=286.92s)]
*  That's their favorite phrase. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=287.92s)]
*  Oh, we want diplomacy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=288.92s)]
*  We want to de-escalate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=289.92s)]
*  And in fact, those actions, those policies are escalatory. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=290.92s)]
*  It's why we saw October 7th happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=295.64s)]
*  It's why we continue to see attacks from the Iranian proxies throughout the region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=297.68s)]
*  And by the way, Israel, we support them, but they don't need our permission. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't have to allow them to do anything. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=307.48s)]
*  They need to go after the terrorists and protect their country, no matter who stands with them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=309.16s)]
*  I know I will stand with them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=314.16s)]
*  I can't say the same for Biden-Harris. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=315.52s)]
*  I've known Prime Minister Netanyahu for 30 years. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=318.32s)]
*  I can promise you, it doesn't matter what Kamala Harris or Joe Biden says. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=321.04s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6_P5uO9cc&t=325.68s)]
