# Sen. Lindsey Graham on NJ drones: I don't trust them to tell the truth
**Fox News:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4)
*  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is with us. Senator, look, you're as involved in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=0.0s)]
*  homeland security and national security as anybody in Washington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=5.76s)]
*  You know anything about these drones? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=11.52s)]
*  Well, I know this, that the people telling you you have nothing to worry about are the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=13.0s)]
*  same people in charge of the border. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=18.12s)]
*  It's not so much lying, it's incompetence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=19.96s)]
*  The only way we'll ever convince the American people what's going on here is to have the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=23.56s)]
*  Trump administration level with you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=28.139999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=29.939999999999998s)]
*  I've never been more worried about an attack on the homeland than I am right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=31.779999999999998s)]
*  The border is completely broken. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=35.7s)]
*  We've got a chance to control our border early on in Congress. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=37.66s)]
*  I hope we're smart enough to take it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=41.98s)]
*  We're playing Russian roulette with our national security. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=43.82s)]
*  But this is a combination of years of being lied to and incompetency coming together. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=46.26s)]
*  Why are all these sightings in November? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=52.78s)]
*  There's something new going on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=55.5s)]
*  The people telling us about the drones have lived there all their lives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=58.3s)]
*  There's something new going on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=62.06s)]
*  What is that something new and why is it around military bases? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=64.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, okay, the governor of New Jersey, a Democrat, says they are sophisticated and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=67.98s)]
*  the moment you put eyes on them, they go dark. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=74.1s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=76.78s)]
*  Then we had another congressman say they tend to cluster and then separate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=77.78s)]
*  They'll move forward, they'll move backwards. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=83.18s)]
*  They're not the movements that an aircraft would normally make or be able to make. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  So there's something going on here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=90.48s)]
*  If it is sophisticated, it seems to me that they have to know, otherwise there would be [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=92.56s)]
*  a greater sense of urgency. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, I'd rather be lied to if the option is that they don't know, which to me would [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  be a national security disaster and failure, or they do know and just are not telling us [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=107.0s)]
*  and are lying to us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=112.0s)]
*  I'd prefer the lie part, although I don't like being lied to. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, your problem is how do you know when they're lying versus when they're incompetent? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=116.0s)]
*  When they open their mouth. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, okay, yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Is that a quiz? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  When they move their lips. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Are they lying when they open up their mouth or are they incompetent when they open up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  their mouth? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=130.28s)]
*  I mean, they told us the border was secure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=131.28s)]
*  That's clearly, that's a lie. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=133.12s)]
*  Their policies don't work and they try to tell you things that just are not credible. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=135.62s)]
*  Why is this going on now? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=140.88s)]
*  The people telling us about the drones recording this information have lived there for years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=142.38s)]
*  This is something new. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=148.56s)]
*  Something the size of a bus or an SUV is not something you buy off the shelf. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  It's not a hobby. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  So I don't want to alarm anybody. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=157.04s)]
*  I just don't buy this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't trust these people to tell me the truth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=160.26s)]
*  And I can't wait to President Trump gets in office. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=162.98s)]
*  We got to secure that border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=165.7s)]
*  We're talking about drones today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  What about terrorists on the watch list here in the largest numbers ever? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=168.9s)]
*  What about a broken border where 13 million people have come into our country? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=172.86s)]
*  What about lack of bed space to keep them in custody having to turn them loose? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=176.86s)]
*  What about the lack of agents to deport them? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=181.4s)]
*  What about building the wall? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  The number one priority of the Republican Party should be to secure your border. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=185.06s)]
*  You had a piece right before I came on saying people trust Trump, world leaders are rallying [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  around him, he has credibility. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=194.6s)]
*  Let me tell you this to the Republicans. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=196.74s)]
*  If we don't deliver on the border, we're going to lose that credibility. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=198.5s)]
*  It was the number one position of President Trump to secure our border on day one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=201.9s)]
*  If we don't do that on day one, we're making a huge mistake. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=206.9s)]
*  We'll get into more in the next segment on this, but why is Joe Biden selling off, you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=210.5s)]
*  know, the remainder of the border wall the taxpayers paid for, for pennies on the dollar, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=215.5s)]
*  knowing that Donald Trump is going to use it or wants to use it on day one? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=221.54s)]
*  And can that be stopped in your view? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=225.3s)]
*  Oh, it can be. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  I talked to Senator Cotton about this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  They're bitter. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=230.1s)]
*  They're trying to undercut Trump, building the wall, putting the technology in to secure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=231.1s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  Everything he wants to do, they're against. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=235.55999999999997s)]
*  And to the last minute of the last day, the last hour of the last day, they're going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=238.42s)]
*  try to undercut President Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  Selling off the border wall is insane. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=245.5s)]
*  We should not sell it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=248.17999999999998s)]
*  We should put it up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=249.42s)]
*  And they're making sure we have to buy it anew. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=250.82s)]
*  No respect for the taxpayer, by the way. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  Who paid for that border wall? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=255.48s)]
*  You did. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=256.98s)]
*  And they're selling it for pennies on the dollar. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=257.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  They don't want to build the wall. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  They lost the election. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to undercut the band that beat them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=262.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=265.5s)]
*  So everything that we're talking about here, kind of, very few on the left seem to understand [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=266.5s)]
*  it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=271.58000000000004s)]
*  I played the comments of Van Jones. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  And let me be clear, Donald Trump is smarter than you, me and all his critics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  And when you look at bread and butter issues, Americans don't want to pay, you know, as [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=279.42s)]
*  much as we're paying for a gallon of gasoline, they don't want high inflation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=284.98s)]
*  They don't want wide open borders. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=288.94s)]
*  They don't want to be lied to about Joe's cognitive state, the economy, borders. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=290.86s)]
*  They don't want war in Europe, and they don't want war in the Middle East, and that's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=295.98s)]
*  what they have delivered. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=299.34s)]
*  That's where the mandate comes from. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=300.34s)]
*  This is not as complicated. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=302.14s)]
*  And I'll tell you one other thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=303.58s)]
*  They don't want taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegals, and they don't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=304.94s)]
*  want woke in their public schools, and they don't want gender-affirming care without [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=308.94s)]
*  parental consent. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  You want me to keep going? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=315.5s)]
*  Well, you can go and go, but here's what you should ask the Republican Party. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=316.5s)]
*  What are you going to do about it on day one? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm working with Stephen Miller to come up with the most transformational border security [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  bill in the history of the country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  We need to change our energy policy on day one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  We need to open up American land for drilling, for oil and gas that we own to make us more [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=330.42s)]
*  energy independent. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=335.42s)]
*  We need to address inflation on day one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  We need to cut our taxes this year so they don't expire, the tax cuts don't expire. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=339.38s)]
*  I'm looking for a very aggressive agenda coming early on in 2025. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  To my Republican friends, if we don't deliver, people will turn on us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=350.62s)]
*  We got a chance to deliver. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  We better do it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEMwMNvDI4&t=356.78000000000003s)]
