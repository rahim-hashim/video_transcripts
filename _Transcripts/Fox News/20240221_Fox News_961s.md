# James Comer: Biden will go down as the most 'corrupt and compromised' president in U.S. history
**Fox News:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM)
*  Here with reaction, House Oversight Committee Chairman, James Comer, House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jim Jordan, and House Ways and Means Committee [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=4.2s)]
*  Chairman, Jason Smith. Good to see you all. All right. How would you [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=8.24s)]
*  characterize James Comer, the appearance by Jim Biden today? Did you get answers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=11.6s)]
*  that you were looking for? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=17.48s)]
*  Well, we got him on the record for a lot of things. You know, it was just [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=19.68s)]
*  striking some of the answers to some of the questions. For example, he didn't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=23.32s)]
*  realize that CEFC was affiliated with the Chinese government, even though [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=27.32s)]
*  every big company in China is affiliated with the Chinese government. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=32.92s)]
*  We realized that he even though he and Hunter Biden took took in millions and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=37.64s)]
*  millions of dollars from this Chinese Communist Party backed entity called CEFC, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=43.16s)]
*  he never provided any meaningful services back to CEFC. We learned that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=49.64s)]
*  while Joe Biden was vice president, there was another diamond that was gifted to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=55.8s)]
*  Hunter Biden. So he actually got two diamonds from the Chinese, one while Joe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=60.88s)]
*  Biden was vice president and one immediately after Joe Biden was vice [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=66.04s)]
*  president. So there were a lot of questions that we had. Jim Biden gave us [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=68.84s)]
*  a lot of answers. And now it's a matter of our next deposition with Hunter [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=74.4s)]
*  Biden. We're going to try to figure out if if in fact, Jim Biden was telling the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=81.32s)]
*  truth. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=85.88s)]
*  Let's get your take. Jim Jordan, you were there today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=87.32s)]
*  Yeah, Jim Biden and Hunter Biden kicked the rest of their business partners out [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  of the deal with CEFC and CEFC is willing to do it because of the brand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Remember, it's the money, the business, the brand. They were willing to go into [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=99.88s)]
*  business with Jim Biden, Jim Biden, who had numerous failed business adventures, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=103.8s)]
*  Jim Biden, who owed multiple people hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=108.04s)]
*  They're willing to go into business just with Hunter, just with Jim because of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=112.16s)]
*  the power of the brand, the influence with Joe Biden that that would entail. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=116.4s)]
*  They the Chinese Energy Company does that. And Sean, you're exactly right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=120.88s)]
*  Through it all, there were four fundamental facts that will never change. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Hunter Biden gets put on the board of barisma. Hunter Biden gets paid a bunch [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=128.72s)]
*  of money to do that. Second, he's not qualified to be on the board. He said so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=132.76s)]
*  himself. Third, he asked for help from this prosecutor who was applying the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=136.56s)]
*  pressure to barisma. And fourth, Joe Biden goes over there and conditions the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=139.76s)]
*  release of one billion American tax dollars on the firing of the prosecutor [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=144.0s)]
*  who was applying the pressure to the company Hunter Biden sat on the board of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=148.56s)]
*  and made a million bucks a year. That is an official action by a public official [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=152.52s)]
*  to benefit his family. And then, of course, there's the cover up that happens [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=156.6s)]
*  at the Department of Justice that two brave whistleblowers came to Jason Smith [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=160.68s)]
*  and told us about. That is the bulk of this story. And that is what we make sure [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=164.56s)]
*  we got to make sure the American people understand. Jason Smith, let's get your [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  your take on the the I guess questioning of Jim Biden today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=172.64s)]
*  Sean, all James Biden was doing today was protecting the family brand proven at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=179.28s)]
*  every step. That's what they do best. They protect the brand. They sell access to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=185.0s)]
*  the brand around the world. And I would remind the viewers the brand is President [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=190.4s)]
*  Joe Biden. We have numerous WhatsApp messages and emails provided to us by the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=194.92s)]
*  IRS whistleblowers that show James Biden was intimately involved along Hunter, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=201.24s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski, Rob Walker and others in selling access to his brothers to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=207.64s)]
*  foreigners. We even have an email, Sean, provided to us from the whistleblowers [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=212.8s)]
*  that James Biden is on showing those same business partners discussing the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  profits of a Chinese business deal, which included 20 held for James and 10 for [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=223.2s)]
*  the big guy. So for James to sit there today and say his brother had no [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=229.44s)]
*  involvement in these business dealings and no knowledge is complete hogwash on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=234.28s)]
*  Let me ask you, James Comer, he went into the LLCs in his opening statement in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=240.88s)]
*  great specificity. You've had an opportunity. You're very familiar with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=246.96s)]
*  these LLCs. You were the first to point them out right here on this program. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Were these LLCs used for any other legitimate business? Like, for example, I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=255.36s)]
*  have an LLC, an LLC, for example, I put money in, I invest money in the hope that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=260.24s)]
*  maybe I might get a return on the other side of it. But real money, real, real [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=265.12s)]
*  business activity. What were these LLCs used for? Do you see any real business [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=269.24s)]
*  activity? What services did they provide? And what did the grant? I'm dying to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=275.2s)]
*  know what the grandchildren, what did they what services did they provide to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=279.92s)]
*  get paid by these entities? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=284.76s)]
*  Well, we asked Jim Biden what exactly his various LLCs did, and he said they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=288.36s)]
*  were consulting. He was a consultant. What were you consulting? Well, he was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  consulting with American political leaders like Gavin Newsom, and he even [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=299.28s)]
*  mentioned Rick Scott, which we never could understand what he was consulting [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  with Rick Scott. But 99% of the people that he was consulting with were [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=309.11999999999995s)]
*  Democrat political leaders around the country. And he was introducing the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=314.46s)]
*  owners of CEFC to the American political establishment of the Democrat Party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=319.55999999999995s)]
*  Now, that's called lobbying. That's what a lobbyist does. And when you're doing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=326.24s)]
*  that for a foreign entity, that's called a foreign agent. Jim Biden's never in his [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=331.24s)]
*  life been a registered lobbyist, much less registered as a foreign agent. But [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=335.96s)]
*  that's what it appears his businesses did. Now, what he tried to say about all [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=340.2s)]
*  the millions he took from this Chinese Communist Party backed CEFC was he and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=345.26s)]
*  Hunter scouted out and looked for investments for the Chinese government, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=351.92s)]
*  which number one, we shouldn't have anyone affiliated with the President of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=356.88s)]
*  the United States trying to help China get their foot in the door in our [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  American economy. But that's what they were doing. But then we asked the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=364.44s)]
*  question, okay, which investments did you find for the Chinese Communist Party [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=367.88s)]
*  backed CEFC? And he said, well, we never could find any. So they were just [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=372.92s)]
*  getting paid from the Chinese government for the Biden brand. And that's what [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=376.44s)]
*  this whole scheme is about. It's an influence peddling scheme. And they were [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=383.2s)]
*  doing it with our adversaries around the world. I think the transcribed interview [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=387.0s)]
*  today with Jim Biden proved that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=391.56s)]
*  All right, let me ask you, Jason Smith, because a lot of this revolves around a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=394.8s)]
*  lot of money. James Comer has identified over $20 million worth. There are a lot [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  of people within the committee that have told me and right here on this program, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=404.28s)]
*  they believe the money might even go north of $50 million when all is said [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  and done when you find it all. But we got to start right at the big lie. The big [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=412.0s)]
*  lie was I never once spoke to my son or my brother or anybody for that matter [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=416.76s)]
*  about their foreign business dealings. Okay, then can you explain why Joe Biden [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=421.76s)]
*  was meeting with, for example, Elena Batreina, the Russian oligarch, former [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  First Lady of Moscow at Cafe Milano and other foreign business partners. Can you [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=433.92s)]
*  explain the 20 phone calls that Devin Archer testified to that Tony Bobulinski [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  clearly confirmed, I guess, in his deposition? Can you explain why that big [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=445.2s)]
*  lie does not send off sirens around the country in terms of the media coverage [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=451.0s)]
*  of something like this? Because you know, if the last name was Trump, it'd be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=456.92s)]
*  very different. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. The fact that the last name's Biden, they've been [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=462.16s)]
*  able to sell millions of dollars worth of access. That's why Joe Biden had [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=467.04s)]
*  dinner with Hunter Biden's business associates. That is why there's been [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=472.92s)]
*  numerous phone calls with Hunter Biden and James Biden's business associates is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=477.68s)]
*  because the Biden family has received multi millions, tens of millions of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=483.36s)]
*  dollars. People should be completely outraged that they have a president of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  the United States based on the facts that we have, Sean, that will probably go [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=495.44s)]
*  down as the most corrupt and compromised president in America's history. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=499.6s)]
*  Let me ask you, James Comer, because the two big, I think more flagrant examples [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=505.64s)]
*  both have to do in the energy sector, one with Ukraine and Burisma, the other [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  with CEFC and with China. Can you confirm, for example, in the case of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=515.52s)]
*  Burisma, James Comer, that in fact, in October of 2015, that it became official [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  Obama administration policy that that Ukraine had made so much progress in as [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=527.56s)]
*  it were in regards to corruption that they deserved a billion in loan [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  guarantees. That was in October 2015. By December 2015, five days before Joe went [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=536.52s)]
*  to Ukraine and leveraged that billion, that Joe Biden got a phone call from [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=543.04s)]
*  his son, Hunter, in Dubai with Burisma executives. At a time they were saying [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=547.92s)]
*  they had a D.C. problem. Five days later that Joe goes, leverages the billion. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  And son of a B, they fired the prosecutor that Burisma wanted fired. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=558.36s)]
*  And as a result of that action, as vice president, Hunter continued to get paid [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=562.88s)]
*  while addicted to drugs with no experience. Is that an accurate timeline? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=567.56s)]
*  One hundred percent. Yeah, it is, Sean. We know that that was their policy, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=573.04s)]
*  because that was the policy of the John Kerry State Department. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=576.16s)]
*  OK, so you know that was the policy and you know that that phone call happened. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=581.92s)]
*  You have no doubt about that phone call. Yes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=586.88s)]
*  All right, Jim Jordan, let me turn to you. Yeah, Deb. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  All right, go ahead. I was going to say Devin Archer. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  Devin Archer said Hunter Biden called after he got the request from the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  executives from Burisma. Hunter Biden called D.C. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  He also said Hunter Biden called his dad. He gave two answers in that deposition. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  Victoria Newland at the State Department six months before that said, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=605.8s)]
*  Victor Shokin, the prosecutor, you're doing a great job. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=609.28s)]
*  Keep up the good work. Two months before Joe Biden goes to Ukraine, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=611.76s)]
*  the Interagency Policy Committee says we think they should get the one billion [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=616.04s)]
*  dollar loan guarantee. But Joe Biden changes right when he goes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=619.64s)]
*  He makes the change. The only thing that could have prompted that change [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  is the call he got from his son. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=626.1199999999999s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, Jim Jordan, to follow up on this issue of whether or not Joe [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  Biden benefited from all of this as it relates to the CEFC. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=634.72s)]
*  It seems that Hunter Biden implicates his father a lot. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=639.32s)]
*  Sitting here with my father between everybody he knows, my ability to hold the grudge. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=642.72s)]
*  You're going to regret not not following through. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  Five days later, did they not get five million dollars sent to one of those those [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=651.36s)]
*  LLCs or shell companies? Is that true? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that confirmed? That is exactly what happened. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=658.92s)]
*  And then a few months before that, when they're trying to close the deal with CEFC, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=662.4s)]
*  Hunter Biden's been working on it for months. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=666.52s)]
*  There's a dinner at the Four Seasons in Washington, D.C. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the eight executives from CEFC, Chinese individuals there with Hunter Biden [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=671.4s)]
*  and his business associates. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=675.88s)]
*  Jim, excuse me, Joe Biden makes a drop in, stops in at the lunch, does a brief little [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=678.12s)]
*  talk to all the folks and then leaves. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=683.16s)]
*  And a few weeks later, three million dollars comes in and the agreement gets [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=685.52s)]
*  finalized. So that's the pattern, whether it's a phone call, whether it's a dinner, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=689.48s)]
*  whether it's a drop by, whether it's sitting beside Hunter Biden, we're doing a [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  WhatsApp message to the Chinese, the heads of the CEFC. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=697.0s)]
*  There's always that element there. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=700.56s)]
*  That's the brand. That's the money, the business, the brand, how this thing [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  operated. Let me ask you, Jason Smith, can you identify any services that any [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=706.16s)]
*  of the Bidens actually perform to get these tens of millions of dollars? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=711.68s)]
*  Any, anything that you know that they did for these countries that would have [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=716.5999999999999s)]
*  warranted that kind of payment? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=721.3599999999999s)]
*  All that they did was provide access to the brand, which is President Joe Biden. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=725.52s)]
*  That is what they were paying for. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's all that they delivered. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  All right. Let me ask all three of you a final question here. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=735.3599999999999s)]
*  And it has to do with the FD 1023 form and this FBI informant that was arrested. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=738.16s)]
*  Now, there's another name that I think you all recall, and his name was Christopher [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=743.68s)]
*  Steele. And Christopher Steele was the one that had the put together the Hillary [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=747.72s)]
*  Clinton bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier money she funneled through a law [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=753.0s)]
*  group to hire an op research firm that hired Christopher Steele. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=757.2s)]
*  He turned out not to be credible. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=761.44s)]
*  They, by the way, they were warned about that in August of 2016. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=763.0s)]
*  Before the 2016 election by Bruce or that it was political. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=766.52s)]
*  Don't trust it. But they did it anyway. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=770.32s)]
*  My question is now we have a guy that worked for the FBI yet again, another source [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=772.48s)]
*  that turns out to not be credible. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=778.16s)]
*  And I'd like to know what is wrong with the FBI. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  My understanding is this guy was working for the FBI as an informant for 14 years [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=783.24s)]
*  with even having authority to break the law to get to the bottom of crimes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=788.76s)]
*  I'd like to understand why the FBI keeps hiring informants that they then tell us [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  years and years later are not credible. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=799.6400000000001s)]
*  Not when it actually matters. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  Can you explain that, James Comer? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, look, with respect to the informant, all I knew about the informant was what [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=806.24s)]
*  Christopher Ray told me. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=810.7600000000001s)]
*  He said he was one of the highest paid, most trusted informants in the bureau, in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=812.0s)]
*  the entire bureau. And they had used him for over a decade and they had successfully [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=815.84s)]
*  used him in prosecuting some criminals. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  He wasn't a factor in the investigation because we didn't even know who he was. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=821.96s)]
*  We just knew that there was a 1023 that alleged Joe Biden took a bribe, which was [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  consistent with what we found in Romania and China with how the bribe was allegedly [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=832.04s)]
*  dispersed through the different shell companies in the different bank accounts. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  So obviously, we wanted to investigate it, but we never knew who the informant was. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=840.2s)]
*  All we knew of what Christopher Ray said. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=844.64s)]
*  Now we see that the FBI arrested him for lying. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=847.04s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=850.16s)]
*  It's not the same treatment that we saw when the FBI figured out that the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  Steele dossier was fictitious. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=856.56s)]
*  You know, and Jim Jordan, same question. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=860.0s)]
*  Nor does the fact that this one piece of the puzzle negate Joe's lies, negate the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=862.88s)]
*  payments, negate what you've identified as shell corporations, negate the 10 family [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=869.52s)]
*  members being paid from these foreign entities, some of our top geopolitical foes. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=874.64s)]
*  As much as I know critics of all three of yours would like to make that into the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=879.12s)]
*  biggest deal, the same people that went along with Christopher Steele's every [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=883.88s)]
*  little word written. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=888.16s)]
*  And I just want to know why they keep messing this up. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=890.28s)]
*  How is it possible that the greatest what's supposed to be the greatest? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=894.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=898.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, I was also going to say Scott Brady, U.S. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=900.3199999999999s)]
*  attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania, checked out this this [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=902.04s)]
*  confidential human source and he told us in his deposition under oath that he [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  thought this guy had the indicia of credibility. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=909.52s)]
*  He checked him out some. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=911.9599999999999s)]
*  So that's what we knew. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=912.8399999999999s)]
*  But what's interesting, Sean, is in 2016 it was a Russian operation. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=914.04s)]
*  The Trump-Russia collusion. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  We knew that was baloney. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=919.2399999999999s)]
*  Robert Mueller told us that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=920.3599999999999s)]
*  And then in 2020, the laptop was a Russian information operation. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=922.0s)]
*  That was baloney. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=925.92s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe this guy lied to the FBI. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=927.64s)]
*  Maybe it's all maybe they're right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=929.2399999999999s)]
*  But I just see a pattern that seems to be developing here over the last three [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  presidential elections. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=934.52s)]
*  I see a pattern, too. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=936.4s)]
*  And that's if you act like a nice old man, just very forgetful. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=937.6s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe that seems to be the new defense. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=942.96s)]
*  Maybe Americans will be paying attention to that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oLGsaOlYM&t=948.3199999999999s)]
