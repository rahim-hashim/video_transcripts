# Harris Faulkner previews town hall with Trump: 'It was just touching'
**Fox News:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE)
*  Now, earlier this evening in Georgia, our very own Harris Faulkner hosted an all-female [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=0.0s)]
*  town hall with former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The town hall focused on women's issues. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=8.98s)]
*  It will air on the Faulkner Focus tomorrow, 11 a.m. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=11.52s)]
*  Here's a sneak peek. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=16.04s)]
*  My son is a Georgia bulldog. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=17.04s)]
*  He was on campus the day Lakenreilly was murdered. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=20.04s)]
*  You know, terrifying for all those kids, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=22.96s)]
*  I wanted to know, like, how quickly in a sanctuary city, like they're calling Athens, Georgia, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  how quickly can you remove those threats to our societies that our children can go out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=30.56s)]
*  on a run, as they rightfully should be able to do in a park in the daytime by themselves? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=35.12s)]
*  We can do things in terms of moving people out. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=40.68s)]
*  We can move them out of the sanctuary cities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=43.26s)]
*  We're going to end all sanctuary cities in the United States, and we're going to go [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=45.16s)]
*  back to normalcy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=49.4s)]
*  And we're going to have law and order. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=51.04s)]
*  All right, here with more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=54.6s)]
*  She is the host of the hit show, The Faulkner Focus, and of course, outnumbered. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=55.88s)]
*  Our friend Harris Faulkner is back with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=61.56s)]
*  I think this is a great idea. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=63.64s)]
*  I got a lot of good feedback. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=66.56s)]
*  I know I lived in Georgia for four years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=68.16s)]
*  People that were there absolutely loved it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=71.08s)]
*  They thought it was a great town hall. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=73.44s)]
*  What was it like from your perspective? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=76.44s)]
*  How did you feel about it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=77.44s)]
*  You know, the day changed from the moment I got up in the morning with what I expected, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Sean, because I didn't know that they were going to break records and make history today [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=85.72s)]
*  with their early voting on a first day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=90.92s)]
*  And it suddenly put everything into perspective, just how close we are until Election Day, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=93.7s)]
*  really what's at stake, listening to these women, who some of them had left their jobs [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=98.6s)]
*  to be here today, because they wanted to be among a crowd asking real questions that felt [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=103.48s)]
*  like reality to them and wanting to get realistic answers, not just a pat on the head, I'm going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=109.56s)]
*  to do this, I'm going to do that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=115.08s)]
*  I mean, the talk that, the questions that came about abortion, people who are voting, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  whether they have made up their minds or not, for whomever they're voting, abortion now [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=123.0s)]
*  is in this election because the left has thought, well, that's how you reach women. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=127.2s)]
*  And so today just suddenly everything came into a different light, and it was such an [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=132.32s)]
*  intimate setting that I just know that people were edified by what they saw. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to say that it made up minds tonight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Six percent of the state of Georgia has undecided voters. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  And when you consider how tight this race was in the last election for both candidates, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  12,000 votes separated them, six percent of voters in Georgia. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Likely some of those deciders might be in that room tonight. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you this, because to me, when I think of average Americans, let's put demographics [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=165.12s)]
*  out the window. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=172.0s)]
*  Don't we all want the same thing? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=173.0s)]
*  Don't we all want law and order, safety, security? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Don't we all want a secure border? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  I think most Americans do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=179.96s)]
*  Don't we want to go to the grocery store and not have to worry about putting things on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  credit cards like so many Americans have to do? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=184.84s)]
*  Don't you want to pay less for gasoline? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=188.56s)]
*  Don't you want to know that we're not allowing unvetted people into the country? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=191.48s)]
*  Those to me are the bread and butter issues that impact families. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=197.72s)]
*  Was that a big part of this? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=200.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=202.68s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=203.68s)]
*  I mean, there were times when even the crew and I were talking after. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=204.68s)]
*  I mean, people were brought to tears by some of the questions. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=208.84s)]
*  I mean, you think you can put yourself in the place. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=212.12s)]
*  Like, that's what we do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=214.24s)]
*  We interview people, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=215.24s)]
*  And we're covering the news and we know the polls and all of that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=217.28s)]
*  But when someone can't pay for daycare and they tell a former president to the United [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=221.36s)]
*  States that they don't have the $1,400 for one child for daycare, they have to make some [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  choices in their lives like maybe I don't even go to work. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=231.8s)]
*  Maybe we just, I don't know, go on the public toll. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  What are my choices at this point? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  And the question came up during the town hall, Mr. President, is there anything that you [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  can help parents like me do to raise our children, to deal with the cost of raising children [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=243.4s)]
*  in America? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=250.8s)]
*  I mean, I was really moved and it was an intimate setting in a barn in Cumming, Georgia, which [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=251.8s)]
*  I was born about 45 minutes from here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=258.32s)]
*  So I hadn't seen this area in a very long time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=260.96s)]
*  And it was just touching. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=264.44s)]
*  It really was. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think the former president too, he didn't back away. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=267.4s)]
*  I can't wait to watch. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  You can watch Harris's and thank you, Harris, for being with us with former President Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  tomorrow morning, 11 a.m. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=278.68s)]
*  Bret Baer with Kamala Harris, 6 p.m. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=280.68s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW5_yWi7ntE&t=283.12s)]
