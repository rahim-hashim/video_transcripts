# Even Jussie Smollet couldn’t make this stuff up: Sen. John Kennedy
**Fox News:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU)
*  All right, here with more, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden says everyone's needs have been met, and Joe Biden says everybody's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=3.56s)]
*  happy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=8.8s)]
*  And, meanwhile, we know that that's a lie, just like inflation was transitory and the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=9.8s)]
*  border secure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Reaction? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=16.88s)]
*  Well, Vice President Harris and some members of the media are complaining that people are [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=18.36s)]
*  asking hard questions about the Biden-Harris recovery to Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  They say it's a new conspiracy theory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=32.16s)]
*  I'll concede that we need some new conspiracy theories, but it's because all the old ones [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=37.6s)]
*  turned out to be true. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Conspiracy theories up, something like 37 and nothing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=45.84s)]
*  Here are the facts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Helene was a monster storm. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  We saw it coming. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  The federal government had time to prepare. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=56.16s)]
*  It wasn't prepared. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  We don't have nearly enough soldiers and military helicopters rescuing people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=60.64s)]
*  During Katrina, we had 20,000 soldiers and 350 military helicopters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=68.72s)]
*  A week after the storm in Appalachia, we had, I think, 7,000 soldiers and maybe 100 helicopters. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=75.84s)]
*  And you especially need helicopters in a mountainous area. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=84.0s)]
*  Senators Budd and Tillis are so frustrated, they've asked Vice President Harris and President [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=87.76s)]
*  Biden to put an active-duty military leader in charge. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=93.6s)]
*  But so far, I don't think they've heard anything. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=97.6s)]
*  Now, in the middle of all of this, the White House—I was just going to say, in the middle [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=100.56s)]
*  of all of this, the White House sends a FEMA representative on a national talk show on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Sunday to say, stop with the hard questions. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=113.12s)]
*  It's hurting the morale of the FEMA employees. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't—even Jussie Smollett can't make this stuff up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=120.4s)]
*  I mean, most Americans who saw that interview, Sean, thought, you know, cry me a river. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=123.68s)]
*  That's what we pay you for. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=128.88s)]
*  Get your ass back to work and do your job. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=130.24s)]
*  And then, in the middle of all this, the vice president puts out this tweet that she wants [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=134.8s)]
*  to send $157 million to Lebanon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=141.92s)]
*  Lebanon is run by Hezbollah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  We're at war with Hezbollah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  If you give Lebanon money, Hezbollah will take it and use it to buy weapons to try to kill us [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=152.0s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=158.88s)]
*  There's no reward for being stupid. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=161.44s)]
*  And then, finally—you can't make this stuff up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=164.56s)]
*  Finally, the last couple of days, the vice president goes on some show called Call Her [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=167.52s)]
*  Daddy or Call Your Daddy or Who's Your Daddy or something. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=174.56s)]
*  Call Me Daddy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=179.68s)]
*  I like Who's Your Daddy better. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=180.72s)]
*  And among other things, she's talking about tampons. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=183.76s)]
*  The people in Appalachia right now don't give a function about tampons. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=189.52s)]
*  They need water. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=194.56s)]
*  They need to get out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=200.56s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=202.0s)]
*  You cannot make this stuff up, but everything I just said is factual. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, it—call me daddy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Howard Stern, who says, if you vote for Trump, you're stupid. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=209.12s)]
*  The ladies of The View that hate Trump, Colbert that hates Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  As to David Axelrod, say the quiet part out loud, well, maybe the reason is, oh, this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=217.12s)]
*  might be good for Democrats, because Republicans in North Carolina probably won't be able to vote. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=222.32s)]
*  That should be alarming to everyone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=229.12s)]
*  Well, it is alarming. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=232.72s)]
*  And, you know, what's also alarming to me? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  I guess it's the environment, when, Sean, but that's the first thing that some people think about, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  are the political ramifications. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=242.0s)]
*  That's—that triggers my gag reflex. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=244.64s)]
*  And I heard Mr. Axelrod. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=248.16s)]
*  Maybe it's taken out of context, but I don't think we ought to care about the political ramifications [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=256.24s)]
*  I think we ought to care about the Americans in trouble. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=256.64s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=260.56s)]
*  And we got to get them help. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  And they've been missing in action, and helping Lebanon over people in North Carolina is unconscionable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=263.44s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=269.68s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yf9jxsdyU&t=279.92s)]
