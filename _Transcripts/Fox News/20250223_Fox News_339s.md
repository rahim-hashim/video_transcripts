# Former DHS chief reveals 'magnet' for illegal immigration that will be removed
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA)
*  former acting GHS secretary Chad Wolf. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=0.0s)]
*  So, Chad, you had Kristi Noem's job under President Trump in his first term. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=3.68s)]
*  You know what's at stake here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm really surprised to see that the pace, which Tom Homan just said is about 94 percent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=10.16s)]
*  border crossings down, is not fast enough, and that they're replacing the acting ICE [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=16.12s)]
*  director. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=21.12s)]
*  What's different now than when we were there and I think that we got deportations down, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=22.12s)]
*  there's so much resistance by the system, by the establishment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  What do you think is different now that's enabling the pace to go so quickly? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=32.2s)]
*  Well, I think two things. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=37.08s)]
*  Primarily, the environment is different today than it was in 2017. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=40.36s)]
*  You've had four years of President Biden's disastrous border security policy, and the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=44.08s)]
*  American people want a change. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  And then two would be just the knowledge base that the Trump administration has. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  They did it for four years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=56.56s)]
*  They know it works. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  They also know it doesn't work. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=59.44s)]
*  And so what you've seen here, Kellyanne, is four weeks of unprecedented action. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=60.44s)]
*  And I see that, you know, they are moving forward on removing repatriations and deportations. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=66.0s)]
*  It doesn't appear it's going as fast as they would like, but it is well ahead of obviously [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=70.52s)]
*  where President Biden was and certainly where President Trump was in his first term. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think they're off to a good start. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=80.6s)]
*  Temporary protected status. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=83.16s)]
*  I want our viewers to hear from you, given the fact that you're acting DHS secretary, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=84.64s)]
*  what this is and what it is not, because people say, oh, my goodness, you can't take away [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=88.72s)]
*  temporary protection from people who are persecuted or who are harmed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=93.24s)]
*  This was, in the case of Haiti, it was meant to help them many, many years ago when they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=97.0s)]
*  were surviving a natural disaster, for example. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=102.6s)]
*  But it means that you are temporarily protected and don't have a right to be here otherwise [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=106.12s)]
*  but for that extenuating circumstance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=110.32s)]
*  And I saw that 17 countries were in there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=113.16s)]
*  It's being abused, in other words. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=115.24s)]
*  So can you just explain to us once and for all how it works and how it's being abused? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's absolutely being abused. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=122.6s)]
*  And the Trump team knows this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=125.88s)]
*  Look, temporary protective status is supposed to be just that, temporary in nature. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=127.28s)]
*  But what previous administrations have done, Republican and Democrats of like, has just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=131.32s)]
*  continued to extend and re-extend this designation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=135.16s)]
*  So for Haiti, for instance, it's been going on for 15 years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=140.76s)]
*  And so for 15 years, we're saying that the conditions have not improved any from the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=144.72s)]
*  earthquake that they had back in 2010. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  And so while you had 57,000 Haitians eligible for TPS in 2010, you have over 520,000 eligible [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=152.72s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=162.88s)]
*  And so what it tells you is there's been a misapplication of the law over the years, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=163.88s)]
*  and this becomes a magnet for illegal immigration, because whether you're coming from Haiti [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=170.18s)]
*  legally or illegally, TPS still applies to you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  And so it's a magnet to have folks come here illegally, hoping that they'll get TPS and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=178.46s)]
*  be able to stay here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  And so the Trump administration has said, look, we're going back to the kind of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  law. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  We're going to make sure that the application of the law is what's intended. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  It's temporary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not forever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  And they're going to eliminate that magnet for illegal immigration as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  What about Secretary Noem's action just this week, Chad Wolf, in deploying 600 folks from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  the State Department to help with the border? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is great, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=209.94s)]
*  This falls on the heels of authorizing DEA, ATF and other law enforcement agents to help [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=213.02s)]
*  ICE go out and do their job, particularly in sanctuary cities, where ICE can't go to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=219.94s)]
*  a jail setting, where they would in other cities, but they actually have to go into [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  the neighborhood. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=228.3s)]
*  So you have ICE officers going in and tracking down these criminal aliens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=230.02s)]
*  You have other law enforcement officers making sure that they're watching out for those [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  officers, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=238.46s)]
*  They're looking behind the house or behind the facility. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=239.46s)]
*  They're making sure that no one's going to interfere with the operation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  So you still have law enforcement officers, ICE officers, doing that immigration mission, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  but you're having the support of other law enforcement officers, and in this case, State [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=249.9s)]
*  Department officers, helping them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Because this is one of President Trump's top priorities, and so what you see now, very [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=257.3s)]
*  different than what you saw previously, is this is a whole-of-government effort, and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  I think they're going to be very successful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=265.36s)]
*  And in the remaining seconds we have, whole-of-government really applies to fentanyl, too. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=268.24s)]
*  I'm so glad President Trump has reintroduced that into the American lexicon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=271.56s)]
*  He's committed to getting fentanyl out of our country, law enforcement interdiction, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=275.6s)]
*  recovery and treatment, and certainly education and prevention. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=281.16s)]
*  With the time we have remaining, how successful can this actually be to get fentanyl to stop [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=285.8s)]
*  coming into our communities and our kids' veins? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=290.48s)]
*  Well, look, if anyone can do it, it's President Trump, who continues, as you said, to put [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=293.2s)]
*  this on the forefront of one of his many priorities. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=298.68s)]
*  You didn't hear President Biden at all talk about the fentanyl crisis or his solution [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=301.92s)]
*  set to it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  He almost ignored it for four years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  And what President Trump has done with the cartels and designated them as a foreign terrorist [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=308.5s)]
*  organization, he's going at the heart of the problem. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=312.52s)]
*  So whether it's the human trafficking and the illegal narcotics and the fentanyl that's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=315.08s)]
*  coming across the border, the cartels are at the heart of it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  And President Trump knows this and understands that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=321.46s)]
*  Chad Wall, former acting DHS secretary at America First Policy Institute, thank you [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=323.88s)]
*  so much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_8gRGSsoA&t=328.56s)]
