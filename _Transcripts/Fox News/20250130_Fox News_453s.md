# JD Vance: President Trump is looking after American citizens
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE)
*  And here is part two of my exclusive interview with the Vice President JD Vance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=0.0s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, I watched her yesterday. I thought she did a great job. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=5.88s)]
*  I agree. Great job. I thought a star was born and it's a very hostile room. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=9.46s)]
*  Yes it was. Well you had your moment with Margaret Brennan, although I don't think she had a very good day over the weekend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  My humble opinion. But I watched her with the media and she was very forceful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=19.92s)]
*  And then you turn over to NBC [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=25.8s)]
*  and everyone from liberal Joe to Joy Reid to Nicole Wallace and Rachel Maddow and you know it's not... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=29.96s)]
*  They're back to their closing argument in the campaign. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=36.76s)]
*  Sure. Nazi, fascist, racist, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=39.68s)]
*  And I'm like wow. It seems like they haven't learned a thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=43.56s)]
*  But here's my question. Should we... If they're going to go there and they're gonna make such insane allegations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=47.96s)]
*  When you're trying to get rid of criminals that have been murdering, raping, and responsible for other crimes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=57.44s)]
*  against violent crimes against Americans, why are they even in the White House press briefing room? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=65.44s)]
*  Why? You know what was so interesting just to give some more kudos to Caroline is she didn't have a massive binder. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=71.44s)]
*  And she did this incredible briefing with all of the hostile media and then somebody asked her where was your binder and she said my binder is in my head. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=78.44s)]
*  I think there's something very interesting about Donald Trump's approach to governance is he just wants to hire smart, competent people to do the people's business. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=85.92s)]
*  He's not worried about what you look like, whether you're gay or straight, whether you're black or white. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=93.92s)]
*  He's just saying if you're smart and you're loyal to the American people, you can have a place in my administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=98.92s)]
*  I think Caroline really knocked it out of the park. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=103.92s)]
*  But it does raise an interesting question. I actually think that we are looking very seriously about which reporters show up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=106.92s)]
*  Because if you're a reporter, even if you're biased towards the left, absolutely we want to answer your questions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=114.4s)]
*  If you're a propagandist for the Democratic Party, then we're going to treat you like a propagandist for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=119.4s)]
*  And one of the things that I think we've already done, again we're only eight days into this thing, is you know who, it's not just who's not there, it's also who is present. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=124.4s)]
*  And Caroline had a lot of new media folks, a lot of young people who represent I think the vanguard of news media in this country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=133.4s)]
*  She gave Matt Boyle from Breitbart a question yesterday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=141.88s)]
*  These are actually some of the people who are driving news in 2025 in America. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=145.88s)]
*  And I think frankly the MSNBCs, the CNNs of the world, they should take the hint. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=150.88s)]
*  Your viewership is way down. Your ratings are abysmal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=155.88s)]
*  Why is it that especially young people are tuning in to new media? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=159.88s)]
*  Maybe it's because instead of engaging in propaganda, the new media is asking real questions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=163.88s)]
*  Joe Rogan, one of the biggest voices in American media now, he was a Bernie bro eight years ago. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  This is not like some crazy right-wing guy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  This is just a person who's asking questions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately most of the old media, they're just not interested in that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  What I like about him is he's curious. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  As I listen to them and I watch Selena Gomez, that viral video of her, I'm thinking... [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh my Lord, that was embarrassing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Now I've talked to the family, as did President Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=195.84s)]
*  I know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris did not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=198.84s)]
*  I talked to Lake and Riley's family. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=200.84s)]
*  I talked to Rachel Moran's family, mother of five. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=202.84s)]
*  I talked to Jocelyn Nungarry's mother and grandfather. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=205.84s)]
*  And Mike, where were the tears when a little 13-year-old girl was brutalized and murdered [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=210.84s)]
*  and all these other Americans murdered and raped and victims of violent crime? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=217.84s)]
*  Where were the tears then? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=222.84s)]
*  That's a great point, Sean. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=224.32s)]
*  There's something very deranged in the mind of the far left in this country where I really [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=225.32s)]
*  do think that they feel more of a sense of compassion for illegal aliens who have no [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=230.32s)]
*  right to be in this country than they do their fellow citizens. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=235.56s)]
*  And that really has to change. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=238.52s)]
*  When Selena Gomez had her viral moment, and of course there were a lot of other celebrities [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=241.04s)]
*  who weighed in, I had people sending me photos of little kids, sometimes kids the same age [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=244.6s)]
*  as my little children. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=250.08s)]
*  You've got, of course, a seven-year-old, a four-year-old, a three-year-old. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a great scene, by the way, when your son's playing with your hair. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=256.64s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get to that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=257.64s)]
*  But, you know, kids similar age to my children who were murdered by criminal aliens in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=258.64s)]
*  United States of America, and as an American leader, but also just as an American citizen, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=264.8s)]
*  your compassion belongs first to your fellow citizens. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=270.64s)]
*  It doesn't mean you hate people from outside of your own borders, but there's this old [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=274.64s)]
*  school, and I think it's a very Christian concept, by the way, that you love your family, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=279.52s)]
*  and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=283.76s)]
*  your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=287.08s)]
*  the rest of the world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=293.24s)]
*  A lot of the far left has completely inverted that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=294.52s)]
*  They seem to hate the citizens of their own country and care more about people outside [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  their own borders. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=301.52s)]
*  That is no way to run a society. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=302.72s)]
*  And I think the profound difference that Donald Trump brings to the leadership of this country [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=304.74s)]
*  is that the simple concept, America first, it doesn't mean you hate anybody else. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=309.36s)]
*  It means that you have leadership, and President Trump has been very clear about this, that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  puts the interests of American citizens first. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=318.86s)]
*  In the same way that the British prime minister should care about Brits and the French should [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=321.98s)]
*  care about the French, we have an American president who cares primarily about Americans, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=325.74s)]
*  and that's a very welcome change. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=330.68s)]
*  What is President Xi doing? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=331.98s)]
*  What is the Vladimir Putin doing? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=332.98s)]
*  Xi is looking after the Chinese. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=333.98s)]
*  Putin is looking after the Russians. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=334.98s)]
*  They're entitled to do that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=336.74s)]
*  Thank God we now have an American president who's looking after the citizens of his own [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=341.86s)]
*  I hate to ask this question. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=342.86s)]
*  I really do. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=344.62s)]
*  And because of my longstanding friendship with the president, we have had two would-be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  assassins. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=353.38s)]
*  I read these reports. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  You would know a lot more about the details than I would about Iranian assassination squads [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=356.38s)]
*  in the country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  You are now, as they say, one heartbeat away from the presidency. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=363.94s)]
*  Do you think about that? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=367.46s)]
*  If God forbid that moment ever comes, then I mean God forbid. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=369.38s)]
*  Yeah, I try not to think about it, Sean. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=373.06s)]
*  My attitude is I'm going to do as good of a job as I can for the president of the United [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=375.9s)]
*  States. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  Part of that, of course, is learning from him and learning about this incredible group [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=380.38s)]
*  of people that we have in the White House. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=385.5s)]
*  And yeah, part of the job is, God forbid, if something terrible happens, I have to step [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=387.29999999999995s)]
*  into that role. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=391.38s)]
*  But I think President Trump is in incredible health. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=392.74s)]
*  I think that we've got a great situation when it comes to security around the president. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=395.44s)]
*  And I really do think that he's going to serve four years, do a great job, and I'm [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=401.12s)]
*  going to do as good of a job I can for the American people as vice president. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=404.8s)]
*  He's very low energy like Joe. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=408.16s)]
*  Oh, my Lord. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  North Carolina, Vegas, and California in a day. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, and of course, on the phone the whole time, taking calls, you know, making [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=415.8s)]
*  phone calls. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  The other thing about his energy level is he's extremely accessible, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=422.48s)]
*  And I know it's kind of shocking to the White House press corps, to everybody in Washington, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=426.72s)]
*  that the president actually is engaged in the people's government. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  That's of course exactly what you want, but it is a very radical departure from the last [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=436.6s)]
*  four years. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98Po0lWZxE&t=439.96000000000004s)]
