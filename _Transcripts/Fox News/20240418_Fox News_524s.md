# Sean Hannity: You can't make this up
**Fox News:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ)
*  Donald Trump back in court today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  All 12 jurors, plus one alternate, were selected, but not before a lot of drama when two seated [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  jurors were dismissed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=9.16s)]
*  One was let go over privacy concerns, another over a prior arrest, reportedly for tearing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=10.96s)]
*  down right-leaning political advertisements. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=16.84s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=19.04s)]
*  How did that person make it on the jury? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=20.04s)]
*  And get this, one more potential juror who was not selected from the initial pool just [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=22.2s)]
*  appeared on MSDNC to roast Donald Trump's physical appearance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=32.44s)]
*  He can't make it up, only in New York City. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=33.44s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Why were you dismissed? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=36.16s)]
*  Because I couldn't be impartial. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  You couldn't be impartial. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=38.84s)]
*  So when the judge asked that hand, can you be impartial, you raised your hand and you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=39.84s)]
*  said you cannot. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=43.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=44.2s)]
*  What was your impression of Donald Trump when you saw him? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=45.2s)]
*  You know, he looked less orange, definitely, like more yellow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=48.6s)]
*  Nothing else than that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=56.16s)]
*  He looks, he doesn't look angry or I think he looks bored, like he wants this to finish [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=59.0s)]
*  and go do his stuff. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=70.12s)]
*  This is a New York City jury pool, summoned from the voter rolls where nearly 90 percent [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=71.19999999999999s)]
*  of all voters picked Joe Biden in 2020. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=79.08s)]
*  Now, you really think that Donald Trump is able to get a fair and impartial jury in New [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=81.8s)]
*  York City? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Look at this headline. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Quote, CNN analyst says Trump wouldn't be convicted in a non-blue area case that relies [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  on a known liar, Michael Cohen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  Quote, unquote, from fake news CNN. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=97.88s)]
*  And let's not forget, the judge is a devout Democrat who donated to Joe Biden. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=100.36s)]
*  Now, the DA, meanwhile, raised money and campaign on getting Donald Trump and the charges he [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  filed are totally completely bogus, misdemeanors, well past the statute of limitations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  This entire trial, eight years later, is nothing but a sham. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  It is all designed not only to smear Donald Trump, but to take him off the campaign trail [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=121.0s)]
*  in the middle of an election and give an open field to every swing state, to one guy and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=126.28s)]
*  one guy only, and that's Joe Biden. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=131.76s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump has been told he must be in court every day or he will be sent to jail [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  in a city that doesn't even send violent people to jail. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=139.64s)]
*  And while everyone else in the case is free to say anything they want about the case, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=143.32s)]
*  Donald Trump has a gag order silencing him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  And this week, as President Trump was sitting in court, Biden spent most of his time in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=150.92s)]
*  the all-important battleground state of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=155.16s)]
*  Although there's a big problem for Joe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=158.6s)]
*  The more he campaigns, the better Donald Trump looks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=160.76s)]
*  After three days of hitting the trail, Joe did not seem to be able or up to the job of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=164.36s)]
*  being a greeter at Walmart. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=171.16s)]
*  You know those nice people you meet at the door when you come in and you say, well, where's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=173.16s)]
*  the sporting goods department or the electronics department? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=176.76s)]
*  Oh, that's right over there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=179.48s)]
*  So right there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=180.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=181.32s)]
*  Nicest people in the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=181.72s)]
*  I don't think Joe could remember where the departments are. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=183.24s)]
*  Anyway, much less president of the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=185.96s)]
*  But of course, we are getting a much different story from his campaign. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=188.68s)]
*  He feels so good about Joe and his cognitive strength and how sharp he is that they put [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=192.6s)]
*  this laughable ad together. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=198.92s)]
*  You can't make it up from the Biden campaign. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=200.76s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=203.88s)]
*  I see people going back to work, jobs coming to the area, infrastructure being fixed up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=222.6s)]
*  Joe Biden gets things done. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  Sharp as a knife. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=230.76s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=231.64s)]
*  How's his border policy working out? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=232.04s)]
*  How is Bidenomics working out? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=234.04s)]
*  How's his foreign policy working out with war in Europe and war in the Middle East? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  And of course, Joe has basically emboldened terrorists, both the terror group Hamas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=240.92s)]
*  and the terrorist state Iran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=246.12s)]
*  You sure about that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Anyway, here was Joe Biden today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=250.2s)]
*  He was at a Wawa in Philly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=252.6s)]
*  I've been to Wawa in Philly, struggling to close a takeout box and then getting quite [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=255.16s)]
*  confused while trying to order a simple milkshake. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=260.04s)]
*  Poor Joe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=263.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=263.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=266.04s)]
*  It's been a pleasure. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=266.12s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm going to pick up a few pounds here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  And I'll figure we also have QD. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Drinks for you as well, just saying, Julie. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=272.92s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=274.44s)]
*  We can take that one. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=277.48s)]
*  You take that box? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=278.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=279.64s)]
*  I'm going to go order a milkshake. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=280.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=283.0s)]
*  I'm just going to order a milkshake. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=302.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=303.96s)]
*  And it gets far worse. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=307.4s)]
*  Here's Joe trying his best to give a rousing speech to a tiny crowd in Philly. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=308.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=313.56s)]
*  The idea was we hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=315.32s)]
*  But all men and women are created equal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  The image of God deserved to be treated equal throughout their lives. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  By all the stuff we've done so far, we've done it and guess what? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=323.32s)]
*  We've cut the budget by a lot of money, $172 billion so far. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=325.96s)]
*  I see a future with the planet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=331.96s)]
*  We saved the planet as this guy busting his neck doing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=334.44s)]
*  some climate change, literally. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  Climate crisis in America. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=343.32s)]
*  Because that's America. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=345.32s)]
*  Mumbling, bumbling, stumbling, a lot of times not making sense. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=348.12s)]
*  Can you decipher every word he's saying? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=351.56s)]
*  Well, at least, and I've got to give him credit, he didn't tell the Uncle Bozy cannibalism story [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=353.88s)]
*  again. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=359.56s)]
*  In case you missed it, well, yesterday Biden told the world that his uncle was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=360.28s)]
*  eaten by Pacific Islanders, bones and all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=364.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  Because it used to be there are a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=394.6s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, turns out for real, Biden's uncle did tragically die after his plane's engines failed, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  but he wasn't eaten by cannibals. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  He drowned in the Pacific. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  There's no reason to lie and make up a story, but Joe simply cannot help himself. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=410.44s)]
*  Now, with his mind clearly deteriorating at a, well, accelerated rate, his own tall tales [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=415.8s)]
*  are among the only things he's able to talk about extemporaneously. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=421.8s)]
*  Everything else requires a note card, a teleprompter, a large font, and lots and lots of guidance [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=425.16s)]
*  from his staff, like when to pause. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  It says pause. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=432.68s)]
*  When to say, say hello. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  When to say goodbye. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=436.36s)]
*  Where to sit. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=438.04s)]
*  What type of ice cream he will get if he's a good little president. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDCiTim4YCQ&t=439.08000000000004s)]
