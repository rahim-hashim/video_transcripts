# Sean Hannity: The left is getting triggered
**Fox News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs)
*  And welcome to Hannity and yet another Action Pack Day of News, part one of the Epstein [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=0.0s)]
*  files we released. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=5.12s)]
*  The attorney general, Pam Bondi, is not happy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=6.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi now blasting bureaucrats in the FBI, not Cash Patel, for a lack of transparency [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=8.68s)]
*  after reports that a field office actually hid the documents from Bondi and newly sworn [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  in FBI Director Cash Patel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=22.92s)]
*  We've got all those details coming up tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=24.52s)]
*  So, yes, weird Tim Walz is now calling Republicans, Nazis and fascists. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=26.72s)]
*  That works so well in the campaign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=32.56s)]
*  Why would you ever want to stop? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=34.44s)]
*  No wonder why Stephen A. Smith is polling higher than, what, Kamala Harris and AOC. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=36.16s)]
*  Anyway, he'll join us with more on the dumpster fire that is his Democratic Party. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=41.56s)]
*  And is it even true that he wants to run for president? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=47.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Okay, we'll get the answer tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And then later, the mysterious tragic death legendary actor, this is sad, Gene Hackman, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=52.84s)]
*  his wife, their dog. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=57.56s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=58.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=59.56s)]
*  Are they moving at all? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=60.56s)]
*  No, they're not moving. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=61.56s)]
*  Just send somebody out here really quick. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=62.56s)]
*  Okay, my units are underway, okay? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=63.56s)]
*  All right, we've got the latest details on that tragedy coming. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=64.56s)]
*  But first more big news from the Trump White House. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=73.56s)]
*  For decades, Americans on both sides of the aisle, they have been deeply dissatisfied [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=76.92s)]
*  with the federal government, rightly so. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  In fact, nearly 40 years ago, President Reagan famously said, the nine most terrifying words [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  in the English language are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help, and I'm here [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=90.16s)]
*  to help. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, for now, for the first time, maybe ever something very special is actually happening. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  We have a free-thinking president who is working outside of the box, not within the confines [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=101.58s)]
*  of the deep state and the bureaucracy, to improve government, to be more efficient for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=107.58s)]
*  you and your family and watch out for your money and protect your rights and give you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=112.56s)]
*  more freedom. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=116.4s)]
*  None of his cabinet nominees are swamp creatures. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=117.4s)]
*  No government department is viewed as sacred. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=120.46s)]
*  All federal spending is under a microscope. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=122.78s)]
*  DOJ is an innovative new way to identify waste, fraud, abuse, corruption. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Major agencies are getting all overhauled. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=130.34s)]
*  In fact, a federal judge just ruled in favor of President Trump, allowing the State Department [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=133.26s)]
*  under Secretary of State Marco Rubio to fire CIA employees working on DEI projects. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the FBI, Cash Patel, is in the process of decentralizing the Bureau, shipping [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=145.62s)]
*  far-left agents out of D.C. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  Maybe out of the Bureau would be a good idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=154.84s)]
*  And Patel is even floating up a plan to team up with the UFC, our friend Dana White, to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=156.96s)]
*  improve fitness and training of special agents, which I know for a fact law enforcement needs [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  a lot more training. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=168.82s)]
*  Now, back at the White House, a new age of diplomacy is dawning. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=169.82s)]
*  When it comes to our allies and our adversaries, Trump is not afraid to deploy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=174.22s)]
*  America's tremendous leverage was on display yet again today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=178.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  This is indeed a unique friendship. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  It's been many years, and I think it's only gotten stronger. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=184.94s)]
*  We will make sure that it stays that way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=190.26s)]
*  We're going to have a great trade agreement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=192.98s)]
*  One way or the other, we're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  countries. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  And we're working on that as we speak. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  Tomorrow, the progress toward peace will continue when President Zelensky visits the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=202.94s)]
*  White House. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=208.42s)]
*  He'll be here tomorrow, in the early part of the day, and we'll be signing a historic [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=209.42s)]
*  agreement that will make the United States a major partner in developing Ukraine's minerals [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=214.0s)]
*  and rare earths and oil and gases. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=219.22s)]
*  And we have a great understanding. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=223.98s)]
*  I think it's going to be great for Ukraine. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=226.9s)]
*  But the media was telling us, oh, but he's being mean to Zelensky. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=229.86s)]
*  No, it's called negotiating and hopefully ending war in Europe. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=232.74s)]
*  Despite what you might hear on fake news CNN, MSDNC, President Trump earned the respect [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=237.22s)]
*  of world leaders. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=242.3s)]
*  And here's more from Trump's joint presser with Britain's prime minister. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=243.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=247.12s)]
*  Mr. President, I welcome your deep and personal commitment to bring peace and to stop the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=248.58s)]
*  killing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=254.14s)]
*  You've created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal, a deal that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=255.14s)]
*  I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=261.82s)]
*  That is the prize. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=266.58s)]
*  And we hope it comes to fruition. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=269.26s)]
*  Things are looking good. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=271.1s)]
*  We'll see over time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=272.1s)]
*  Give President Trump time to negotiate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=273.7s)]
*  To put it bluntly, Trump is seeking out good deals for the American people, free and fair [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  trade, reciprocity if they put tariffs on us, and peace around the world. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=281.02s)]
*  What a horrible thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=286.26s)]
*  What a horrible human being he must be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=287.26s)]
*  But many on the left, they're deeply upset. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=289.46s)]
*  They are triggered. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  They are angry. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  They're currently trashing everything Donald Trump says or does. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  One New York Times columnist just compared Trump to Putin. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=297.55999999999995s)]
*  A little left-wing publication accusing Trump of building a new axis of evil with America [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=301.1s)]
*  front and center. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=305.94s)]
*  Illinois gluttonous governor said that prices are going up because Donald Trump is destroying [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=307.22s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=312.54s)]
*  Didn't they try that in the campaign? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=313.54s)]
*  How'd that play out for them? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  If you talk to 100 people, knock on 100 doors, and I've knocked on an awful lot of doors [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  running for office, and you say to people, you know, democracy is at risk, nobody knows [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=323.06s)]
*  what that looks like. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=328.22s)]
*  They've never experienced it before. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  And the reality is what people need to hear about is what the effects of that are. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=331.66s)]
*  The prices at the grocery store are going up because democracy is being taken away. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=336.62s)]
*  Governor, you said that before the election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=343.42s)]
*  All you Democrats are saying that before the election. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=346.82000000000005s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=350.18s)]
*  Democracy won. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump won. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=353.26000000000005s)]
*  The American people chose. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=354.48s)]
*  Now, when you think it can't possibly get any more absurd than that, I present to you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=356.22s)]
*  the ladies of the possibly soon-to-be-cancelled ABC Disney show The View. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  This is supposed to be that hard-hitting new show, ABC Disney, but today, well, I don't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=368.5s)]
*  know what to tell you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  Joyless Behar turned into a full-blown anti-immigrant xenophobic conspiracy theorist by attacking [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=381.54s)]
*  Who would have thunk it? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=382.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=383.54s)]
*  The guy was not born in this country, who was born under apartheid in South Africa, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=384.86s)]
*  so has that mentality going on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=390.94s)]
*  He was pro-apartheid, as I understand it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=392.62s)]
*  This is just perfectly wonderful for Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=395.1s)]
*  He's been taking a nap and let this foreign agent, you know, an enemy of the United States, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  do his job. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  Now I'm getting some flak because I said that Musk was pro-apartheid. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't really know for sure if he was. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=408.94s)]
*  He grew up at that time when the apartheid was in full bloom before the great Nelson [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=410.62s)]
*  Mandela fixed that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  He was around at that time, but maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  He might have been a young guy, too. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=420.38s)]
*  Might have been. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=421.7s)]
*  So don't be suing me, okay, Elon? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=422.7s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=424.7s)]
*  Anyway, not to be outdone, her co-host Whoopi Goldberg made a false accusation of her own. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=426.7s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=431.14s)]
*  I wouldn't be listening to this man if I thought he had one iota of medical experience. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=432.74s)]
*  He doesn't know he's fired everybody. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=440.14s)]
*  Where are the scientists? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  You fired all the damn scientists. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=443.82s)]
*  You got rid of this one. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=445.7s)]
*  You got rid of that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=446.7s)]
*  Who is checking? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=447.7s)]
*  Well, they vilified the scientists. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=448.7s)]
*  Look what they did to Dr. Fauci. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=450.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=451.5s)]
*  I mean, they go after scientists. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=452.5s)]
*  Dr. Fauci? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=454.5s)]
*  You mean the guy that said if you got the shot that you're not going to get COVID and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=456.58s)]
*  you're not going to infect others? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  That guy? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  After so many years, you would think that the left would develop just a little bit of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=462.62s)]
*  Little introspection, maybe a course adjustment. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=467.58s)]
*  The sky is not falling. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  Democracy is not in peril. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=472.7s)]
*  America is not on a war path. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=474.26s)]
*  I understand. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=475.7s)]
*  I will try to be sympathetic. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=477.58s)]
*  I will try to cater to the pain that you must be going through. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=479.5s)]
*  Change can be hard. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  And that out of the box thinking is not always welcome. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=485.7s)]
*  And it's scary, very scary to myopic institutionalists like the hosts of The View. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=488.82s)]
*  But so many Americans across our great country, and we've been showing polls a lot of nights, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=494.14s)]
*  have been failed by decades of government incompetence over spending, over regulation, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=498.82s)]
*  corruption, intrusion into their lives. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=505.34s)]
*  In November, voters, they picked someone who would take a wrecking ball to the Washington [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=507.46s)]
*  swamp. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=511.9s)]
*  That's what Trump is doing in a good way. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=512.9s)]
*  If you're a devout Democrat with Trump derangement syndrome and you want to keep building the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=515.3s)]
*  You don't have to like Trump or agree with everything he does. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  But at this point, the hate, the hysteria is beyond insufferable. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=524.2600000000001s)]
*  And the American people, frankly, they're going to get sick of it real quick. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53lnvilhBs&t=529.1800000000001s)]
