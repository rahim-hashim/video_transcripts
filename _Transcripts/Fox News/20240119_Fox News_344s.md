# Hannity: This is a scary scenario for the world
**Fox News:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=0.0s)]
*  So we are at the end of a very busy week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  No one's happier, by the way, than President Joe Biden. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  He now gets to spend more quality time resting and relaxing at his home in Delaware. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=9.4s)]
*  Now, of course, it has not been a very busy week or month, for that matter, for Joe Biden. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=14.4s)]
*  Now, yesterday, he completed just his fifth public event in the last 27 days, according [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=19.84s)]
*  to RNC Research. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=26.28s)]
*  It was a short trip to North Carolina, where he attempted to talk about high-speed internet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=28.4s)]
*  Well, instead, Joe got dazed and confused, as usual, onstage, randomly starting to ask [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=33.44s)]
*  for someone named Deborah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=42.28s)]
*  Deborah wasn't there, but he thought he had just taken a picture with Deborah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=44.4s)]
*  Maybe he just simply imagined it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=48.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=50.04s)]
*  I also want to mention Congressman Deborah Ross. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=51.04s)]
*  Where's Deborah? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=53.8s)]
*  This year, I just had a picture taken with her. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=55.4s)]
*  That's probably why she left. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=59.16s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=60.16s)]
*  Anyway, you can—oh, she couldn't be here, actually. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=61.16s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  I got mixed up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  And she has—you know, she fights very hard for the people of this district, and she's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  up in Washington right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=73.0s)]
*  Joe is often mixed up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, he's not well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=77.72s)]
*  Let's just be dead honest here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=79.32s)]
*  This man is not well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=81.08s)]
*  It's sad for him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=82.64s)]
*  It's sad that nobody in his life will intervene. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=84.32s)]
*  It's also scary for all of us, everybody in the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, it's a scary scenario for the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=90.72s)]
*  The president of the United States of America clearly does not have the cognitive bandwidth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=93.56s)]
*  to do any job. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he could be a Walmart greeter for that matter, much less serve as the leader [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=102.28s)]
*  of the free world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=108.38s)]
*  And he's now running for reelection. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=110.16s)]
*  This is the definition of insanity. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=112.32s)]
*  Now, to be fair, Biden didn't just give a speech in North Carolina. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  He also visited the delicious Greensboro-based chain Cook Out, where he enjoyed some ice [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=118.24s)]
*  cream. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  It's Joe's big reward for a hard day's work. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  This is such a ridiculous game that Democrats are now playing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  They drop Biden out in front of a small crowd of hand-selected guests every few days. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=131.04s)]
*  They carefully guide him onto the stage. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=136.88s)]
*  The fewer steps, the better. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=139.44s)]
*  Somebody's on standby to walk him off stage left or stage right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=141.44s)]
*  They load a short script into the teleprompter with the biggest font possible, obviously [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=145.2s)]
*  written by a staffer that Biden probably doesn't even know or remember. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=150.2s)]
*  And then finally, they all cross their fingers, and they're hoping and praying that Joe Biden [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=154.32s)]
*  can make it through the speech without botching it up that badly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=160.12s)]
*  We're all supposed to, what, pretend that this is normal, that this is OK, that this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=163.4s)]
*  is fine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=168.36s)]
*  Your president is running on empty. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=170.04s)]
*  As a result, our country is being run into the ground by woke, entitled, radical socialists [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  who spend their entire lives in and around the Washington swamp and have zero understanding [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=180.2s)]
*  of the real world. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=186.2s)]
*  You know, this is one of the major reasons why multiple polls show Donald Trump beating [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=187.2s)]
*  Biden in a hypothetical matchup. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=193.04s)]
*  The latest messenger, Harris Poll, has trumped up by 11 with independent voters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=196.0s)]
*  Another major reason for Trump's polling edge appears to involve the many legal cases [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=201.6s)]
*  against him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=207.04s)]
*  Americans now rightfully view Donald Trump as being politically persecuted, facing off [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=208.04s)]
*  against an abusively biased system that's corrupted by partisan bureaucrats. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=213.56s)]
*  For example, Fulton County DA Fannie Willis now attempting to prosecute Trump for more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  than a dozen felonies, RICO charges, racketeering, a charge, by the way, normally used for organized [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  crime, including drug dealers and gang members and the mafia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  In order to pull that off, this aggressive prosecution, Willis used a massive amount [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  of taxpayer funding to hire outside attorneys, some guy named Nathan Wade. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=240.56s)]
*  Now according to allegations from a divorce proceeding, Willis was having an affair with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=246.6s)]
*  this lawyer and going on trips and tropical vacations with the lawyer, who was being paid [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=251.32s)]
*  an obscene amount of money. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=257.92s)]
*  The pair were even traveling together during their investigation into Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=259.76s)]
*  Now, of course, this is all, you know, seemingly financed by $654,000 that Fannie Willis' [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=263.84s)]
*  alleged boyfriend earned from the taxpayers in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=271.64s)]
*  And to make matters worse, this guy has very limited experience prosecuting criminals outside [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  of his work with traffic citations. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=282.32s)]
*  So you got to ask, what's going on here? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=285.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's obvious to connect the dots, but as we speak, Fannie Willis, you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=287.2s)]
*  know, beyond playing the race card, is desperately trying to squash this subpoena related to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=292.08s)]
*  this alleged misconduct, all while refusing to confirm or deny her inappropriate affair [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=298.0s)]
*  allegations with a special prosecutor that she hired and paid the obscene amount of money [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=303.92s)]
*  to and went on vacation with. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=308.6s)]
*  Once again, the very same people, the ones that proclaim, no one is above the law, they [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=311.04s)]
*  seem to think they themselves are above the law, when in reality, many of these prosecutors [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  are nothing but political hacks motivated by fame and fortune and an unyielding hatred [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=321.68s)]
*  for all things Trump, and of course, they desire power. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=328.36s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThhUrbRSSs&t=331.52000000000004s)]
