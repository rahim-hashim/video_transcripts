# ‘IN SHAMBLES’: Democrats are humiliating themselves daily, Hannity says
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=0.0s)]
*  What a busy Friday news night. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=1.32s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert moments ago. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=2.92s)]
*  President Trump revoked Joe Biden's security clearance and stopped his daily intelligence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=5.38s)]
*  briefings on truth social. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=10.06s)]
*  President Trump, he posted the following. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=12.66s)]
*  Biden set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the intelligence community to stop [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  the 45th president of the United States, me, from accessing details on national security, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  where courtesy provided to former presidents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=27.42s)]
*  The Her report revealed that Biden suffers from poor memory and even in his prime could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=29.94s)]
*  not be trusted with sensitive information. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  I will always protect our national security. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=37.46s)]
*  Joe, you're fired. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=39.86s)]
*  Tonight, President Trump is absolutely right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  Now, in case you think, oh, this is outrageous. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=44.3s)]
*  Oh, I can't believe Donald Trump did this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=47.14s)]
*  Okay, let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=50.34s)]
*  I'm sure the fake news legacy media mob, state run as it is, is not going to show you [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=53.3s)]
*  this headline from The New York Times. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=60.74s)]
*  We'll remind you, 2021. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=62.46s)]
*  As you can see right there, Biden bars Trump from receiving intelligence briefings, citing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=64.78s)]
*  erratic behavior. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=69.62s)]
*  Anyway, Biden set the precedent in 2021. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=71.34s)]
*  Joe is obviously in a steep cognitive decline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=74.34s)]
*  And frankly, after all we know about what he did in leveraging a billion dollars, barisma [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=77.86s)]
*  and Hunter's laptop saying that he paid Pops all this money, I think Donald Trump made [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=82.82s)]
*  the right decision. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=87.62s)]
*  Of course, we would also hate for classified information to end up in Biden's garbage [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=88.62s)]
*  next to his precious Corvette or in a cardboard box. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=93.42s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Democratic Party is in shambles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=97.1s)]
*  Not long ago, they lost the White House, the House, the Senate, and now they are humiliating [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=100.14s)]
*  themselves. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  I'll admit, it's somewhat entertaining in public and they're doing it daily. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  A few hours ago, with the cameras rolling, congressional Democrats, look at this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  They attempted to storm the Department of Education building in D.C. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=115.46s)]
*  Now this performative stunt was supposed to be a protest against that evil monster who's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  helping to save you money, Elon Musk and Doge. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  But instead, they spent several minutes harassing a poor security guard at the front door of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=130.74s)]
*  the building. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=134.82s)]
*  This is your modern, leftist, extreme, radical Democratic Party. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Take a good look. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=140.38s)]
*  Department of Education, get a good copy of him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=170.38s)]
*  Let him get recorded in history for what he's doing today. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  Let his children see him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=179.1s)]
*  Let his children know that he was standing in the way of all children being educated. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=181.1s)]
*  Look them in the eye. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=188.1s)]
*  Come on, hold your face up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=189.1s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=191.1s)]
*  Let him see you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=192.1s)]
*  That looked like a threat to me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=194.1s)]
*  Oh, everybody in the world, look at this individual. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=196.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  Shock, denial, depression, and now we can expect four years of irrational rage. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  Just so we are clear, Democrats say they are embarrassing themselves in a desperate attempt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=207.22s)]
*  to stop Trump and Elon Musk from protecting your money, auditing the federal government, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=211.5s)]
*  eliminating massive waste, fraud and abuse, tens, likely hundreds of, not millions, billions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  of your hard-earned tax dollars wasted on foreign countries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  We have needs galore in this country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=230.5s)]
*  Why aren't we helping Americans out? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=233.06s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  Because they want to spread the gospel of Green New Dealism, wokeism, transgenderism, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  DEI, while simultaneously failing spectacularly you, the American people, the average American [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  that makes $66,000 a year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  So now Democrats are dead set against any kind of government accountability? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=249.88s)]
*  Just moments ago, President Trump, he just responded. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=254.1s)]
*  Imar Olajko, take a look. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=257.02s)]
*  The Democrats have lost their minds and they've lost their confidence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=259.3s)]
*  They have very little confidence. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  They are different people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=263.66s)]
*  And they look foolish. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=266.18s)]
*  Today, they tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=267.18s)]
*  check the books. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=271.02s)]
*  And Maxine Waters is a lunatic. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=272.98s)]
*  And you know, they're all lunatics, frankly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=275.1s)]
*  It's so sad to see. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=278.46000000000004s)]
*  They should be happy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=280.18s)]
*  They shouldn't be sad. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=281.18s)]
*  Look at this man. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=284.82s)]
*  Do you—you know, who are you? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=285.82s)]
*  Get out of my way. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  Is that how you treat security guards? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Keep in mind, the Department of Education was created by Jimmy Carter. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=291.5s)]
*  It's not that old. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  And it is a massive failure. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=296.66s)]
*  We spend more per capita as an industrialized country than any other industrialized country [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=298.76s)]
*  with the worst results. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=303.82s)]
*  And under the department, America's education standards have steadily declined. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=305.86s)]
*  We are failing our children. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=310.42s)]
*  But apparently, Democrats care more about government and big spending and spending abroad [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=312.52s)]
*  than results for we, the American people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  Just look at this article from The Washington Post. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=321.46s)]
*  The headline reads, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump 2.0, the most dangerous first two weeks in presidential history. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  No hyper-purbily there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=330.08s)]
*  It continues, Trump, his second term, is all about curtailing government's power and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=332.08s)]
*  reach. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd say that's great. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd say that's the most consequential, transformational two weeks in presidential [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=339.92s)]
*  history. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  How do you see things so differently? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  How do you—how do you juxtapose those interpretations? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=346.92s)]
*  Anyway, the left, they worship government like a religion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=350.8s)]
*  The last thing you should count on in government. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=354.36s)]
*  How's government—how's government doing protecting your towns and your cities with [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=356.68s)]
*  defund dismantled? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=360.72s)]
*  Have they done a good job protecting your border? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=361.72s)]
*  How's your educational system in your small town or big city? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=364.48s)]
*  Have they done a good job educating your kids? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  How's that Obamacare thing working out? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=371.44s)]
*  Keep your doctor plan and save $2,500—no, that's right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=373.32s)]
*  Millions lost their doctors, their plans, and we're paying about 300 percent more. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=377.92s)]
*  They have corruptly abused your hard-earned money, the money of the American people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=382.16s)]
*  They have stolen money from our children and our grandchildren in the process. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=388.16s)]
*  And of course, many on the left benefited from a pretty extensive gravy train, because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=393.6s)]
*  that's their power base. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=398.64s)]
*  But thank you, Elon Musk and Doge. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  USAID was totally exposed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=403.24s)]
*  We now know the agency was showering left-wing organizations worldwide with cold, hard cash. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=406.52s)]
*  Compliments of you, but you didn't know about it because they weren't transparent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=412.68s)]
*  and they hid it from you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  And now USAID appears to be out of business. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=418.44s)]
*  Today, the signage, it was removed from the building, and Trump plans to cut USAID staff [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=421.48s)]
*  by 97 percent pending a new lawsuit. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  In a post on X, Doge announced that USAID is now unburdened by what has been and buckle [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=437.52s)]
*  This is only one agency. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=438.52s)]
*  This is only the beginning. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=440.67999999999995s)]
*  And this is the beginning of the left and their daily, hourly, minute-by-minute freakout. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=442.88s)]
*  Elon Musk and his team, frankly, we owe them a debt of gratitude. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=448.64s)]
*  They're on the case throughout the entire federal government. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=453.12s)]
*  For example, Doge just announced that it found a dozen people receiving Social Security. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  OK, that sounds—oh, but they're 150 years old. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=461.76000000000005s)]
*  Hmm, government efficiency at its best. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=466.24s)]
*  And in the past 48 hours, thanks to Doge, the Department of Health and Human Services [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=469.16s)]
*  has canceled $182 million in administrative expenses, including a $168,000 contract for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=473.8s)]
*  an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the NIH museum. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=488.68s)]
*  You got to be kidding. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=491.08s)]
*  Doge is also auditing the Consumer Bureau, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, with plans [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  to fully examine the Department of Education, the Pentagon, and, according to President [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=498.4s)]
*  Trump, they're going to go through everything. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=502.96s)]
*  And by the way, they should literally turn over every penny, every nickel, before they [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=505.2s)]
*  spend your money. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=510.0s)]
*  If Democrats were smart, if they were honest, if they were not corrupt, they would cheer [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=511.6s)]
*  for what is happening, what Elon Musk and his team are doing at Doge. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=515.92s)]
*  They are returning America to its constitutional order. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=519.8s)]
*  What our framers and founders envisioned—limited government, greater freedom, eliminating waste, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=524.32s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=529.96s)]
*  Republicans have lectured us about this for years. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=531.2s)]
*  Now they have a chance to actually do the job. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=533.6s)]
*  And by the way, it shouldn't be a partisan issue. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=536.2s)]
*  We should be good stewards of taxpayer money. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=539.06s)]
*  The Democratic Party is such a pathetic, self-righteous trainwreck that they're willing to attack [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  anything and everything that Donald Trump supports, whether it's common sense or not. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=546.62s)]
*  It's not going to matter. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=551.22s)]
*  They lost. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=552.46s)]
*  Trump won. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=553.46s)]
*  And now the swamp is getting drained, one way or another. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlKLWz7ypM&t=554.46s)]
