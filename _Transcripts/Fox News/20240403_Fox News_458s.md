# Sean Hannity: This is a tipping point for the country
**Fox News:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54)
*  But first, it is a tough pill to swallow for so many on the left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=0.0s)]
*  You see that? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=4.32s)]
*  215 days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=5.32s)]
*  This is an inflection point for this country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=6.84s)]
*  This is a tipping point for this country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=9.28s)]
*  There is a very real possibility that Donald J. Trump can be your president-elect. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=11.6s)]
*  Anything can happen in 215 days, but Trump is now consistently pulling ahead of Biden [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=17.04s)]
*  in almost every single battleground state, according to a brand-new Wall Street Journal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=22.8s)]
*  poll just out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=27.96s)]
*  Well, Trump is leading in six out of seven swing states, up by five in the important [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  state of Arizona, four in Nevada, three in Michigan, three in Pennsylvania, one in Georgia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=34.48s)]
*  That needs to get larger. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  Six in North Carolina and in the seventh state, Wisconsin. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=43.4s)]
*  Trump and Biden are tied. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=47.44s)]
*  Let us be clear, very clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  These results are not unusual. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=51.36s)]
*  In poll after poll, President Trump is beating Biden nationwide and beating him in what we [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=54.18s)]
*  believe will be the key swing states. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=59.68s)]
*  But according to Dr. Jill Biden, well, the polls don't really exist. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=62.06s)]
*  They are but a mere figment of your imagination. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=67.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=71.3s)]
*  People know the choice this election. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=72.3s)]
*  They can choose chaos or they can choose, you know, steady wisdom experience. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  So— [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=79.9s)]
*  Is not a part of you that's a little worried? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=80.9s)]
*  No. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=82.38s)]
*  No, I feel that Joe will be reelected. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=83.42s)]
*  But when these polls like the Wall Street Journal one land in the White House and he's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=86.33999999999999s)]
*  losing in all the battleground states— [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=89.46s)]
*  No, he's not losing in all the battleground states. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  He's coming up and he's even or doing better. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=93.42s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=97.58s)]
*  Once people start to focus in and they see their two choices, it's obvious that Joe [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=99.14s)]
*  will win this election. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  I was wondering, maybe you were wondering the same thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=108.06s)]
*  Where was Joe Biden during that discussion? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=111.26s)]
*  Now, according to RNC Research, think about this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=113.14s)]
*  It has been a whopping 279 days since President Joe actually participated in a real live sit-down [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=116.5s)]
*  interview. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=124.66s)]
*  In other words, Joe is back hiding in his basement with a few campaign visits and a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=125.66s)]
*  lot of fundraisers sprinkled in here, there when they can. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, it's not because he doesn't have the time, because Joe frequently spends entire [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  without anything on his public calendar. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=139.34s)]
*  This lie the White House has been telling us, he gets more done in an hour than most [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=142.02s)]
*  Americans get done in a day. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=148.38s)]
*  Anyway, it's pretty unheard of, that light schedule for any president, especially if [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=149.38s)]
*  you're running for reelection. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=153.22s)]
*  Now, even when Joe does have a teleprompter and a friendly audience, it is, well, always [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=154.62s)]
*  a struggle. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=160.3s)]
*  Here is but the latest example of your president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=161.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=164.22s)]
*  I'm proud. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=165.46s)]
*  I'm proud of my administration has taken on Big Pharma in the most significant ways ever. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=166.46s)]
*  And I wouldn't have done without Bernie. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=172.86s)]
*  And Bernie got it, you know, look. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=174.34s)]
*  But the Republicans were able to cut back on the fact that only they only were not able [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=176.78s)]
*  the only thing they couldn't defeat was seniors. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=181.34s)]
*  It cuts the deficit by $160 billion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=184.3s)]
*  Now, this spring is here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=188.9s)]
*  The seasons or analogies are on upon us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=192.66s)]
*  For the mumbling, bumbling, stumbling, incoherence, I think I need an interpreter because he's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=196.46s)]
*  now attempting to navigate what has become an increasingly difficult political landscape. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=201.38s)]
*  The numbers are very clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=207.14s)]
*  They're very consistent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  James Carville says they are horrific, horrendous. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=209.7s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, all turning on Biden because of what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=213.74s)]
*  This border disaster, horrible economy and inflation, violent crime. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=219.34s)]
*  People don't have law and order and safety and security. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=224.22s)]
*  And at the same time, the president's very woke base. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=227.26s)]
*  They are demanding even more illegal immigration, more spending, more defund, dismantle, reimagine [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=230.34s)]
*  the police and no bail laws. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=237.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden's support among Muslim voters, that is now bottomed out because [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=239.7s)]
*  quote his assistance to Israel in its war against terrorism in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  As a result, by the way, Joe Biden keeps literally abandoning our number one ally, Israel, as [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=251.94s)]
*  they are in a real fight for their very survival. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=258.5s)]
*  If you have friends like Joe, you don't need friends like that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=262.7s)]
*  But it's critical, critical voting block in states like Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=265.86s)]
*  They are demanding that Joe capitulate to the radicals that run his party. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=270.98s)]
*  In fact, during last night's Democratic primary in the Badger State, take a look at this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=275.7s)]
*  More than 40,000 uninstructed ballots were cast, in part, at least to protest the fact [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=280.78s)]
*  that Biden kind of helped Israel a little, but he's really been stabbing them in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=288.42s)]
*  back the entire time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=294.18s)]
*  Now that's more than enough votes to swing the general election in the tightly contested [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=296.3s)]
*  state of Wisconsin. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=301.24s)]
*  And let's not forget, Biden is now also forced to contend with an independent challenge [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  from the left, as R.F.K. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=308.02s)]
*  Jr. looks poised to siphon off a considerable amount of that vote. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=310.02s)]
*  By the way, we've done a full vetting of Robert Kennedy Jr. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=314.26s)]
*  I actually like the guy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=317.94s)]
*  He's no conservative. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  We will go through that in detail. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, of course, the president, his supporters will have plenty of money to spend, much of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=322.17999999999995s)]
*  it from anonymous donors and super PACs. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=326.58s)]
*  Remember, Biden once bashed, you know, so-called dark money raised by political action committees. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=330.06s)]
*  Quote, he said, there's too much money that flows in the shadows to influence our elections [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=335.5s)]
*  and it erodes public trust. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=340.94s)]
*  Exactly what he's doing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=343.54s)]
*  Now, in case if you're wondering, Joe does not apply the same standard to himself. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=344.54s)]
*  The super PAC that is bolstering his reelection, they have raised millions in dark money from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=349.5s)]
*  anonymous donors. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=354.82s)]
*  Now, Trump and the RNC, meanwhile, get this, and everyone had been writing them off as [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=357.06s)]
*  dead, gone and buried. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=362.06s)]
*  They raised a whopping $65 million in March. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=363.94s)]
*  None of it was dark money. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=368.9s)]
*  Now, clearly, as Biden is struggling in the polls, all of his holier-than-thou proclamations [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=370.38s)]
*  have gone by the wayside. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=375.86s)]
*  Remember, he once promised unity nowhere to be found. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  His goal to bring back, quote, decency to the White House? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=381.3s)]
*  OK, that's his last, probably as laughable as what, Hunter Biden's art career and his [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  pledge to empower an independent judiciary. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=391.42s)]
*  That was a flat-out lie. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=394.22s)]
*  Biden even reportedly demanded that his own DOJ investigate and prosecute his chief political [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=395.5s)]
*  rival, and they're doing it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=402.22s)]
*  The DOJ then dutifully is doing their job. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=404.1s)]
*  In November, you, you have the opportunity to elect somebody that would be far more authentic [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  with a much better track record, who is clearly a fighter for this country that will reestablish [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=413.98s)]
*  America's strength on the world stage, that understands the needs to control our borders, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=420.34s)]
*  bring back law and order and safety and security, and, by the way, ran a much better economy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=426.58s)]
*  than Joe Biden ever dreamed of. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=431.38s)]
*  And that's, that's going to be the difference in just 215 days. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=433.48s)]
*  Now, by the way, or you can treat it like a retirement house, like Joe does, the White [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=437.18s)]
*  House in between trips to Delaware. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrcRgO0g54&t=443.14s)]
