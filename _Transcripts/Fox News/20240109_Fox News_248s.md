# Sen. John Barrasso endorses Donald Trump: 'We need him back in the White House'
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y)
*  All right, joining us now with more, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And by the way, apparently, ready to make an announcement. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=3.36s)]
*  Senator, I'm told you have told nobody about this coming announcement. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=6.2s)]
*  We're glad you chose this show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=12.44s)]
*  It's great to have you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=13.44s)]
*  We love the people of Wyoming, except maybe we're a little mad at the Cheneys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=14.44s)]
*  But short of that, we like everyone else. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=17.6s)]
*  What are you—what's on the agenda tonight? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=20.48s)]
*  Well, the people of Wyoming and, of course, all your viewers know that the country was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=22.84s)]
*  much better off under President Donald Trump, and Joe Biden continues to fail America. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=26.32s)]
*  You know, when President Trump was in office, we had the best economy in my lifetime. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=31.6s)]
*  In most of our lifetime, we had energy independence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=36.04s)]
*  Our enemies feared us, and we had a secure border. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=39.2s)]
*  And now under Joe Biden, we have high prices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  We have a wide open border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=44.64s)]
*  This—what's happened at the border, the surrender at the border has allowed 8 million [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=46.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants into the country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=51.96s)]
*  Joe Biden goes and begs our enemies for fuel and energy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=54.32s)]
*  This is a disaster. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=58.78s)]
*  We cannot afford another four years of Joe Biden's failure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=59.78s)]
*  So if you want to get the country back on track, which is what I want to do, we need [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=64.16s)]
*  a strong Republican conservative House and Senate, and we need Donald Trump back in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=68.44s)]
*  White House. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=73.88s)]
*  And that's why tonight I am endorsing Donald Trump for president of the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=74.88s)]
*  Well, we appreciate you picking our show to tell people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=79.56s)]
*  I will tell you this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=83.88s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, because I get asked a lot of questions by people about Donald [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=84.88s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=88.72s)]
*  And why does he fight so much? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=89.72s)]
*  Why does he fight so much? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=91.32s)]
*  And he has a good answer, I think. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=92.32s)]
*  And it's that, well, if he didn't fight, he wouldn't survive, number one. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=94.28s)]
*  But his real fight is on the issues you're talking about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=97.72s)]
*  This is a guy that is going to fight for the things that work, fight for a better economy, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=101.74s)]
*  free and fair trade deals, secure borders, energy independence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=106.84s)]
*  There wasn't any one of those issues, when he was president, that was an easy lift. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=110.96s)]
*  What do you make of the never-ending, nonstop, unrelenting attacks and now the use of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=115.88s)]
*  legal system now attempts to—he's never been charged with insurrection, but they want [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  to take him off the ticket. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=129.68s)]
*  They don't even want people to have a chance to vote for him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=131.24s)]
*  How is that going to play out? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=133.84s)]
*  Very poorly for them, well for President Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  They cannot continue to do this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=139.2s)]
*  It's not working for them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=140.92s)]
*  They know Joe Biden is a weak president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  But on the bigger question of are you better off now than you were four years ago, people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=144.72s)]
*  overwhelmingly are worse off now than they were four years ago, which is why Americans [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  are turning to Donald Trump for president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=153.64s)]
*  He is the person—Joe Biden has done massive damage to this country, to our border, to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=157.04s)]
*  our economy, to our standing in the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=161.76s)]
*  He is weak. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  He's not up to the job. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  When I look at Donald Trump, and I was with him in Afghanistan visiting the troops Thanksgiving [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=167.72s)]
*  of 2019, this was a commander-in-chief who was loved and respected by the troops. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=172.88s)]
*  And he was feared by our enemies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=179.48s)]
*  And you get Joe Biden, he's a pushover. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=181.52s)]
*  They understand that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=183.6s)]
*  So the Democrats, they wanted to impeach him day one when he became president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=184.88s)]
*  They've never gotten over the fact that he defeated Hillary Clinton. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=189.84s)]
*  And he had me as the chair of his platform committee at the convention. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=194.06s)]
*  The New York Times called it the most conservative Republican platform in 100 years, and I don't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=197.84s)]
*  think they meant it as a compliment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=203.44s)]
*  The policies worked for Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=205.16s)]
*  They were afraid of him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=207.72s)]
*  He needs to be back in the White House, and that's why I'm endorsing him tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=209.08s)]
*  And I will tell you, Joe Biden as president actually scares me now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  I really—you can see how compromised he is cognitively. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=216.0s)]
*  And you know, you ask the question, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  I—intellectually, honestly, I can't think of a single policy that he is—he has been [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=225.0s)]
*  supporting that's working. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=231.16s)]
*  Senator, great to see you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=232.84s)]
*  We do love the people of Wyoming. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=234.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkQDVGFb50Y&t=235.72s)]
