# Tom Homan: Trump is committed to seeking the national security threats
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48)
*  All right, the Trump administration is now shattering records when it comes to illegal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=5.04s)]
*  In his first 50 days in office, President Trump doubled the rate of ICE arrests. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=6.04s)]
*  In fact, according to our very own Bill Mollusian, senior ICE and DHS officials are reporting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=10.08s)]
*  that interior ICE arrests under President Trump have already surpassed Biden's 2024 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=17.0s)]
*  fiscal year total. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  ICE now has made so many arrests that one official says immigration detention is now [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=26.4s)]
*  maxed out, with nearly 50,000 detainees. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=30.4s)]
*  President Trump has made our border so secure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=33.4s)]
*  According to Reuters, there is now a surge of illegals in Mexico seeking help to return [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=36.4s)]
*  home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=42.4s)]
*  Self-deporting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=43.4s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=44.4s)]
*  As the president has already now surpassed Biden's total from 2024, ICE officials are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=45.4s)]
*  now accusing the Biden administration of, quote, cooking the books when it came to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=51.4s)]
*  the number of ICE arrests. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=55.4s)]
*  And now, amid the Trump administration and their crackdown on illegal immigration, border [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=57.4s)]
*  czar Tom Homan appeared at the New York state Capitol today, where he was greeted by radical [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=61.4s)]
*  far-left protesters who shouted at him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=67.4s)]
*  He walked by, couldn't care less, eating his apple. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=71.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=74.4s)]
*  No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=81.4s)]
*  No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=84.4s)]
*  He looked very disturbed, didn't he? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=88.4s)]
*  Now, during his visit, he also issued a very stern warning to New York state's Governor [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=91.4s)]
*  Kathy Hochul about the state's sanctuary status. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=96.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=98.4s)]
*  You're not going to stop us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=99.4s)]
*  New York state, you've got to change the sanctuary status. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=101.4s)]
*  If you don't, get out of the way, because we're going to do our job. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=104.4s)]
*  We'll double the man force here if we have to. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=108.4s)]
*  Because rather than one officer arresting a bad guy in the jail, one officer arresting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=111.4s)]
*  one bad guy, now I've got to send the whole team, because of officer safety concerns, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=114.4s)]
*  community safety concerns, to go look for this guy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=118.4s)]
*  Very inefficient, especially looking for people that want to be found. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=120.4s)]
*  Which means what? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=123.4s)]
*  Means we send more officers to New York to get the job done. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=124.4s)]
*  All right, the Trump administration border czar Tom Homan is with us now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=126.4s)]
*  You look really nervous and very upset as you were eating your apple walking down the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=130.4s)]
*  hall as they were chanting at you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=134.4s)]
*  Not a surprise. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=136.4s)]
*  Let's talk about why you were there and the message you were sending the state of New [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=137.4s)]
*  York. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=142.4s)]
*  Well, it was a meeting with the Republican legislation there in New York, because the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=143.4s)]
*  New York sanctuary status laws. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=149.4s)]
*  You know, you've got Governor Hochul, who stood on national TV after NYPD officers were [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=152.4s)]
*  assaulted, saying she thinks a criminal handling should be deported. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=156.4s)]
*  She said the same thing after a young woman was burned alive on a subway by an illegal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=160.4s)]
*  handling. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=164.4s)]
*  So she says, yeah, criminal handling should be deported. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=165.4s)]
*  However, when Mayor Adams meets with me and wants to help us arrest criminal handling, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=167.4s)]
*  get us back on Rikers Island, she goes down there and tries to fire them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=172.4s)]
*  She's got the green light law where ICE officers and CBP officers can't get DMV data. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=176.4s)]
*  When they pull a car over here, they don't even know who the attacker is, because they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=181.4s)]
*  can't get data from DMV because she locked them out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=185.4s)]
*  And if she says they need a warrant to get that data, and if they get the warrant to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=187.4s)]
*  get that data, what's New York do? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=190.4s)]
*  They notify the bad guy that we're investigating him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=192.4s)]
*  So I'm up here calling her out for sanctuary policies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=194.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, tell me how that's not aiding and abetting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=197.4s)]
*  And tell me about the Supremacy Clause. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=200.4s)]
*  Is this not under the jurisdiction of the federal government? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=202.4s)]
*  It absolutely is, and that's why Pam Bondi is suing the state of New York. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=207.4s)]
*  We got Pam Bondi as the AG now, so New York's going to have some issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=211.4s)]
*  But the men and women, you just saw the great numbers that came out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=215.4s)]
*  God bless the men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=219.4s)]
*  They put their lives on the line for this country every day. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=221.4s)]
*  President Trump is committed to seeking the worst of the worst, the significant public [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=223.4s)]
*  safety threats and national security threats. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=228.4s)]
*  And you've got a governor that doesn't share DMV data with us, which helps us target these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=230.4s)]
*  people, and she's going to notify them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=235.4s)]
*  We're doing operations against them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=237.4s)]
*  I mean, the job's already dangerous enough, and her actions make it more dangerous. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=239.4s)]
*  Again, Mayor Adams coming to the table, and she wants to fire him because he wants to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=243.4s)]
*  make New York City safer against illegal alien crime. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=248.4s)]
*  American people have demanded we take action. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=251.4s)]
*  They gave President Trump a mandate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=254.4s)]
*  President Trump's going to keep his promise to the American people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=255.4s)]
*  Didn't the idea of legal drivers' licenses for illegals in New York take place under Cuomo, though? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=258.4s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=267.4s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=268.4s)]
*  She hasn't done anything about it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=269.4s)]
*  Look, I'll say it again. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=270.4s)]
*  You just read the numbers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=272.4s)]
*  ISIS arresting public safety threats every day, the worst of which is child molesters, rapists, robbers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=273.4s)]
*  I mean, these people are serious—GDA members, MS-13 members, gang members. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=280.4s)]
*  And for any elected official, a governor, a mayor, or a city councilwoman that's going [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=285.4s)]
*  to push back on us for taking public safety threats out of their communities, they don't [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=289.4s)]
*  earn the position they're sitting in. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=294.4s)]
*  Okay, so U.S. immigration detention, are you really maxed out? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=296.4s)]
*  And how do you handle that? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=301.4s)]
*  Because I don't think you're going to stop arresting people, so where do you go put them? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=303.4s)]
*  Look, I'm working with Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=308.4s)]
*  She's knocking it out of the park, and she's doing a great job, President Trump and the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=312.4s)]
*  whole team. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=316.4s)]
*  We got beds being built in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=317.4s)]
*  We're up to 30,000 beds in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=319.4s)]
*  I've got hundreds of sheriffs coming to me wanting us to buy their beds in their jails. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=322.4s)]
*  So the sheriffs are stepping up. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=327.4s)]
*  We got more 287 G-agreements now, Sean, than we've ever had in history in this nation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=329.4s)]
*  So it won't keep moving. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=333.4s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=334.4s)]
*  Congress needs to fund this effort. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=335.4s)]
*  We need to buy more beds. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=337.4s)]
*  We need more airplanes to fly these people out of the country at record numbers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=339.4s)]
*  So we need Congress to fund what the American people voted for, secure the border, which [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=342.4s)]
*  you've done at record pace. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=347.4s)]
*  President Trump did in three weeks, what Joe Biden couldn't do in four years, but we need [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=348.4s)]
*  money to run the deportation operation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=352.4s)]
*  And most importantly, we need money to find 300,000 missing children, many in forced labor, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=355.4s)]
*  many in forced sex trafficking. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=361.4s)]
*  We need money to get this done. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=363.4s)]
*  Tell us about the effort to get people to self-report and register if they're in the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=365.4s)]
*  country illegally. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=371.4s)]
*  And have you made progress with the people that are tipping off illegal immigrants about [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=372.4s)]
*  pending raids, putting the lives of ICE agents at risk? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=378.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, Secretary Noem did some public messaging. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=382.4s)]
*  It's all over the airwaves and it's had a tremendous effect. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=387.4s)]
*  People are self-deporting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=389.4s)]
*  As you reported earlier, the intelligence port state caravans are heading south. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=390.4s)]
*  The Panama Canal, the Daring Gap is busy again. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=395.4s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=398.4s)]
*  It's busy moving south. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=399.4s)]
*  And as far as the whistleblowers, Secretary Noem has already located a couple of them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=400.4s)]
*  She's referred to the DOJ for prosecution, if that's my understanding. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=405.4s)]
*  And if there's any more leakers, we're looking for them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8J_TPL1H48&t=407.4s)]
