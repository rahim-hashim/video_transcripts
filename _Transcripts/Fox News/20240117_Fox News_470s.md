# Jim Jordan: The evidence we have is ‘pretty darn compelling’
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng)
*  All right, turning now to a very disturbing report from Jim Jordan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, get this. Apparently, federal investigators were asking banks to search the personal transactions [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=3.44s)]
*  of individual Americans for terms like Trump and MAGA. Banks were also asking to use merchant [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=10.32s)]
*  category codes to identify potentially suspicious transactions. And what transactions did Treasury [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=19.36s)]
*  think were so suspicious? Small arms, sporting, recreational goods. In other words, if you go to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=27.68s)]
*  stores like Dick's Sporting Goods and Bass Pro Shops—by the way, I got my boots for Iowa at [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=34.32s)]
*  Dick's Sporting Goods. Thank God for Instacart. If you're a law-abiding American who legally [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=40.4s)]
*  purchased a gun after 2021, your government thought you needed to be monitored. Now sources [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=46.16s)]
*  are telling Fox News Digital tonight that the impetus for this very serious invasion of privacy [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=52.4s)]
*  was, of course, none other than January 6. Now, these revelations should scare every single American. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  You want to talk about privacy, constitutional rights? Or do you want to live in an Orwellian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=65.36s)]
*  nightmare with Big Brother? And by the way, so should Biden's wide-open borders, which, by the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=70.08s)]
*  way, continues to have real consequences. Americans, they're fighting back. The family of a 20-year-old [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=77.28s)]
*  woman who was strangled to death by an illegal immigrant who turned out to be an MS-13 gang [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=82.8s)]
*  member is now suing the Biden administration, saying that she would be alive today if Joe Biden [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=89.6s)]
*  enforced our nation's border laws. Here with the latest on all of this, House Judiciary Committee [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=95.92s)]
*  Chairman Jim Jordan. You know, it just so happens I went to Dick's Sporting Goods, ordered from them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=102.0s)]
*  boots when I was headed to Iowa where I saw you and the windchill was 20 below zero. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=108.88s)]
*  And I'm glad that they had great boots, great traction. I'm happy I went there. I want to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=115.92s)]
*  understand this. Tell me what they did here, because do we not have privacy anymore in America? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=121.76s)]
*  Is this not a constitutional violation, unreasonable search and seizure? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=129.12s)]
*  Yeah, now in the last year, Sean, we've exposed the censorship where you had big government, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=134.56s)]
*  big tech, big media, big academia working to censor Americans. Now we have financial [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  surveillance where it's big government working with big banks, big corporations to surveil, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=143.28s)]
*  to spy on Americans. And so it was big banks looking and searching private transactions [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=148.56s)]
*  using key terms at the suggestion of the federal government to find out what you're buying, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=154.16s)]
*  what you're spending your money on. Scary stuff. All it looks like without any warrant, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=160.48s)]
*  without any legal process, they undertook this as a way to identify domestic violent extremism. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  And here's what it sounds a lot like. Remember that memorandum in Richmond about pro-life? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=171.68s)]
*  Catholics are extremists because they go to church and they're pro-life and they talk about, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=178.4s)]
*  protecting human lives. That's exactly what these documents sound like. We're right on the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  on the front edge of this. We'll see how it all progresses. But it's scary stuff. It's financial [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  surveillance of the American people. All right, let's talk about, so your committee and the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  Oversight Committee went forward with a contempt violation against Hunter Biden. Hunter's attorney, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=199.2s)]
*  Abbie Lowell, was seeking a new subpoena. You argued, I think rightly so, that you, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=206.96s)]
*  we already gave you a subpoena. You can comply with that one. However, it seems that negotiations [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=212.88s)]
*  are ongoing. Initially, both you and James Comer said, no, we're not going to give you a special [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=218.72s)]
*  accommodation. It seems now that you're open to one. Why do I suspect? I know Kevin Morris [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  is going in tomorrow, the $6 billion million dollar sugar brother. Do you have any assurance [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=230.72s)]
*  from Abbie Lowell that Hunter Biden won't be pleading the fifth the whole time if you, in fact, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=238.32s)]
*  give that special concession? Well, we've had good conversations. Our chief counsel in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=243.6s)]
*  committee has had good conversations with Mr. Lowell, the counsel for Hunter Biden. We do believe [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=248.96s)]
*  Hunter Biden is going to come in. That's what we want. We want his testimony. Whether he exercises [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=252.56s)]
*  one of his privileges under our constitution is up to him and his counsel and what he decides to do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=256.72s)]
*  But we do expect him to come in. We're pinning down a date for that. But we've also got Kevin [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=261.44000000000005s)]
*  Morris tomorrow. We got Eric Schwerin, Rob Walker, Mervyn Yan. We got all these people coming in in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=265.92s)]
*  the next two weeks. And then we want to talk to Jim Biden. And then we want to also talk to Hunter [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=270.72s)]
*  Biden. We just got to get that date down. But we do, we do believe he is coming. And that's what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=274.72s)]
*  we said in committee last week when we marked up the contempt resolution. We said, we're going to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  pass it out to committee. If Hunter Biden wants to cure this and he wants to come in and we can [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=283.36s)]
*  get the testimony from him, all the better. And that's the negotiations we're in now. We think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=287.36s)]
*  he's coming, which I think is good for our investigation, our impeachment inquiry as we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  move forward. You know, Joe Biden seems to lie a lot. We know he lied when he said, not once [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=295.76s)]
*  did I ever speak to Hunter, my brother, or anybody for that matter about their foreign business deals. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  Then he lied to the American people for years saying the border is closed and the border is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=306.24s)]
*  secure. Everybody around him lied about that. Now we know that he also lied. We were told that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=310.72s)]
*  there was in fact an ethics agreement where they would never know who the people were that were [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  purchasing Hunter Biden's art. Now the art dealer gave a deposition and in that deposition, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  James Comer confirmed this. We now learned that in fact he said no, Hunter demanded to know [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=333.36s)]
*  who the buyers were. And in fact, Joe Biden got involved and he also was talking to the art dealer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=339.92s)]
*  I'm like, wow, is the arrogance that high that they're getting money from all these countries, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=347.6s)]
*  no experience? And Joe taking official actions as vice president that helps his son get paid for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=353.36s)]
*  no experience? Yeah, and the gallerist told us, George Burgess, the gallerist told us that that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=359.44s)]
*  was the only contract he had with any artist he did business with. The only contract he had which [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=364.16s)]
*  had that provision where Hunter Biden can know. And we know that 70% of the art purchased in the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=368.88s)]
*  last two and a half years, totally $1.5 million. We know 70% of that came from a couple of purchasers [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=372.8s)]
*  who happened to be Biden donors, donors to the president's campaign. So tomorrow we're talking [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=378.8s)]
*  with Kevin Morris who bought $875,000 worth of art from Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden obviously knew [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=384.0s)]
*  who that guy was. He was with him last week when he came into the Oversight Committee. So we're [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=390.24s)]
*  talking to him tomorrow. We expect to get some important information that will help us answer [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  the questions we have as we move forward in our impeachment inquiry. Well, apparently he was one [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=398.0s)]
*  of the big purchasers of Hunter's art on the top of the $5 million that had been previously reported. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=402.64s)]
*  Will Joe Biden be called in? Do you believe that your committees will subpoena Joe Biden at the end [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=410.88s)]
*  of this? We're going to move through the key players that we think we need to get to in this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=416.4s)]
*  impeachment inquiry. As we said, Kevin Morris tomorrow, next week, Eric Sheeran, Rob Walker, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=420.48s)]
*  we will talk to them. Then we want to talk to Jim Biden and then Hunter Biden. We think all that's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=424.96s)]
*  going to happen. And then I think we make a decision. Do we move forward with actual [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  articles of impeachment? As I've said many times, Sean, and you know, the evidence I think we have [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  thus far is already pretty darn compelling, but it's important we do this the right way, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=436.88s)]
*  do it with the facts, get the evidence, talk to the key people. That's what we're doing on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  the Judiciary Committee. That's what Mr. Comer is doing on oversight. And of course we had the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=445.28s)]
*  whistleblowers come through the Ways and Means Committee. All right. Congressman Jim Jordan, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=449.76s)]
*  House Judiciary Committee Chairman, thank you sir. We appreciate your time as always. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sUD1w2Dng&t=454.08s)]
