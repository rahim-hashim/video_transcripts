# Gabbard: Kamala Harris doing everything she can to hide the truth
**Fox News:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w)
*  Now to a disturbing report, according to President Trump's campaign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=0.0s)]
*  The 45th president was given a security briefing from the Office of Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  The briefing, Iran is trying to assassinate him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=9.72s)]
*  The campaign says there are, quote, real and very specific threats that are now ongoing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=13.02s)]
*  including a heightened risk of coordinated attacks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=18.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, unfazed, vowing to fight for the American people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=21.52s)]
*  And he's also headed back to Butler, PA. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=25.44s)]
*  And breaking tonight would be assassin Ryan Routh is now officially charged with attempting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=28.3s)]
*  to assassinate Donald Trump in Florida. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=32.9s)]
*  Here with more, co-chair of Trump's transition team, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=35.42s)]
*  You know, knowing that they've known about this Iranian assassination attempt, the idea [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=39.86s)]
*  that they had this vulnerable area, Trump International, in West Palm Beach, Florida, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=47.34s)]
*  in my home state, where they knew where paparazzi would hang out in the bushes around these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  holes and after Butler, and the agents on the ground with the president were great. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=57.94s)]
*  But the fact that they didn't sweep that area and have eyes on that area to make sure [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=63.46s)]
*  that nobody was there, to me, it's unfathomable to me, especially in light of Iranian threats. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=68.34s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, it is unfathomable, except this is the reality of the Joe Biden, Kamala Harris [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=77.62s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=83.7s)]
*  This should be the fundamental core question is, why did they deny President Trump and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=85.42s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, for that matter, who also has had threats on his life, why did they deny [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=91.18s)]
*  them the security that they needed? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=95.98s)]
*  President Trump's campaign had asked for additional security over and over again, and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  it was President Biden who denied that security. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=102.66s)]
*  So yes, it is deeply disturbing to see that, you know, Iran is supporting these assassination [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  attempts, but they're not the only ones. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=111.62s)]
*  We know that the drug cartels, that any of these entities that President Trump is a threat [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=113.26s)]
*  to their existence, they are trying to take him out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=118.34s)]
*  And President Biden's unwillingness to ensure his security from the get go is absolutely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=122.94s)]
*  unconscionable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=128.42s)]
*  The other thing that is also of great concern is a recent Rasmussen poll, Sean, real quick, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=129.62s)]
*  that showed almost 30% of Democrats are quietly hoping that Donald Trump is assassinated. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  And this is a direct consequence of the years long effort to dehumanize President Trump [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  so that people don't feel so bad about doing these kinds of incredulous actions and attempts [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=148.54s)]
*  on his life. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=155.5s)]
*  And the president and his team have asked repeatedly and have been denied repeatedly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=156.5s)]
*  more security, just for the record. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=162.06s)]
*  You talk about Kamala Harris and President Trump's campaign, their challenges and their [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  opportunities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=169.06s)]
*  What are they? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=170.1s)]
*  Well, you know, President Trump has the opportunity here in these final five and a half weeks [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=173.1s)]
*  before Election Day to really do what he's been doing, continuing to speak the truth [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=177.94s)]
*  about Kamala Harris's disastrous record, the harm and hardship she has caused for the American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=183.14s)]
*  people, everything from the increased cost of living that's created such hardship for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  people who have to make difficult choices about basic necessities that they can afford, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=193.7s)]
*  to the wide open borders that have caused tens of millions of illegal immigrants to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=198.42s)]
*  cross our borders. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=201.9s)]
*  You talked about the heart wrenching consequences of the American people and young women and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=202.9s)]
*  girls who've been raped and murdered by some of these Venezuelan gang members and others. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=207.94s)]
*  And then we look at our foreign policy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=213.18s)]
*  We look at the fact that under Harris and Biden, we are now embroiled in multiple wars [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=214.66s)]
*  around the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=218.58s)]
*  We are closer to the brink of World War III and nuclear war than we have been before. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  The truth is what the American people deserve. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=226.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris is doing everything she possibly can to hide the truth from the American people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=228.54s)]
*  and has created this lie and a narrative that her pollsters have sold as what needs to happen [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=233.82s)]
*  in order for her to win. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=240.78s)]
*  All right, Tulsi Gavrid, appreciate it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=241.78s)]
*  It's an interesting time in the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=245.45999999999998s)]

*  We'll get reaction. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjt9D2FZ9w&t=269.98s)]
