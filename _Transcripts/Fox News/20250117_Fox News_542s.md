# Sean Hannity: This can be the most transformational presidency
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight in less than three days, Donald Trump will be sworn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=0.0s)]
*  into office as the 47th president of our country. On Sunday, we will be at our nation's capital [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=6.24s)]
*  with a live show. We're going to kick off what will be a very busy historic week on [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=12.96s)]
*  Monday because of dangerously cold temperatures. I mean, with the wind chill below zero, it's, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=17.92s)]
*  it's going to be really cold. Well, Donald Trump's inauguration will take place inside, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=24.88s)]
*  making him the first president since Ronald Reagan to be sworn in at the Capitol Rotunda. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=29.84s)]
*  I think a good call. Reagan's 1985 inauguration was also held inside because of extremely [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=34.8s)]
*  cold weather. Now, Donald Trump is expected to hit the ground running with a flurry of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=41.88s)]
*  executive orders, other critical measures, but not before a little celebration. There [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=47.1s)]
*  will be musical performances. Carrie Underwood, America the Beautiful, Rascal Flats, Jason [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=53.2s)]
*  Aldean, Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, the village people, Lee Greenwood. They're all going [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=59.12s)]
*  to be there. And speaking of Billy Ray, he will also be performing at the Make America [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=65.64s)]
*  Great Again rally. That's on Sunday night. He will be with us in just a few minutes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=70.28s)]
*  We'll get a preview of that and why he felt so strongly about going to Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=74.6s)]
*  after the assassination attempt. Now, there will also be dozens of business leaders in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=80.17999999999999s)]
*  town. Well, Elon Musk will be there. Bezos will be there. Mark Zuckerberg will be there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=85.24s)]
*  Apple CEO Tim Cook will be there. Even Bill Gates seems excited about Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  He was, quote, impressed and intrigued after a recent dinner with the president-elect. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=102.96s)]
*  Have you met with Donald Trump since the election? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=104.56s)]
*  Yeah, I had a chance to go have a long and actually quite intriguing dinner with him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=106.52s)]
*  What did you discuss? What was intriguing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=112.8s)]
*  Well, we touched on a lot of things. It was over three hours, to my surprise. It was just [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=114.96s)]
*  he and I, his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and the person who helps manage things for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=120.52s)]
*  me, Larry Cohen. So the four of us sat there and it was quite wide ranging. I felt like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  he was energized and looking forward to helping to drive innovation. I was frankly impressed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=132.2s)]
*  with how well he showed a lot of interest in the issues I brought up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  He's describing the guy that I've known for 30 years. Now, Donald Trump isn't just bringing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=148.8s)]
*  together business leaders. For the first time, the prime minister of Italy, the president [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=153.68s)]
*  of Argentina, they will be attending the inauguration. China, meanwhile, they're sending their vice [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=158.28s)]
*  president after a recent phone call between Donald Trump and President Xi. And last but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  certainly not least, all of this was made possible by all of you, each and every one [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=169.12s)]
*  of you. And again, I can't thank each and every one of you enough. This can be the most [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=176.12s)]
*  transformational presidency in a hundred years. There will be thousands upon thousands of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=181.84s)]
*  loyal Donald Trump supporters like you in DC celebrating what is a new day in America [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  that would have been, you know, would not have been possible without all of your hard [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=193.24s)]
*  work, your effort, your perseverance. And many of you watching tonight, you have stuck [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=198.04s)]
*  with Donald Trump through thick and thin, through trials, through witch hunts, through [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=204.04s)]
*  early morning raids, dishonest smear campaigns, to assassination attempts. Many of you were [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=208.84s)]
*  shunned, you were censored, you were harassed simply because of your deeply held political [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=214.52s)]
*  beliefs. But you hung in there, you did the right thing, you fought hard for what you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=219.68s)]
*  believed in. And because of all of you, Donald Trump now has a mandate to return America [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=224.42s)]
*  to what I'm calling constitutional order. Imagine cutting $2 trillion in spending, and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=231.06s)]
*  that would limit the size, the scope, the influence of government. That would be less [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=237.06s)]
*  bureaucracy. That would be greater freedom. What a concept, limited government. And for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=241.7s)]
*  the first time a majority of the American people, they are rooting for Donald Trump [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=246.98s)]
*  to succeed. Nearly six out of 10 Americans believe that he will do a good job as president. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=250.74s)]
*  And meanwhile, the left is now more unpopular around the world than at any point since the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=256.74s)]
*  fall of the Soviet Union. Freedom, meritocracy, individualism, logic, common sense, they are [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=262.58s)]
*  on the rise. Statism, redistribution, socialism, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, it is dying [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=270.58s)]
*  needed death. And here at home, the Democratic Party is in complete shambles. A source close [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=278.58s)]
*  to President Biden telling NBC News that Biden feels quote, totally dejected and the people [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  around him as well. And insiders are saying that the Biden White House feels like a morgue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  We have kind of been saying that in our own way for the past four years. A majority of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=298.74s)]
*  the American people say that Biden, he's made the economy worse. They are right. He has. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  He's leaving office with a record low approval rating. Last night on MSDNC, Joe Biden does [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=308.26s)]
*  what he always does, takes responsibility for nothing, lashes out against red states, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=314.98s)]
*  blaming conservatives for his poor job performance. Take a look. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  I got a lot of criticism, understandably. We've invested more in red states than blue states. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=326.7s)]
*  That's in this book. That's in this report. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=334.86s)]
*  For two reasons. One, red states really screwed up in terms of the way they handle their economy [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=337.0s)]
*  and the way they handle manufacturing, the way they handle access to supply chains. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=343.16s)]
*  All right. That makes no sense at all whatsoever. But that's what we have come to expect from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=348.68s)]
*  the leader of the Democratic Party. In fact, you probably won't see many highlights from [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=355.6s)]
*  Biden's final sit down interview on any other network because as per usual, it was nothing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=359.76s)]
*  but a dumpster fire. You decide. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=366.2s)]
*  You've heard Barack get mad at me as a kid all the time. He said, I know, I know, all [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  politics is personal. Yeah. Well, it's about understanding what motivates the other guy, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  other woman and what their interests are. That's different than me writing a check and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=383.4s)]
*  me signing a check and saying I did it. I'm not a very good huckster. And I didn't think [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=389.48s)]
*  it, by the way. I think it was I've got to go to Ukraine, but I think it was important. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=395.44s)]
*  It's clear. It's obvious. Americans on both sides of the aisle. Joe Biden is not fit to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=403.8s)]
*  serve. He's not been fit for four years to serve. We told all of you this before the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=408.88s)]
*  2020 election. At the time, we were kind of excoriated to tell him the truth. Over time, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=414.68s)]
*  it became apparent to everybody, according to the New York Times, multiple Democratic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=420.56s)]
*  senators were begging Joe not to run for a second term. That would include Chuck Schumer. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=424.92s)]
*  All the while Obama behind the scenes pulling the strings along with Nancy Pelosi. And after [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=430.6s)]
*  all the election, all the big players in the Democratic Party, right now, they're kind [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=437.2s)]
*  of all hating on each other. And historic loser Kamala Harris, apparently also not in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=442.24s)]
*  good spirits, according to insiders. She is deeply sad. She feels betrayed by Joe Biden. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=448.14s)]
*  I think she's the one involved in betraying him and is also at war with almost every, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=455.06s)]
*  everyone in her own party. Ultimately, after years of hysteria, dishonesty, woke politics, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=460.58s)]
*  eco-socialism, failure, the weaponization of government, this is what the Democrats, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=466.5s)]
*  frankly, have earned and this is what they deserve. I hope they can use this moment to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=472.14s)]
*  fix what's broken in their own party. It would be nice to have a two-party system, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  but not a radical leftist system. You know, one that would create a cradle to grave, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=481.3s)]
*  womb to the tomb, new Green Deal society with wide open borders without any vetting that offers [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=486.98s)]
*  free taxpayer funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants and convicts and also [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=493.62s)]
*  gender affirming care for children without parental consent. That is not in touch with [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=501.34s)]
*  Americans' values. The only Democrat at this point that seems somewhat reasonable today is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=506.26s)]
*  Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. It's going to be very interesting to watch him as [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=512.38s)]
*  the party moves forward. But again, really it's a time of reflection, introspection and a time on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=517.78s)]
*  this show to say thanks to all of you because in less than three days, because of your hard work, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=525.3s)]
*  your dedication, you filtering out the lives of the legacy media, Donald Trump will be back in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=531.26s)]
*  office and America now has a golden opportunity to get back on track. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmoKfc_BcI&t=537.78s)]
