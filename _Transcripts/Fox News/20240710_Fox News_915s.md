# Hannity: This is a ploy to keep 'control of the White House'
**Fox News:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, the Democrats' worst nightmare is now unfolding in slow motion for all to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=2.4s)]
*  see. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=8.2s)]
*  The current president of the United States is now running for reelection. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  He's not fit to serve. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=12.6s)]
*  Everyone on Earth knows this and has known for years that Joe Biden is mentally inept, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=14.56s)]
*  with the exception maybe of Joe Biden himself, who refuses to step aside. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=20.72s)]
*  Now, after years of covering up all of this, the flat-out lying to the American people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=25.36s)]
*  and maybe to themselves, top Democrats, celebrities in Hollywood, all the elites, prominent left-wing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  pundits are coming out of the woodwork to beg their clueless president to drop out of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  the race just weeks before the Democratic National Convention. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=43.8s)]
*  Even Georgie Stephanopoulos, David Axelrod, Michael Moore, the editorial board at the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=48.04s)]
*  New York Times, the numerous Democratic lawmakers—there's actually eight of them—have openly doubted [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=53.32s)]
*  Joe's ability to beat Trump or even fulfill the basic duties of his job. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Chuck Todd now admitting the White House insiders were telling him about Biden's struggles [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=64.6s)]
*  two years ago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=69.76s)]
*  Chuck, you never thought you should report that, which is why he's part of the cognitive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  cover-up and lie cabal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile today, Biden's close ally, Nancy Pelosi, she flat-out refused to throw her [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=80.16s)]
*  support fully behind Biden, instead ominously urging the president to think about his options [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  this week because time is running short. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  She already—he already thought about it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  He said he's staying in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, according to Axios, even Chuck Schumer is reportedly open to dumping Biden in 2024, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  and now liberal Hollywood elitist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=102.52s)]
*  And frankly, I refer to him as an ignorant jackass. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=104.52s)]
*  George Clooney is calling on Joe to withdraw from the race with a dramatic op-ed in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=107.6s)]
*  New York Times. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  He says he knew all of this at that big fundraiser weeks ago, but of course refused to tell you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  and the American people the truth, another liar that's part of the cover-up. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, George Clooney isn't just any far-left actor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  He's one of Obama's dear and good friends. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=130.4s)]
*  This op-ed doesn't happen without Obama's approval. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=133.76s)]
*  And still, it's important to note that George Clooney and Chuck Todd and Barack Obama, they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=137.44s)]
*  don't get to just override the will of the people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=142.48s)]
*  Democracy is on the ballot this year, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=146.68s)]
*  Democracy matters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=150.48s)]
*  Every vote counts, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=151.48s)]
*  That's what we're told, according to liberals. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=152.48s)]
*  The very fate of democracy is at stake this election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=155.42s)]
*  That's why they tell us, you know, this over and over and over again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=158.64s)]
*  And yet, the Democratic establishment—think about this—they're now trying to disenfranchise [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=163.32s)]
*  the millions and millions of Democrats that actually went to the ballot box, or mailed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=169.0s)]
*  it in, and voted for Joe Biden in their primaries. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=174.68s)]
*  They are threatening to cut off big money, pressure Joe to step down, all while openly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=178.72s)]
*  plotting to scheme to replace Biden with someone else at the convention. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=183.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=188.56s)]
*  Looks like a coup d'état to me by a bunch of Washington bosses, Hollywood liberal elites, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=189.56s)]
*  big money elites, to keep control of the White House one way or the other. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  They all knew that Biden was a mess for years. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=199.56s)]
*  Don't kid yourself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, they just don't like that they're going to lose. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what it comes down to, and they hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  All of this is the biggest threat to democracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=210.36s)]
*  What they're doing is the threat to democracy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is not the threat to democracy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  If Democrats truly cared about democracy, they would actually speak out against this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  mutiny. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Despite all of his mental struggles that have gone on for years, Joe Biden was chosen by [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  the people in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=230.0s)]
*  He's the presumptive nominee, nominated by Democratic voters across the country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=231.6s)]
*  And as of now, he's not stepping down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=236.0s)]
*  Instead, Joe Biden keeps shuffling out on the campaign trail, giving it his good old [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=238.68s)]
*  best every day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=246.76s)]
*  We're going to have a conversation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  And the most diverse cabinet in history. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=257.64s)]
*  I think that goes sometimes unnoticed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=260.28s)]
*  I promised I was going to have a cabinet that looked like America. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=263.28s)]
*  And it does. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=268.28s)]
*  More minorities, more women, more labor. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=269.28s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=272.96s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=273.96s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=274.96s)]
*  That's why we're strong. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  We're diverse. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  We're strong. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  We've got to stop looking at it like it's no problem. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  It's an asset. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  It's an asset. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Cut off that feed immediately. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  He's not making sense again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=290.12s)]
*  Now, despite all the turmoil, humiliation and hypocrisy surrounding the president, well, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  tonight's monologue really isn't about Joe Biden. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  As it stands now, frankly, he's an insignificant figure with failed policies dictated by a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=299.12s)]
*  radical Marxist, New Green Deal extremist party. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=305.04s)]
*  He's not calling the shots. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=309.04s)]
*  He's not directing policy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=310.36s)]
*  He's not even awake most of the time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=312.2s)]
*  If Joe Biden makes the past the looming coup d'etat at the DNC, he'll be the candidate [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=314.36s)]
*  in name only anyway, just as he's been president in name only for the last four years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=320.76s)]
*  As CNN's Van Jones is pointing out, quote, Democrats, they are running Kamala Harris [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  for president one way or another. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  Either Biden is kicked to the curb or she becomes the nominee or Joe stays in the race [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=333.0s)]
*  and Kamala takes over when Biden is no longer functional. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=337.68s)]
*  Now, unfortunately for Democrats, this is where the nightmare really begins to ramp [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=340.96s)]
*  up. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=346.12s)]
*  You see, Vice President Harris, well, she's not really been vetted. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=347.12s)]
*  We've vetted her. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=351.24s)]
*  I have piles this big. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=352.24s)]
*  I have a lot to share with you in the next couple of weeks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=354.28s)]
*  Vice President Harris is toxic, radical, extreme in every way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=357.04s)]
*  Even Joe Biden, at his very worst, is now polling better than Kamala Harris, and for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=363.16s)]
*  good reason. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=367.56s)]
*  Don't forget, she ran for president in the last Democratic primary. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=368.56s)]
*  She didn't even make it to Iowa and didn't make it to New Hampshire and Iowa, dropping [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=371.92s)]
*  out in 2019 after polling in the single digits. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=377.48s)]
*  Even now, voters think Vice President Harris is unlikable, and the constant nervous laughter [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=381.76s)]
*  and the giggling vice president is quite off-putting, to say the least. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=387.96s)]
*  And according to reports, Kamala often refuses to prepare for important events, and then, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=393.12s)]
*  when it doesn't go right, she blames her staff. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=398.64s)]
*  Perfect excuse. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=401.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, her public appearances are usually disjointed, confusing, cringe-worthy, a lot [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=402.8s)]
*  of platitudes about the significance of the passage of time, because you see, time is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=408.76000000000005s)]

*  And then the great love of Venn diagrams. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=420.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=422.68s)]
*  The largest investment ever to take on the climate crisis, roughly a trillion dollars [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=423.68s)]
*  with a T. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  I had to. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=437.48s)]
*  One of the things I love are Venn diagrams. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=446.76s)]
*  I love Venn diagrams. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=452.48s)]
*  You need to get to go, and need to be able to get where you need to go to do the work [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=455.32s)]
*  and get home. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  The significance of the passage of time, right, the significance of the passage of time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=466.56s)]
*  More parents are seeing the value of educators when they had to bring their kids and say, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=470.92s)]
*  we're not paying them nearly enough. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=477.92s)]
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=482.56s)]
*  Every day, it is time for us to agree. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=489.56s)]
*  We all believe that when we talk about the children of the community, they are the children [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=493.36s)]
*  of the community. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  So Ukraine is a country in Europe. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=499.64s)]
*  It exists next to another country called Russia. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=504.44s)]
*  Russia is a bigger country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=507.92s)]
*  Russia is a powerful country. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=509.64s)]
*  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=511.24s)]
*  So basically, that's wrong. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=515.16s)]
*  Transportation is about getting to go. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=520.6s)]
*  Where you need to go. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=523.16s)]
*  So you can go there, and you need transportation to go where you need to go. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=524.68s)]
*  In the community where you live, where everybody lives in a community of other people in the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=530.04s)]
*  community. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  When all else fails, the giggling starts, and just know that Kamala is often unburdened [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=538.16s)]
*  by what has been. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been, you know? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been! [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been! [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been! [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=562.06s)]
*  Let us remain focused on what many of you have heard me say all the time. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=567.88s)]
*  Let us remain focused on what can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=572.3s)]
*  Joe has an excuse. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=579.4s)]
*  What's her excuse? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=582.88s)]
*  Now, there's even more—there's more than five minutes of Kamala Harris repeating that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=584.68s)]
*  line over and over again. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=590.6s)]
*  I'm going to play it one night. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=592.68s)]
*  But the vice president isn't just a bad politician. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=594.88s)]
*  She is a radical, far-left, Marxist socialist. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=597.6s)]
*  Her record is horrendous, her track record awful. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=600.6s)]
*  As a senator, she co-sponsored a bill with Bernie Sanders that would force Americans [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  into a socialized, single-payer healthcare system. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=609.0s)]
*  She also sponsored a bill to prohibit drilling for oil in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=612.56s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=618.0s)]
*  Kamala even spearheaded efforts in the Senate to pass AOC's insane Green New Deal in 2020. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=619.0s)]
*  Four days, remember, after that Minneapolis police precinct was burned to the ground by [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=626.32s)]
*  those peaceful protestors that those of us with common sense called violent rioters? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=630.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's when Kamala tweeted out this link, calling on her own following to chip [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=638.2s)]
*  in to post bail for these criminals. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=644.08s)]
*  So Harris was clearly supporting—I think you can call it insurrection. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=647.24s)]
*  Where's Liz Cheney when you need her? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=651.48s)]
*  Three weeks later, then, of course, she issued this thinly-veiled threat, telling Americans, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=653.44s)]
*  take note, the rioters are not going to stop. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=658.36s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=661.12s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=662.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=663.12s)]
*  This is a movement, I'm telling you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=665.04s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=667.12s)]
*  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=669.04s)]
*  It is going to—they're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=671.88s)]
*  not going to stop after Election Day. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=675.04s)]
*  And that should be—everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't—they're [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=677.44s)]
*  not going to let up, and they should not. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=681.88s)]
*  Take note. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=685.32s)]
*  Beware, the rioters aren't going to stop. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=686.32s)]
*  As vice president, she also praised the hateful anti-Semitic, anti-Israel riots on the left, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=688.24s)]
*  as her own administration revealed that Iran is funding these so-called demonstrations. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=693.64s)]
*  Law and order, that means nothing to Kamala Harris. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=699.16s)]
*  So it's no surprise that her role as border czar, that has been an abject failure also. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=702.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=707.64s)]
*  I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=708.64s)]
*  trek to the United States-Mexico border. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=714.76s)]
*  Do not come. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=719.62s)]
*  Do not come. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=722.62s)]
*  Now, outside of that speech, one visit to the southern border, not where it mattered, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=723.62s)]
*  by the way, Kamala Harris hasn't lifted a finger to secure our country. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=729.14s)]
*  Under her watch, a record 10-plus million unvetted illegal immigrants from over 175 [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=733.54s)]
*  countries have poured into our country. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=739.38s)]
*  You're paying for it in many ways. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=741.1s)]
*  This includes a record number of suspected terrorists, gang members, rapists, murderers, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=743.62s)]
*  other criminals, unvetted illegals from countries with terrorist ties and from our top geopolitical [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=750.34s)]
*  foes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  Americans are dying because Kamala was unable and unwilling to take action. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=756.9399999999999s)]
*  Could you imagine what Putin, President Xi, the mullahs of Iran would do if she was president? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=763.34s)]
*  Actually, you don't need to imagine. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=769.06s)]
*  Here's Kamala's pathetic warning to Iran before the mullahs ultimately attacked Israel. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=771.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=776.66s)]
*  And what's the message to Iran? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=778.02s)]
*  Don't. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=779.86s)]
*  As President Biden said, just don't. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=780.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=783.5s)]
*  One word. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=784.5s)]
*  Pretty straightforward. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=785.5s)]
*  Don't? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=786.5s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=787.5s)]
*  No one takes Kamala seriously. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=788.5s)]
*  Our enemies will laugh at her and completely dismiss her. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=792.16s)]
*  And by the way, doesn't she attend weekly one-on-one lunches with Joe Biden? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=795.02s)]
*  Obviously she knew Biden was a cognitive mess, and yet she, like so many others, covered [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=800.1800000000001s)]
*  it up. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=806.02s)]
*  She lied regularly to you, all of you. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=807.02s)]
*  Biden told the world that Joe was as sharp as ever, and just like she lied about the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=809.86s)]
*  border being secure and closed and the economy doing great. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=813.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=817.5400000000001s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=818.5400000000001s)]
*  You're confident this border's secure? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=824.22s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=827.86s)]
*  our administration. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=835.86s)]
*  We came into office during the height of a pandemic. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=836.96s)]
*  Record unemployment. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=840.44s)]
*  And because of our economic policies, we now are reducing inflation. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=843.1600000000001s)]
*  We have created over 14 million new jobs. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  We've created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=851.72s)]
*  Wages are up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=855.5600000000001s)]
*  And so we've seen great progress. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=857.0s)]
*  She needs to be held accountable for her role in this corrupt, dishonest administration [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=860.36s)]
*  and cover up of Joe's cognitive decline. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=865.0s)]
*  So does White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre, Circleback Jen Psaki, everybody [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=867.92s)]
*  else involved. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=873.0s)]
*  They were once again, all of them, caught in a major lie of historic proportions. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=874.0s)]
*  And despite her denials, Joe Biden did in fact see a neurologist at the White House [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=879.36s)]
*  on January 17th. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=883.56s)]
*  Of course, we still don't know exactly why. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=885.4799999999999s)]
*  A Parkinson's specialist has been frequently visiting Joe's White House. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=887.76s)]
*  Still a big secret. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  This administration has rotten to the core. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=893.94s)]
*  Their policies across the board have failed and the American people, all of you, are suffering [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=896.0200000000001s)]
*  the consequences. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4SGn7l0lY&t=901.7800000000001s)]
