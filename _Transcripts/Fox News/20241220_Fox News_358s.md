# Trump’s incoming press secretary laughs off ‘The View’s’ recent theory
**Fox News:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q)
*  I mean, that's just a little weird. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now with more incoming White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=3.14s)]
*  Caroline, I'm so thrilled to have you with me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=6.76s)]
*  And you would think, you know, ABC, having just paid $15 million for a defamation lawsuit, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=10.0s)]
*  would think not to engage in conspiracy theories about assassination attempts, but I guess [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=17.12s)]
*  that's too much to ask from the view. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=21.86s)]
*  I mean, I got to ask you, because they said it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Are you aware of any plots from Elon Musk to push President Trump down the stairs? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=26.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=33.72s)]
*  Let me be unequivocally clear about that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=34.92s)]
*  And watching this clip, I couldn't help but think how ironic that Whoopi Goldberg and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=37.92s)]
*  Joy Behar and the rest of the ladies on The View spend their time calling Republicans [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=42.24s)]
*  the conspiracy theorists. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=46.92s)]
*  But they have been wrong about everything they have said over the last couple of years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=48.94s)]
*  They likened President Trump to Hitler. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=54.0s)]
*  They have mocked him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=56.42s)]
*  They have shamed him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=57.64s)]
*  They have lied about him consistently on their show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=58.64s)]
*  And it was a joy to watch them on November the 6th when they realized that tens of millions [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=62.32s)]
*  of Americans do not listen to the lies that they have spewed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=67.24s)]
*  These women are completely out of touch with reality. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=70.98s)]
*  And you're right, ABC should wake up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  They just paid $15 million to President Trump's future library. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=75.76s)]
*  That's a great thing for the American people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=79.76s)]
*  You know, I wanted to start with that crazy absurdity because during my tenure as White [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=84.84s)]
*  House press secretary, there was a lot of absurdities coming from the press. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=89.68s)]
*  I remember one briefing where Ryan Lizza bizarrely asked me if Trump was happy that the South [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=92.6s)]
*  lost the Civil War, to which, like, you could see me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=98.64s)]
*  I stopped. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  I looked at him and said, that is absurd. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you'll deal with these kind of crazy questions from the White House podium. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=104.88s)]
*  How do you plan to deal with it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I absolutely will. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  I feel prepared to do that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=115.92s)]
*  I've been facing the media now, speaking on behalf of President Trump on the campaign [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=117.4s)]
*  trail for the past couple of years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  And we are expecting the media to be hostile. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=124.28s)]
*  However, Kayleigh, if you do talk to a lot of these reporters off the record, they will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=127.72s)]
*  tell you they look forward to more press transparency and access. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=132.24s)]
*  And while we will expose the fake news when they are fake, we will hold them accountable [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=136.58s)]
*  for their lies and smears of President Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=140.86s)]
*  I can also assure the American people that they are going to be hearing directly from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=143.46s)]
*  the leader of the free world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=147.3s)]
*  And the press likes to hear that, too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=149.06s)]
*  That's something that has not happened over the past four years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=150.58s)]
*  We've had an incompetent, senile president, as proven by that scathing Wall Street Journal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=153.54s)]
*  report that came out today and you discussed on the show earlier. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=158.34s)]
*  You have a press secretary who hardly knows what's going on in the building and never [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=161.9s)]
*  gives honest and truthful answers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=166.06s)]
*  All of that is going to change on January 20th, as evidenced by President Trump's press [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=168.42s)]
*  conference at Mar-a-Lago this week, where he took nearly 90 minutes' worth of questions [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=172.26s)]
*  from the legacy media. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  And so nobody cares about access more than President Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=178.06s)]
*  You knew that as his press secretary. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=182.22s)]
*  That's going to change come January. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=184.54s)]
*  But we will continue to hold the fake news accountable, no doubt about it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  Caroline, you know, I read this report from Media Research Center that there's been 96 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  percent negative coverage from the broadcast networks of Trump's cabinet picks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=197.22s)]
*  And yet polling shows a majority of Americans support them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=202.06s)]
*  And the reason I wanted to bring this up, and I would never ask you to reveal, you know, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=206.1s)]
*  a conversation you had with a reporter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=209.62s)]
*  So I just want to ask for a general characterization. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=211.54s)]
*  You'd think after Trump got more popular raw vote count than any Republican in the history [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=214.62s)]
*  of presidential politics won the popular vote, that there would be some press that's eating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  crow right now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=225.78s)]
*  In any of your conversations, do you get a sense that reporters are stepping back and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=226.78s)]
*  saying, look, he's doing something right and maybe we need to reassess how we look at this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=230.38000000000002s)]
*  presidency? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=234.58s)]
*  I do think a lot of members of the legacy media are realizing that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  I thought that was evident at the press conference at Mar-a-Lago this past week, where the questions [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=241.9s)]
*  truly were focused on the issues of the day. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=247.38000000000002s)]
*  And there are a lot of problems plaguing our country and the American people right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=250.34s)]
*  We are still entangled in a war in Ukraine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=254.8s)]
*  The Middle East is chaotic. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  We have inflation that's still robbing the American people of their hard-earned paychecks. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=259.48s)]
*  We have a border that continues to be a mess. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=263.6s)]
*  We have hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals roaming free in our country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=266.12s)]
*  And so I hope that the media will focus on the issues that matter to the American people, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=271.3s)]
*  the issues that led them to vote in a resounding way for President Trump on November the 5th. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=276.48s)]
*  That's what President Trump is focused on more so than ever. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=283.56s)]
*  We have an array of executive action that will be rolled out on day one to change the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=286.64s)]
*  lives of the American people immediately. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=292.88s)]
*  We have the House. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=295.48s)]
*  We have the Senate. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=296.48s)]
*  President Trump has big plans for Capitol Hill. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=297.48s)]
*  And so I hope the legacy media will take a step back and realize that the American people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=300.52s)]
*  haven't listened to their lies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=304.88s)]
*  Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=307.12s)]
*  And President Trump ran in an untraditional media lane on the campaign trail. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=309.56s)]
*  It's a big part of the reason he won, because he sat down with podcasters and social influencers [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=313.84s)]
*  and new voices that the American people are clearly listening to. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=318.7s)]
*  And as President Trump's press secretary, we're going to find new ways to bring those [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=322.38s)]
*  voices into the briefing room as well, which I think will be a very effective way to continue [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=325.8s)]
*  to get the president's message out to the American people. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=329.74s)]
*  Clearly, he did it on the campaign trail. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=332.68s)]
*  We will continue that in the White House. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=334.64s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, you are always on offense. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=337.72s)]
*  You are incredibly intelligent. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=340.0s)]
*  I am so thrilled. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  You are White House press secretary. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  You are going to do a phenomenal job, and you have a lot of people cheering you on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=344.56s)]
*  They're blessed to have you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIB5xlsX26Q&t=347.92s)]
