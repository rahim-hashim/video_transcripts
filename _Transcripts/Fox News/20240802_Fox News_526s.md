# Mike Pompeo: The Biden admin exchanged innocents for terrorists
**Fox News:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM)
*  All right, as part of this exchange, Vladimir Putin prioritized the release of this guy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=0.0s)]
*  Vadim Krasikov. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=5.36s)]
*  Now, but exactly why remains unclear. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=6.88s)]
*  Now, Krasikov was imprisoned in Germany for the 2019 murder of a Georgian citizen who [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  had fought against Russian troops in Chechnya before claiming asylum in Germany. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=15.84s)]
*  And while the Kremlin has denied any involvement with the murder, the German court determined [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=21.12s)]
*  Krasikov acted on behalf of Russian authorities who gave him the resources to carry out the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=26.52s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=32.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Biden-Harris administration's latest show of weakness, it was announced [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=33.0s)]
*  yesterday that three 9-11 defendants struck a plea deal with the government. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=37.68s)]
*  Now, this is a disgrace, an insult to the victims of 9-11 and their families who have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=43.56s)]
*  been patiently waiting for true justice. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=49.28s)]
*  This deal includes the alleged mastermind of 9-11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=52.6s)]
*  But after facing harsh criticism, well, the White House is now trying to claim they actually [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  played no role at all whatsoever in the plea deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=61.64s)]
*  And the Democrats' presidential candidate has said, we need the courage to stop saying [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=65.38s)]
*  the words radical Islamic terrorism, any illegal alien. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  Is this just another one of their attempts to rewrite history? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction tonight, former secretary of state and Fox News contributor, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=79.0s)]
*  our friend Mike Pompeo is back. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=83.2s)]
*  I'm not going to hide my happiness, Mr. Secretary. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=85.2s)]
*  I'm glad that Evan Gurskiewicz and Paul Whelan are home and these other hostages are home. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  But I also saw Vladimir Putin embrace this convicted murderer when—and greeted them [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=97.0s)]
*  on the tarmac when they arrived in Moscow earlier today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=102.56s)]
*  I'm very happy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  Please don't misunderstand my question. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  What worries me is that if you make a deal to get hostages, you're creating an environment [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  where there's going to be more hostage-taking. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=119.24s)]
*  Am I wrong on that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=121.96s)]
*  Mr. Schoen, you have both parts of that right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=125.56s)]
*  It will be joyous tonight at Joint Base Andrews. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=127.88s)]
*  I remember I'd been the secretary of state for just a couple weeks when we brought three [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=130.68s)]
*  Americans home from North Korea who'd been held in Pyongyang. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=135.34s)]
*  There's no more joyous moment than reuniting those folks with their families, and I am [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  thrilled for those folks who are coming home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=141.78s)]
*  But what you can see now is the Biden administration has done it wrong. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  When we brought those North Koreans home, we didn't pay a penny. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=147.78s)]
*  We used true American power. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=150.3s)]
*  What they've now done is they've exchanged innocence—a Wall Street Journal journalist, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=152.34s)]
*  another innocent businessman in Moscow—and they've traded them for a terrorist who committed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=157.22000000000003s)]
*  murder on German soil. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  That extortion racket will only increase. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  We've now created a market price. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=167.06s)]
*  And, Sean, you don't need to guess whether I'm right about this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=168.58s)]
*  The United States paid $6 billion to get four or five hostages home from Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  Good for getting them home. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=177.82s)]
*  But there are more Americans held today by the Iranians in Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=179.06s)]
*  You just pushed this problem down the road. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=183.82s)]
*  And so while tonight will be wonderful and a blessing to those families, the risk is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=186.38s)]
*  that there will be more families of more innocent Americans who are traveling all over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=191.06s)]
*  the world who one day are held hostage, and they spend years in captivity as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=194.62s)]
*  That's the risk. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=198.82s)]
*  That's the danger. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=199.82s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, let me ask you about the other issue we discussed that the administration [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=200.82s)]
*  claims to have no part of. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=205.32s)]
*  The New York Post headlined today, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=207.32s)]
*  Atrocity of Justice, 9-11 Mastermind, Spared Death Penalty, and Shocking Plea Deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  And it says at the very bottom—I'll hold it up for our audience—he deserves hell, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=215.54s)]
*  which I agree with. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=220.82s)]
*  Now, I think this is a grave injustice to the families that have patiently been waiting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=222.38s)]
*  for real justice for the death of their loved ones. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=229.22s)]
*  Not only the 2,977 killed on 9-11, but also the thousands of others that were killed from [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=232.56s)]
*  very real 9-11-related illnesses. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=241.46s)]
*  They make a plea deal with him, but then they deny having any role in that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=245.22s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=248.5s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=249.5s)]
*  First of all, it's implausible. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=251.5s)]
*  Second, I don't know which is worse, that you had no role in it, that is, you have an [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=254.1s)]
*  administration that's completely out of control, or you did have a role in it, and you made [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=258.22s)]
*  the terrible decision. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=262.06s)]
*  For those who are too young to remember 20-some years ago, I'm still angry about 9-11. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=264.02s)]
*  When I think about the fact that they killed 3,000 innocents in New York in a single moment, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=267.7s)]
*  and inflicted terror on the United States of America, and the mastermind, Khalid Sheikh [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=273.22s)]
*  a radical Islamic terrorist, whether Vice President Harris wants to describe it that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=277.38s)]
*  way or not, a radical Islamic terrorist brought hell to New York City and the American economy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=280.78s)]
*  And they cut a plea deal with him, denying the families the very basic idea of justice [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=286.5s)]
*  being imposed on these horrible criminals who did so much destruction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=291.94s)]
*  I can't believe that they did that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=296.26s)]
*  I can't believe that they actually cut this deal. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=297.7s)]
*  And whether President Biden claims he knew about it or not, he's the commander in chief, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=299.58s)]
*  he's in charge, and he is responsible for this disgraceful action. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=303.38s)]
*  Let me ask you one other important question, because I could not believe, after Iran attacked [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  Israel, and Israel had to retaliate alone, because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, in my [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  view, they surrendered in the war against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  Kamala Harris, I played the tape over and over. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=324.02s)]
*  She said, we should have the courage not to use that word or the word illegal alien. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=326.5s)]
*  But the fact that we abandoned our ally, now we have a situation where they took out the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=332.98s)]
*  leader of Hamas that was inside of Iran, which shocked me the most, even without our help, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=337.46s)]
*  when they did retaliate alone, because America, well, Joe and Kamala abandoned Israel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=344.26s)]
*  They got deep into Iranian territory. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=350.34s)]
*  I didn't think they'd have that capability. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=354.38s)]
*  That tells me they have the ability to take out their refineries and their nuclear sites [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=356.94s)]
*  with or without our help. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=361.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=362.9s)]
*  I'm just a harmless little talk show host observer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=363.9s)]
*  Am I reading that right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, Sean, you've captured the difference quite clearly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  The Israelis are killing terrorists, and we're coddling them, cutting plea deals with them, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=375.38s)]
*  trading terrorists for innocent Americans, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  The juxtaposition between the Israelis trying to deter threats against them and the way [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=382.9s)]
*  The Biden administration has made America weak on the global stages very real. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  We also have seen that the Israelis are very capable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=391.34s)]
*  They have the ability to reach into Tehran in the same way, frankly, that the Trump administration [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=393.82s)]
*  did when we took out al-Qaeda's number two in Tehran. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=398.02s)]
*  The Iranian leadership should be deeply aware of the Israeli capability. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=402.17999999999995s)]
*  And what I wish they could also know is that the United States will support Israel's efforts, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=405.85999999999996s)]
*  whatever that may be, to defend themselves and, frankly, to defend the United States [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=410.82s)]
*  And the Gulf Arab states, from this threat from radical Islamic terrorism that is emanating [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=415.1s)]
*  from Tehran all across, whether it's in Syria or Gaza or from Lebanon and Hezbollah, this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=419.18s)]
*  is a real challenge. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=424.3s)]
*  And the United States cannot sit on the sidelines, or worse, claim that these are morally equivalent [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=425.74s)]
*  propositions between Hamas and the United States. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=430.14s)]
*  They said to Israel, you're on your own. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  They've been pressuring Israel after they lost the equivalent of 40,000 Israelis, what [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=435.3s)]
*  would have been 40,000 Americans in a day, to show restraint, show restraint. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=440.22s)]
*  I don't know if the Iranian missile would have hit that soccer field and killed those [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  kids had they been fighting this war the way it needed to be fought, and that is to win [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  it and win it quickly, as Donald Trump says. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  So I guess, once again, Kamala Harris says you can't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=456.3s)]
*  Why would you have any confidence they would ever support Israel in defending themselves [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  and offensively winning a war? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=467.6s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're right, it's unconscionable. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=470.98s)]
*  And not only do I not have any confidence, but sadly Hamas and Hezbollah and the Iranian [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=473.62s)]
*  leadership, they think America will bail on this as well and won't support our ally. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=478.18s)]
*  And you can be sure, Sean, others are watching as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  The folks in Taiwan, the folks in China, all the bad guys, all our allies are watching [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  how we behave as well. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=489.62s)]

*  And under their watch, Iran got rich. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  They turned a blind eye to the sanctions. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=497.6s)]
*  They gave waivers on sanctions. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=499.44s)]
*  They were willing to pay $6 billion for hostages. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=500.96s)]
*  It's unreal to Iran, the mullahs, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbaQCC5zNM&t=507.56s)]
