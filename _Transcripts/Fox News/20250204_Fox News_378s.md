*  and they can't find over 300,000 of them? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=19.44s)]
*  I guarantee some of these children [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=21.76s)]

*  been raped, murdered, and burned alive? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=38.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's just pathetic. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=40.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, you got some help from President Trump, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=43.92s)]
*  and for now he got Canada and Mexico, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=47.84s)]
*  Colombia, and even Venezuela [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  to accept back these illegal immigrants, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=55.2s)]
*  and you now have Gitmo as a place to put many of them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=57.12s)]
*  How important are those developments to you? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  You know, President Trump proves every day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=65.28s)]

*  Look what we've done. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=72.56s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=73.52s)]
*  Seeing airplanes of illegal aliens land in Gitmo, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=74.24s)]
*  a game changer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=76.72s)]
*  Seeing the Department of Defense [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=77.84s)]
*  take airplanes south of illegal aliens, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=79.84s)]
*  first time in my 34 years of doing this job, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=81.84s)]
*  a game changer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=84.4s)]
*  President Trump's making progress every single day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=85.6s)]
*  Our numbers alreadyâ€” [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=88.96s)]
*  Remember, Sean, it wasn't too long ago [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=90.0s)]
*  we were dealing with 10,000, 11,000 illegal entries a day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=91.52s)]
*  Yesterday, 524. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=94.88s)]
*  And not one of them, not a single one was released. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  They were either returned or detained seeking prosecution. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=99.44s)]
*  So game changer, greatest president in my lifetime [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  proves it every day, and look, we got a lot more to do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=104.64s)]
*  And I got a great team. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=107.92s)]
*  We got the greatest president I've ever worked for. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  We got Secretary Noem. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=111.36s)]
*  She's already been on the ground with the Border Patrol. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=112.8s)]
*  She's been on the ground with ICE. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=114.56s)]
*  She's been on the water with the Coast Guard. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  She's done more enforcement actions in a week [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=117.2s)]
*  than my office has done in four years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=119.52s)]
*  I got Pete Hegseth, shoulder to shoulder with Pete Hegseth, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=121.12s)]
*  giving us all the DOD assets to lock that border town. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=123.44s)]
*  So, you know, what a great team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  We got Steve Miller, the architect, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=127.36s)]
*  He amazes me every day at the White House. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=128.96s)]
*  We have one hell of a team. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  We will not fail this president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me read a headline to you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=133.36s)]
*  Chicago leaders encourage residents to exercise their rights [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=135.68s)]
*  in resisting Trump's deportation policies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=140.08s)]
*  The governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=143.44s)]
*  basically admitted that he knew somebody [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=145.84s)]
*  that didn't have full documentation, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=147.52s)]
*  that he was hiding over his garage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=149.6s)]
*  Then we have Tom Tillis, senator from North Carolina, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=152.48s)]
*  saying that people should have the right [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=155.12s)]
*  to sue sanctuary cities and states [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  that aid in a bet and lawbreaking. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=159.92s)]
*  Your comment on all of that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=161.68s)]
*  Well, I think the government's pretty foolish [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=165.68s)]
*  same way, too, because I've gotten hold of it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Won't let it go. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=171.36s)]
*  We'll look into it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=172.24s)]
*  And if he's knowingly harboring, concealing, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=173.36s)]
*  and illegally harming, that's a violation of Title 8, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=176.24s)]
*  United States Code 1324, I will seek prosecution, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  or the secretary will seek prosecution. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=182.0s)]
*  So maybe he's bluffing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=184.0s)]
*  If he's not, we'll deal with that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=186.24s)]
*  And as far as suing sanctuary cities, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  well, get in line, because the Trump administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=189.44s)]
*  is going to do that already. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=191.28s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are sanctuary for criminals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  There's one example, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  Sanctuary cities in New York City. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  If they would have gave us over the killer of Lake and Riley [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=200.88s)]
*  when he got arrested in New York City [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=204.0s)]
*  for endanger a child, he would have been in jail. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  They would never have killed Lake and Riley. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=208.0s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are responsible for deaths of thousands, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=209.76s)]
*  thousands of young children throughout my career. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=213.76s)]
*  And we're going to sue them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=216.8s)]
*  We're going to hold them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=217.6s)]
*  And look, if he's got to go to Supreme Court, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=218.4s)]
*  that's what President Trump wanted to do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=219.84s)]
*  He will end sanctuary cities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=221.68s)]
*  You know, there was a 2011 Government Accountability Office [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  study found 3 million criminal offenses [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=228.8s)]
*  had been committed by illegal immigrants. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=232.8s)]
*  This is before Harris, Biden, Mayorkas, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=235.28s)]
*  through the floodgates wide open, 12, 14, 15, who knows how. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  How many, do we have any estimates? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  We know there's about 350,000 missing children [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  that have been used by illegal immigrants. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=247.84s)]
*  Do we have any estimates? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  How many Americans have been victims of violent crime, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=251.84s)]
*  murdered and raped? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=254.8s)]
*  Do we have any idea of that number at this point? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=255.84s)]
*  You know, there's really no metric on that, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=261.44s)]
*  because, you know, it's, of course, in the thousands. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=263.04s)]
*  We have no metric because of one reason. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=265.36s)]
*  Many sanctuary cities don't even track the nationality. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=267.6s)]
*  When they book them into jail, they won't ask what country they're from, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=270.32s)]
*  what their immigration status is, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=273.04s)]
*  because they don't want ICE to find out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=274.56s)]
*  So even though we know sanctuary cities are protecting criminals, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=276.32s)]
*  we find out about a lot of them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=278.8s)]
*  There are a lot we don't find out about, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=280.72s)]
*  because they simply won't gather the bi-metrics [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=282.32s)]
*  so we know who they are. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  But again, I think President Trump, this administration, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=286.64s)]
*  are going to sue sanctuary cities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  We need that information. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  Sanctuaries are sanctuaries for criminals. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=292.4s)]
*  Bottom line. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. So what will happen, what will ICE do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  to the politicians, the advocacy groups, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=300.08s)]
*  the cities and states that have sanctuary status [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=304.4s)]
*  that are aiding and abetting in the law breaking? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=307.52s)]
*  What will you do to those people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=310.88s)]
*  that are openly, not just opposing, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=312.8s)]
*  but helping those people that broke the law [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=317.92s)]
*  and didn't respect our borders and sovereignty? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  If they openly impede us as a violation of federal law, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  it's a felony. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=328.64s)]
*  If they knowingly harbor a casino and alien, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=329.6s)]
*  that's a felony. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  We will seek prosecution through the U.S. Attorney's Office. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=333.44s)]
*  We got a great U.S. attorney coming in, Pam Bondi. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=336.64s)]
*  She's all in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  So we're going to seek prosecution, Sean. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=340.16s)]
*  That's what we have to do, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=341.68s)]
*  because the release of public safety threats [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=342.96s)]
*  back in the community, any sanctuary city, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=344.88s)]
*  any elected mayor, city councilman, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=347.44s)]
*  a governor who thinks it's a good idea [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=349.2s)]
*  to release public safety threats back in the community [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=351.44s)]
*  to re-offend, it's just ridiculous. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=354.08s)]
*  We're going to hold them accountable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=356.08s)]
*  The Trump administration will hold them accountable [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=357.2s)]
*  through prosecution. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. Tom Homan, great job. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=361.76s)]
*  Amazing two weeks. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=364.4s)]
*  As you begin your third week, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9tl7lSc9z8&t=365.52s)]
