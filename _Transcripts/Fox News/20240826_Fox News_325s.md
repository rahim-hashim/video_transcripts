# Ted Cruz: Day 1 for Kamala Harris was 4 years ago
**Fox News:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc)
*  Can't make it up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=1.2s)]
*  Ted, Senator, you're feeling the brunt of this in Texas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=3.64s)]
*  You see what she's doing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=8.0s)]
*  She's running. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=9.16s)]
*  She's hiding. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=10.16s)]
*  She's trying to run out the clock. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=11.16s)]
*  And now she says, no tax on tips. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=12.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, she was the tie-breaking vote that empowered the IRS to go after service [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=15.16s)]
*  workers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=19.76s)]
*  She said the border was secure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=20.76s)]
*  She said that inflation was transitory. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=22.32s)]
*  Now she's going to, on day one, fix inflation, fix the border and solve all our problems? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=24.96s)]
*  Well, look, Kamala is running a fundamentally dishonest campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=30.68s)]
*  You know, you reference just there day one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=37.04s)]
*  Day one was four years ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=39.04s)]
*  Part of what's fundamentally dishonest about the campaign is she's pretending that she's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=41.08s)]
*  not the sitting vice president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=45.32s)]
*  She's pretending that Joe Biden is not currently the president of the United States, that these [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=47.0s)]
*  problems are all of her own making, that the inflation we have is because of the wild spending [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=51.92s)]
*  and debt that she and Joe Biden and the Democrats did. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  The open border, she's been the border czar for four years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  This invasion is her fault, not only her fault, but she wanted it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=63.96s)]
*  Listen, I've served with Kamala for years in the Senate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=68.16s)]
*  She has consistently been the most left-wing senator. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  She's voted for open borders over and over and over again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=74.28s)]
*  And now this entire election, she's trying to pretend her record doesn't exist. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=78.76s)]
*  Sean, it's why she doesn't do media interviews. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  It's why she won't answer questions, because they are very cynically trying to hide her [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  in the basement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=90.76s)]
*  I think it's Joe Biden's basement. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=91.76s)]
*  And I'll point out, by the way, my reelection campaign in Texas, my opponent, Congressman [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=93.42s)]
*  Colin Allred, every bit as left-wing as Kamala Harris, he's doing the same strategy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=98.04s)]
*  He's been over 60 days without doing a press conference. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't answer questions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=106.12s)]
*  I think Joe Biden and Kamala and Colin Allred are all in the same basement, and they're [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=107.56s)]
*  all there for the same reason, which is they cannot defend their left-wing open borders [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=112.56s)]
*  record. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  So far, they've gotten away with it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  So far, your opponent has gotten away with it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And I was asking this question of Newt Gingrich, and he said, well, it's the Trump campaign's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=130.16s)]
*  But the clock is not on our side here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=131.16s)]
*  The early voting begins in Pennsylvania three weeks from tomorrow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=135.16s)]
*  We have mail-in ballots going out in North Carolina before then, and other states rolling [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=139.04s)]
*  out very quickly, including Wisconsin and Michigan, Senator. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=144.4s)]
*  This is a serious crisis for our country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=149.2s)]
*  Now they want, last minute, the debate they requested, with the rules they requested, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=151.72s)]
*  with the rules they agreed to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=155.88s)]
*  Oh, we either demand a change or what? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  Now she doesn't want to debate either? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=159.8s)]
*  My guess is she doesn't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  My guess is, and if I'm Donald Trump, I don't think you can give in anymore. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=163.52s)]
*  I don't think you should ever agree to a debate on ABC. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  The questions, in my mind, are going to be written by George Stephanopoulos. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=172.96s)]
*  So, they are going to be written by George Stephanopoulos. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=177.56s)]
*  But look, Sean, I think Trump needs to do the debate, and frankly, I think he should [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  agree to whatever stupid rules they want. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=186.08s)]
*  It's going to be hostile and rigged regardless. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=187.96s)]
*  And I think Kamala Harris would love to cancel the debate and blame it on Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, she's in a basement. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=195.04s)]
*  They don't want her challenged ever. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=196.48s)]
*  If they have an excuse to get out of a debate, they can literally do nothing for the next [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  71 days except count on the corporate media to lie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=202.6s)]
*  So, wait a minute. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=205.04s)]
*  So, what if Trump says— [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=206.04s)]
*  And so, I think that Trump— [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=207.04s)]
*  Well, what if he says, we already agreed to the rules, either accept the debate that you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=208.04s)]
*  agreed to or, you know, walk away and hide. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=212.88s)]
*  Don't you think she ends up looking bad on that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=216.2s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  I think she'd be happy to walk away from that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  My advice would be come up with whatever stupid rules you want. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=225.4s)]
*  If you want her to wear a cheese head while she's debating, you want the mics hot or [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=229.8s)]
*  not, you want her to have an encyclopedia of talking points in front of her, I don't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=233.0s)]
*  care. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to stand up directly and contrast her record and mine, because on every front, Donald [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump's record, we had success in this country, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had record [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=243.36s)]
*  low unemployment, we had a secure border, we had peace globally, and on every level, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=248.04s)]
*  Kamala's record is a train wreck. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=253.08s)]
*  And so, my advice to the Trump campaign is, is don't get—Kamala wants to pick this fight [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=254.76s)]
*  to have an excuse to get out of the debate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=259.92s)]
*  Don't let her out of the debate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=262.0s)]
*  We need her there, because without a debate, her campaign will never answer a single question [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=263.56s)]
*  between now and election day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=268.64s)]
*  And that's their only hope of winning is focus on joy and hope he changes stuff— [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=270.48s)]
*  Well, then how about this? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=274.04s)]
*  And not her disastrous record. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=275.04s)]
*  Trump is known for the art of the deal. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=278.0s)]
*  How about this deal? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=279.4s)]
*  I'll agree to your rule change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=280.4s)]
*  You agree to a second debate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  And then put the ball back in her court. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=285.84s)]
*  Look, I think he can try— [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=287.56s)]
*  It's the art of the deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=288.56s)]
*  I think he can try, but she'll say no. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=289.56s)]
*  She'll say no. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=292.2s)]
*  She will not agree to a Fox debate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=293.2s)]
*  By the way, Trump is happy to go in front of whatever communists you put in front of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=295.32s)]
*  him as the moderators. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=298.64s)]
*  They're all hostile to him, because he's got the truth in her hands. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  She's trying to lie and cover up her record. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=302.88s)]
*  All in all, Red, my opponent's doing the exact same thing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=305.48s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  We're watching your campaign very closely as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ynS6aCbYc&t=312.6s)]
