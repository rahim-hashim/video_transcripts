# Bret Baier unveils inside look into Kamala Harris interview
**Fox News:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c)
*  As our very own, he's the host of Special Report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=0.0s)]
*  I think he took all the joy out of the Kamala Harris campaign today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  She didn't look particularly joyous doing this interview, but I thought you did a great [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  job with a very limited amount of time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=11.64s)]
*  And I just want—take us behind the scenes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=14.9s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=17.04s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, thanks, Sean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=18.04s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=20.04s)]
*  It was a little tense. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=23.12s)]
*  We were given the time of 5 p.m. Eastern Time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=25.64s)]
*  Obviously, my show is at 6 p.m. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  They wanted the tape at 5 p.m. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=31.12s)]
*  We said we were going to tape as live, in other words, roll the tape and then just turn [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=33.2s)]
*  that around, unedited, uninterrupted. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  But we had to do it before 5 p.m. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=40.88s)]
*  Otherwise, we couldn't turn the whole machine around before the top of the 6 p.m. show. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=43.28s)]
*  So we were waiting at 4.55 and then 5 and then 5.05 and then 5.10. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=47.6s)]
*  At 5.17, the vice president walked out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=54.56s)]
*  So it did feel a little bit like they were icing the kicker or trying to. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=60.04s)]
*  And originally, they were talking about 25 minutes, and they gave us 20 minutes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=65.24s)]
*  And I was fine with any time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=69.12s)]
*  I was really happy to get the interview. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=70.84s)]
*  But I knew right away, when we started asking questions, when I started asking questions, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=74.0s)]
*  that this was kind of a sense that she was going to keep on talking and that if I wanted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=79.36s)]
*  to get through and redirect, I was going to have to interrupt. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=84.88s)]
*  I don't particularly love to do that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=89.0s)]
*  But if I didn't do it, there may have been, you know, four answers in the interview. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=92.08s)]
*  Well, I don't really think you had any choice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=96.16s)]
*  And for people that don't understand the time in TV, if somebody's trying to filibuster [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=99.0s)]
*  or avoiding a direct question, which you did repeatedly, or just going off and using that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=103.84s)]
*  every moment to attack her opponent, as I think she did often in this, in this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  What I did like about what you did, I'm guessing you probably had 50 questions in your arsenal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  that you were ready to ask, questions you would have loved to have gotten to. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm guessing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=124.28s)]
*  Yeah, 75. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=125.28s)]
*  But what I noticed, and I think you had to do, is for example, you did spend a significant [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=126.28s)]
*  amount of time on immigration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=131.84s)]
*  Now, I played a lot of tape at the beginning of this show. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=133.4s)]
*  She wants to decriminalize the illegal immigration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=136.6s)]
*  She said it in her own words. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=139.08s)]
*  She wants free housing, health care, education, sex change surgeries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  She's on tape saying it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  You brought up Tim Wall's position, driver's licenses, free college, a path to citizenship [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  amnesty. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=152.44s)]
*  They rescinded all the Trump, and they said it proudly, all the Trump policies that were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  working. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=160.56s)]
*  Trump's chart that he loves so much shows that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=162.24s)]
*  That's the chart that saved his life in Butler, PA. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=166.2s)]
*  And she just denied it and wouldn't answer it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  I was more shocked at her lack of apology to people that died by these unvetted illegal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=171.04s)]
*  immigrants that came in because of their policies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=179.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=182.64s)]
*  So I studied how she's answered immigration before, and it really does go through a TikTok. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  She says when they first arrived in office, they put forward this bill, and it didn't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  go through, but she doesn't talk about the bill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=195.72s)]
*  It was an amnesty bill for 11 million illegal aliens inside the country over eight years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=198.64s)]
*  They had control of the White House, the Senate and the House, and yet the Democratic leadership [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=205.84s)]
*  didn't put that bill forward, and the White House really didn't even push it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=210.52s)]
*  But she starts there, and then she says there's this evolution. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=215.04s)]
*  She tried to do all these things with the president, and then they had this comprehensive [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=218.6s)]
*  effort, this bipartisan bill. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=222.0s)]
*  The bipartisan bill was voted against by eight Democrats, and it had some major problems [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=225.36s)]
*  that conservatives didn't like. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  There were about 1.8 million illegal immigrants that would be let in every year, and there [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  were all kinds of other stipulations that conservatives didn't like, so it didn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  have a chance. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=239.68s)]
*  She says that these things happened very quickly, the one bill and the other bill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  There were three and a half years in between them, and in that time, 94 executive orders [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  among them, catch and release, and remain in Mexico. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=251.32s)]
*  And that's why a lot of these people were released. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=256.0s)]
*  It's, you know, there's different numbers, but if you go by the Homeland Security Secretary, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  85 percent of the apprehensions, it's more than 6 million people, and some of them committed [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=264.2s)]
*  heinous crimes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=271.4s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to go down that road at the beginning, and I spent a lot of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=272.76s)]
*  time on it, but I thought nobody else would go into that depth, and I figured it was worth it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=276.48s)]
*  I think it was enlightening, and I think if you didn't follow up and you didn't press [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=284.0s)]
*  it and you didn't inform viewers about what was actually in that bill, because you're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=287.56s)]
*  right, she gives the same answer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  The only answer that I got to give her credit she didn't use is she didn't say, did you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  know I came from a middle-class family? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=298.76s)]
*  I expected that answer at some point. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=300.92s)]
*  At one point, you reminded her that she had been in power for three and a half years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=303.56s)]
*  She has been saying on the campaign trail she will fix inflation on day one. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=309.76s)]
*  She will deal with the border on day one. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  Wasn't day one January 20th, 2021, and then at one point she said, well, you know what [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=317.44s)]
*  I mean, and you said, no, I really don't. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  Explain that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I really didn't. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, I played the soundbites. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=330.56s)]
*  She had a couple of bites at the Apple and a couple of shows. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=333.64s)]
*  The View, Stephen Colbert essentially asked the same question. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=336.12s)]
*  She did it on The View. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  It got a lot of attention. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  I think Stephen Colbert maybe asked it again to try to give a clean-up operation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=343.28s)]
*  I played those soundbites for her and essentially thinking they have to have a different answer [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=348.0s)]
*  now, you know, this many days later. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=352.68s)]
*  And it really didn't have that much substance differently, saying that she would do something [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=356.52s)]
*  differently. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=361.36s)]
*  So the theme of the campaign is a new way forward and turn the page. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=362.44s)]
*  And what I said was, if you're turning the page, who are you turning the page on? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  You were the vice president for the last three and a half years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=372.56s)]
*  And obviously went with some follow-ups. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=376.44s)]
*  When she said, you know what I'm talking about, Donald Trump has been running for 10 [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=378.16s)]
*  years, I honestly, I was just being honest. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  I didn't know what she was talking about. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=384.8s)]
*  And I was trying to get at what she was saying. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=387.04s)]
*  So the Harris campaign knew that this was going to air tonight. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=390.44s)]
*  You say that she finally got in the chair at 517. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=393.84s)]
*  You have to turn this around by 6 p.m. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=398.04s)]
*  Not an easy task in television. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=401.32s)]
*  They had given you a hard 30 minutes, no more. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=403.28s)]
*  And my understanding is they were even trying to wrap you up. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=407.48s)]
*  Actually it was 25 and then it went to 20. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=410.0s)]
*  Oh, so they cut back on the time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=412.24s)]
*  And you know that they're cutting back. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=415.36s)]
*  It's just not exactly easy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=418.28s)]
*  How did it end? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=420.32s)]
*  We know how it started. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=421.56s)]
*  When she left, how was her campaign? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=423.36s)]
*  How was she to you when she left? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=425.88s)]
*  Yeah, Ms. Cordill. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=428.36s)]
*  And I said thank you so much, Madam Vice President, for the time. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=431.0s)]
*  She said thank you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=434.04s)]
*  Her people, like probably four people, were wrapping me, you know, with big, you know, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=435.68s)]
*  moving arms. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=441.0s)]
*  That's why I looked down to the side and said I've got to wrap up. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  You want to keep talking. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=446.68s)]
*  You want to keep asking questions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=447.68s)]
*  But they were very animated. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=449.0s)]
*  And listen, I hope she comes back. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=452.2s)]
*  I actually think this is a different take. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=454.44s)]
*  I think she had a mission that she wanted to do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=457.0s)]
*  And maybe she wanted to have a viral moment. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=463.12s)]
*  She wanted to have a pushback. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  She came to Fox News and she wanted to have a go after Donald Trump viral moment that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=467.24s)]
*  plays on a lot of other channels and on social media. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=472.96s)]
*  And I think she may have gotten that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=476.08s)]
*  I think in the interim, we had a good exchange. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  I wish it wasn't so much filler buster. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=481.0s)]
*  I wish it was just a cordial conversation about policy and follow ups. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=482.92s)]
*  Maybe if we had more time, maybe she'll come back. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=488.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if she will or not, but I hope she does. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  And obviously, I hope the former president does the same format. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  Very enlightening. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=497.6s)]
*  I walked away with a feeling of I think I kind of understand why they don't want tough [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=498.6s)]
*  interviews and this will be the last one I think that they ever do. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  You did your job and you were fair. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=507.68s)]
*  You were tough. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=510.2s)]
*  You followed up. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=511.2s)]
*  You pressed her. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  And in a very short period of time, we appreciate you sharing your time with us tonight. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Brett. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0MxcUXW9c&t=517.56s)]
