# We have a surge in Chinese migrants: Sara Carter
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A)
*  Carter has been monitoring the situation at the southern border all month, and she joins us now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=0.0s)]
*  with more. Sarah, there's a lot to be alarmed by, but to me, these 24,000 Chinese migrants, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=4.8s)]
*  Gordon Chang said one of the possibilities that came to his mind when he heard about this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=12.08s)]
*  was either ministry of state security agents or Chinese military coming into our country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=16.72s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=23.52s)]
*  Oh, I can absolutely agree with Gordon Chang on that. He's also a friend of mine and somebody [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=24.08s)]
*  who I highly respect. And he has traveled throughout the region. He and I have been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=30.88s)]
*  to the Far East together where he has given a number of speeches. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=35.68s)]
*  We've been watching and monitoring China as well as other adversaries such as Venezuela and Iran, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=39.76s)]
*  Russia. They are all taking advantage of this crisis at our southern border, Kayleigh. Think [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  about this. The United Nations is now stating, and this is the second time that they have done [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=52.24s)]
*  this, that the land crossing between the United States and Mexico is the most dangerous land [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=57.36s)]
*  crossing in the world, the most dangerous land crossing in the world. We have people coming into [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  our country from all over the world. They're not getting background checks. Immigration and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=68.08s)]
*  customs enforcement are basically throwing their hands up in the air. The Biden administration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=72.88s)]
*  is allowing them to come in. So they're aiding and abetting these traffickers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=77.68s)]
*  But it's not just about the cartels, right? We already know this. We know that the cartels [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=82.0s)]
*  are being used as proxies by the Chinese government to move in fentanyl. We've lost over 112,000 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Americans, many of them young, to fentanyl poisoning and fentanyl overdose. We are looking [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=93.12s)]
*  at Chinese migrants. The surge is absolutely incredible. We can't even get background checks [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  on them because the Chinese government is not cooperating with us because they don't want to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=104.08s)]
*  cooperate with us. This is part of breaking the back of America. And what Gordon Chang is saying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=108.32s)]
*  is important, and I'll wrap up on Gordon Chang's thoughts on this. Look, when people come into this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=114.08s)]
*  country and they disappear into the fabric of America, they can be anybody. They can be found [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=118.96s)]
*  spying on our installations, our government installations. They could be scuba diving, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=123.92s)]
*  you know, in our ports of entry and collecting data on us. They could be delivering food to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=129.52s)]
*  buildings, acting as couriers, but really placing, you know, technology and equipment that they could [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=135.68s)]
*  use to spy on us. Our agencies are well aware of this. The problem is they just aren't stopping it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=142.56s)]
*  And nobody knows how far this is going to go before we actually break. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And Sarah, I have just a moment here, but CNN's reporting that this number of migrants [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=154.56s)]
*  south of our border, north of Mexico, could be as much as 15,000 migrants on top of these record [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=161.44s)]
*  numbers. Yeah, absolutely. I just spoke with the source who was saying the same to me and that they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=168.4s)]
*  are expecting that this caravan, this new caravan to swell. Now remember, Maduro in Venezuela is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=174.72s)]
*  very active at looking at what he can do. And this is not just me saying this. We have U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=182.8s)]
*  intelligence officers investigating this right now in Central America, looking at how Maduro [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=188.4s)]
*  is handling this, moving people. We don't even know if some of these people are coming out of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  prisons. We don't understand how they're just forming into these large caravans and then moving [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  and collecting people on the way. And this isn't just about our own national security. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=205.68s)]
*  For Democrats out there that have concerns about the humanitarian crisis and Republicans, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=210.4s)]
*  there are children in these caravans that are losing their lives on the way to our country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=216.8s)]
*  They will never make it. They're being taken by these cartels and these human traffickers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=221.84s)]
*  They are being sold into the most heinous and nefarious, I don't even want to say, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=226.88s)]
*  pedophilia rings. That's the only way to describe it. And even when they come to the United States, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=232.56s)]
*  many of them disappear. So Kayleigh, like I say with Tom Homan all the time, and he says this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=238.48s)]
*  every single time he's on Sean's show, what is so good about leaving this border wide open? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=243.92s)]
*  Why is our government doing this and why is nobody stopping it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, why is the question? Sarah Carter, thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkcElK25z_A&t=254.95999999999998s)]
