# Mark Levin: We have Hitler Youth on our college campuses
**Fox News:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM)
*  Vile anti-Semitic protests continue to wreak havoc on college campuses all across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, the University of Southern California canceled their main commencement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=7.2s)]
*  ceremony. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=12.88s)]
*  They also announced the campus would be shut down until further notice following yesterday's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=13.88s)]
*  protests, which led to nearly 100 arrests. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=18.52s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction to that and much more, he is the host of Life, Liberty and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=21.04s)]
*  Levin as his own syndicated radio show. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=25.16s)]
*  I call him the great one, Mark Levin. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=27.76s)]
*  You know, I'm sitting here with three great topics. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=29.84s)]
*  I want your thoughts on Biden surrendering in the war on terror, stabbing Israel in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=39.08s)]
*  I want your take on the oral arguments on immunity in the Supreme Court today and this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=40.08s)]
*  insane trial in New York. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=45.56s)]
*  I only have six minutes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=47.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=48.68s)]
*  Take it from here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=49.68s)]
*  Well, it might be tough. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=50.68s)]
*  I'll do my best. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=51.68s)]
*  Let's start with the Hitler youth on our college and university campuses. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=54.2s)]
*  Joe Biden has gaslit this entire thing with his comments about Israel, his attacks on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=59.16s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu, his attacks on Israel trying to defend itself against Gaza and all the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=64.2s)]
*  rest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=70.08s)]
*  Joe Biden is responsible for much of the hate, and that's why he doesn't stand up like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=71.08s)]
*  a man, like a statesman and put it down and say it in unequivocal terms. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=75.28s)]
*  This isn't about Palestine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=80.22s)]
*  This is about terrorism on our college campuses. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=82.24s)]
*  Joe Biden has been on the wrong side, whether it was race and bigotry when he walked into [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=85.48s)]
*  the Senate, and now it's anti-Semitism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  He's the anti-Semite president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  That's what he is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=95.16s)]
*  The Third Reich in the ivory tower has been written about. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=96.32s)]
*  The Third Reich in the ivory tower, Hitler's American friends, it's been written about, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=99.36s)]
*  buried by the times, the American media, they're all back. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=104.6s)]
*  The Democrat Party, the Hitler youth on our campuses. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=107.8s)]
*  And let me make a suggestion, America. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=111.38s)]
*  Aren't you sick of paying for this? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=113.6s)]
*  We need a BDS movement, a boycott, divest and sanction movement for all of these universities [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=115.6s)]
*  and colleges. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  Start defunding them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=122.88s)]
*  Start defunding them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=124.64s)]
*  Start eliminating tenure for these sanctimonious Marxist Islamist professors. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=126.36s)]
*  Take our college campuses back from the Soviet-style fanatics that run them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=131.78s)]
*  We don't have to have these no-go zones in our country, these universities in our country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  Notice, they're all in Democrat cities, almost all in Democrat states. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=143.24s)]
*  This isn't happening among Republicans and so forth, but I want to point out something [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=147.88s)]
*  about the Supreme Court case, since you brought that up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=152.36s)]
*  Let me say something that hasn't been said yet. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  The court is sitting there trying to be King Solomon and decide how they're going to cut [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=159.02s)]
*  up the baby, cut the baby in half. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  And King Solomon said, no. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=166.68s)]
*  And the mother of the baby said, no, no, no, no, don't do it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Give it to the fraud. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=172.6s)]
*  Give the baby to the fraud. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=173.6s)]
*  Let me explain something. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=174.6s)]
*  Since the beginning of this country, since elections, we have never had a situation where [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=177.72s)]
*  elections have been criminalized by the government. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  They talk about fake electors. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=187.04s)]
*  In 1876, three Republican states had a second set of electors. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=188.64s)]
*  They're not fake electors. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=193.68s)]
*  They're electors that are set. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=195.12s)]
*  Congress makes the final decision. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=196.72s)]
*  There's nothing criminal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=198.44s)]
*  There's nothing obstructive about it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=199.72s)]
*  A president or a candidate calling a speaker of the House, calling a board of elections [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  official, calling a governor, so what? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=206.28s)]
*  Big deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=209.24s)]
*  They're allowed to do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=210.24s)]
*  That's not obstruction. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=211.56s)]
*  That's not a crime either. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=212.88s)]
*  Or trying to get a legislature to bring their laws back to what they were before the Democrats [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=214.72s)]
*  were in there litigating. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=219.36s)]
*  That's not a crime either. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  They keep talking about overturning election. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  An election is decided by the United States Congress that meets in joint session to count [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=225.56s)]
*  the electoral college votes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Ask Jamie the Red Raskin, who jumps up every time and objected to two times George W. Bush [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  being elected president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=239.36s)]
*  Ask them when they jumped up in 2016. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  Said, don't count the electors. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=242.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's not the real president. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=244.96s)]
*  These challenges happen all the time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=247.24s)]
*  And yes, even when John Aisman said to Vice President Pence, we recommend that you don't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  do this, that you do that, that's not a crime either. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=255.12s)]
*  In 1876, that's exactly what happened. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=258.76s)]
*  How come Rutherford B. Hayes wasn't charged? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=261.68s)]
*  How come the electors in Florida and Louisiana weren't charged? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=264.42s)]
*  How come all of a sudden, all of a sudden, this entire electoral process is criminalized [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=267.8s)]
*  where today we don't know what's even legal anymore? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=274.72s)]
*  You can't have a slate of electors. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=277.68s)]
*  We used to do that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=279.16s)]
*  You can't call a board of elections official. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=280.32s)]
*  We used to do that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=282.72s)]
*  You can't lobby a governor. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  You can't lobby Congress. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=285.08s)]
*  The Democrats have done this all the time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=286.52s)]
*  Let me just say this, Supreme Court, you made a big mistake. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  And all the legal analysts, too, they're sitting there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  What's an official act? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=294.96s)]
*  What's a private act? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=296.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=297.08s)]
*  You're not Solomon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=298.08s)]
*  This should not be criminalized. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=300.0s)]
*  We have an electoral system, a political system. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  We have states. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=303.96s)]
*  We have a Congress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=304.96s)]
*  They should sort the things out, not you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  That's why you can't figure out what to do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=308.52s)]
*  This immunity stuff, you were dragged into, you were dragged into Jack Smith's world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  When you were dragged in it before, you ruled 8-0 against him, when it involved Bob McDonald [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=315.96s)]
*  in Virginia. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=320.4s)]
*  He's twisted the Constitution. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=321.4s)]
*  He's criminalized the election using the 1871 Klan Act, for God's sakes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=323.08s)]
*  He's using the Enron Act, which you're now looking at and seeing if that's constitutional, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=329.64s)]
*  and a federal contractor act. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=334.96s)]
*  He looked for anything he could to go after Donald Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=337.14s)]
*  He has weaponized this process. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  You do not criminalize the political process. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=343.5s)]
*  You do not criminalize the electoral process. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=346.58s)]
*  And now you have Democrat district attorneys running loose doing the same thing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=349.34s)]
*  Supreme Court, have the guts to put this back in the box. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=353.22s)]
*  I don't care what the commentators on CNN and MSNBC say. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=357.18s)]
*  Have the guts to say, wait a minute. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=361.34s)]
*  Courts, get the hell out of this business. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=363.86s)]
*  This is not up to us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9imYtmP4HYM&t=366.86s)]
