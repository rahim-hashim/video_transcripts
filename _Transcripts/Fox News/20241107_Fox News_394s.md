# Bret Baier: This outcome is an indictment of the media industrial complex
**Fox News:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0)
*  All right, here with more reaction to last night's results is The Anchor, right here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  on Fox News, of Special Report. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Our own Brett Baer is with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=6.74s)]
*  You know, we've been through a number of elections together. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=8.74s)]
*  If you really—if you just think back, in all that we've gone through—we have a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=11.84s)]
*  change in candidates, sadly, you know, two would-be assassins. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=15.84s)]
*  You have all of these things. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=21.56s)]
*  You have lawfare going on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=22.92s)]
*  At the same time, a president, a former president in a mugshot, you have people wanting to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=25.26s)]
*  put them in jail. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=30.02s)]
*  I can't think of a time that it has been this wild of a ride. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=31.86s)]
*  What is your, you know, big picture take on all this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=36.78s)]
*  Yeah, good evening, Sean. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=40.42s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=41.9s)]
*  I think it's surreal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=43.02s)]
*  I think that what we've seen in this election, we will never see again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=44.9s)]
*  What transpired from June 27th in that debate, where we saw President Biden really just kind [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=50.54s)]
*  of implode, and then the change of the nominee, the two assassination attempts, all that we've [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=58.06s)]
*  been through, the debate, my interview with Kamala Harris, you know, you look at what [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=64.86s)]
*  transpired and how she developed her campaign. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=70.9s)]
*  I'm fascinated by the kind of recriminations, the autopsy that the Democrats are doing on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=73.98s)]
*  day one, and it's sort of all over the map. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  They're saying there's all kinds of things wrong. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=84.22s)]
*  But the bottom line is that the people who voted for the former president said, you're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=88.14s)]
*  not listening to me, is at least what we got out of the Fox News voter analysis. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=94.1s)]
*  The economy matters to me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=100.58s)]
*  I'm paying too much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=102.02s)]
*  Inflation matters to me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=103.86s)]
*  Immigration matters to me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=105.78s)]
*  I really don't like the woke stuff. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=107.42s)]
*  I really don't like my kids going into a bathroom with a man who identifies as a woman. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=109.7s)]
*  That matters to me. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  And others didn't hear that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=117.14s)]
*  And so I think we're in a different place. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=119.3s)]
*  And really, the indictment is on the media industrial complex that no longer has a bullhorn, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=123.02s)]
*  because despite everything that everybody said, people voted and they voted for former [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=130.1s)]
*  President Trump in big numbers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=135.54s)]
*  You know, it's funny, and I was discussing this a little bit when I was a guest on your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=138.22s)]
*  show and great coverage last night and great ratings last night and a little bit with with [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=142.9s)]
*  Brit Hume. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=148.06s)]
*  And that is, you know, in many ways, the media industrial complex, as you call it, or I affectionately [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=149.06s)]
*  refer to as the state run media mob. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  But if you look at the big three networks, if you look at all these left wing cable channels, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=157.9s)]
*  if you look at the major newspapers in this country, the trust in media has never been [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=164.42s)]
*  lower. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=170.94s)]
*  And I would argue that their power, quote, influence is wane to the point where they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=172.62s)]
*  threw everything they could possibly throw at Donald Trump united and the American people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=179.18s)]
*  didn't listen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  They didn't pay attention. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  And they went in an entirely different direction. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=190.06s)]
*  To me, we're going to look back at this moment for the media. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  I said in 2007, journalism is dead. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=196.94s)]
*  I'd say legacy media is dead, gone and buried. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=199.9s)]
*  Is that a fair statement? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=203.62s)]
*  It may be, Sean. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  And listen, I really like having you on the show, as did Martha. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think it really added something. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  And you said, listen, I'm going to make a prediction and I don't mean to go over my [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  skis, but I'm going over my skis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  And and it turned out to be right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  It turned out to be dead right across the board. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=220.46s)]
*  The blue wall became the red wall. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  It was really great to have you on and have that that insight and perspective. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  I do think that this is a big moment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  This election shows, despite everything, the fascism, the Nazism, the Madison Square Garden [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=231.78s)]
*  was a Nazi rally, the focus on the comedian that was three hours before the former president [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  got on, the focus that that was going to somehow influence Puerto Rican vote across the country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  The first indication of that was Osceola County in Florida, where Puerto Rican vote was over [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=249.78s)]
*  the charts as far as turnout. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=254.7s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=257.42s)]
*  It was over the top supporting former President Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=258.02s)]
*  He has changed the dynamic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=261.86s)]
*  It is a realignment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=264.34s)]
*  And Donald Trump in 2016 broke some of my colleagues in the media. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=266.14s)]
*  They didn't think about it the right way. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=271.74s)]
*  They became too emotional about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  I think he has broken it again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=277.54s)]
*  And we'll see how they cover it this time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  I think fake news will be forever branded into the foreheads, if you will, of the brands [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  of these companies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  You know, Brett, I look back on this election. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=289.17999999999995s)]
*  There was only one person that I can think of that really challenged Kamala Harris. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=293.02s)]
*  And one of my big frustrations, she never had to answer, you know, why she doesn't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=297.5s)]
*  want to say radical Islamic terrorism, why she co-sponsored the Green New Deal and wanted [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  the elimination of the filibuster to pass it with Bernie Sanders or, you know, Medicare, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=307.86s)]
*  government health care for all, no private health insurance. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=314.18s)]
*  She didn't answer any of them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=316.74s)]
*  But from my vantage point, you're the only one that even attempted, in a very limited [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=317.94s)]
*  window that they gave you, to get answers to real questions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=326.18s)]
*  Nobody else did it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=330.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, John. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I think, listen, it would have benefited her as a candidate to have more [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=335.78s)]
*  of those exchanges. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=340.42s)]
*  It would have benefited probably the Democratic Party to have some kind of, you know, farm [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=341.42s)]
*  club where you're going through interviews and answering questions. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=348.02s)]
*  The interesting part is that other interviews happened after me that asked the same questions. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=351.34s)]
*  And they were, you know, if you're turning the page, how can you say that you're different [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=356.9s)]
*  than President Biden? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=360.78s)]
*  Didn't work. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=362.34s)]
*  She didn't have an answer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=363.78s)]
*  And I think that's part of the authenticity that caused your problems in this election. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=364.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=369.02s)]
*  I think that interview will be remembered for a long time, in large part because you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=370.02s)]
*  were the only one that did it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=374.29999999999995s)]
*  And I tip my hat to you for that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=375.82s)]
*  Great coverage last night. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for letting me be a small part of it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=378.38s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=379.38s)]
*  But a great time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcH4VEDkzZ0&t=380.38s)]
