# Stephen Miller: Eric Adams was a fraud then and he's one now
**Fox News:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s)
*  And you heard her. She just mentioned it, New York City and the tradeoffs they're making based on the money they're spending. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, not long ago in twenty twenty one, Democrat New York City Mayor Eric Adams vowed to cherish and protect all illegals. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=5.76s)]
*  He said this, quote, We need to ensure that undocumented immigrants receive health care and protection, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=13.8s)]
*  that ICE is never in a position to partner with the police department and harm them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=20.16s)]
*  We also need to make sure we treat them with respect and dignity, the dignity they deserve. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=25.4s)]
*  Also, according to Eric Adams, the tired, the poor and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free are all welcome in the Big Apple. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Ha ha ha. That was then and this is now with nearly seventy thousand illegal immigrants in New York City shelters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  You heard that right. And more on the way every single day. Mayor Adams is no longer so virtuous. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=47.72s)]
*  In fact, thanks to a new emergency order in the city, Adams will be turning away buses full of migrants, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  illegals, if they don't meet certain conditions. Mayor Adams' new message to illegals is simple. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  Don't come to New York City. You're not welcome. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=68.28s)]
*  Here now with reaction, former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller and Florida congressman, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=72.4s)]
*  Representative Michael Wall. Stephen, did he believe it then? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  And now it's just too tough to be that virtuous anymore. Or is it political? Why the about face? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=80.68s)]
*  He was a fraud then and he is a fraud now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=89.64s)]
*  And I will tell you why, because if he actually cared at all about the safety and security of the people of New York City, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=92.48s)]
*  he would terminate his status as a sanctuary city. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=99.92s)]
*  And he would announce immediately that the New York City authorities, the police departments, the rent department, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=103.76s)]
*  the housing department, every single institution in the city will be taking down immigration information, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=111.92s)]
*  taking down immigration status, forwarding to the federal government and making sure that the next administration [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  will have that information to carry out deportations. He could do that right now, but he does not do it because he's still a faithful servant, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  a faithful member of the Democrat Party who is committed in his heart to a regime of open borders. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=131.36s)]
*  And until he says we want these people to be deported out of the country, I don't take seriously one word out of the mayor's mouth. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=137.84s)]
*  Well, you know, he has said very recently, it's not that we don't want that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  We just need to spread them out equally across the country. There are over 100000 towns and cities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  Why can't everyone have the amount of illegals that New York City has? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=154.96s)]
*  But Representative Walz, I noticed that Florida is not having this problem. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=159.0s)]
*  The weather is a lot nicer there, it would be a much better destination. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=162.92s)]
*  This is actually a policy question. Like, why aren't illegals going to Florida? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=166.2s)]
*  Why are they going to New York? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=170.48s)]
*  Well, actually, Pete, there may be. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=174.2s)]
*  We can't get a straight answer from the Department of Justice and from DHS on exactly where these people are being shipped in the middle of the night [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=177.6s)]
*  and in what numbers and how they're being taken care of. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=186.6s)]
*  But you know what's so rich from from Mayor Adams and also the mayor of Denver, the mayor of Chicago is, I mean, in the case of New York, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=191.92s)]
*  this is 67000 that he's having to deal with out of the over 10 million in the New York City metropolitan area. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=200.76s)]
*  Look, that's a fraction of his population. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=211.48s)]
*  But you look at the border communities in Arizona, Texas and elsewhere. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=214.24s)]
*  I mean, you're talking 100 to 200 percent of their population. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=219.0s)]
*  So why is it OK all these years that Texas's hospitals, schools, infrastructure and their dollars are being exhausted and their citizens, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=223.76s)]
*  their veterans aren't getting the services that they need. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=233.52s)]
*  But suddenly, when New Yorkers are barely affected with a fraction of their population, then it's a national emergency. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=236.32s)]
*  And here's one other thing, Pete, the solution when you actually pull the thread, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=243.84s)]
*  whether it's Adams or the Democrats in Washington, D.C., the solution is to throw more money at it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=247.56s)]
*  We should have more shelters. We should have more hotel rooms. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=253.48s)]
*  And they're frustrated with Biden because he's not spending more money, not because he's going to actually close down, not closing down the border. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=257.16s)]
*  And I promise you, if the Democrats get their way, all they will do is just flood more of our viewers, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=265.24s)]
*  your viewers, taxpayer dollars at this problem rather than actually just change policies and go back to what President Trump did, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  which is force the most left wing president in Mexican modern history to put his National Guard on his southern border and shut it down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=280.4s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  First of all, their budget is already a disaster in New York. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=293.28s)]
*  But, Stephen, what they do is then they say, here's all this money, here's all these hotel rooms, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=296.96s)]
*  here's all these resources for illegals, yet there are homeless vets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=302.4s)]
*  There are people in any of the five bureaus who can't get basic services. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=306.44s)]
*  To me, this is the inversion completely of America First, the rejection of American citizens on behalf of a reception of illegals. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=311.56s)]
*  He'll yell about it, but there's a political play here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=320.08s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason the White House isn't changing their strategy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=323.56s)]
*  Every single thing you are seeing is deliberate and purposeful. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  From the day Biden came in, he terminated every Trump removal and repatriation policy and replaced it with a mass release machine, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=332.4s)]
*  a mass resettlement operation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=341.32s)]
*  And all Democrats have ever asked for are two things. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=343.32s)]
*  They want amnesty and citizenship for illegals, and they want more money to place them in shelters around the country, more taxpayer dollars. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=346.36s)]
*  They don't want the problem solved. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=355.24s)]
*  They want the problem accommodated and accelerated. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=356.92s)]
*  And this has a very direct connection to the topic in your first segment about President Trump being removed from the ballot, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=360.08s)]
*  because in both cases, what you have is a war on American democracy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=366.0s)]
*  American voters are given no control over their borders, who can enter the country. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=371.24s)]
*  And now they're being deprived of the right to choose their next president. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=375.44s)]
*  There is a war on democracy in this country and it is being waged by the party of Joe Biden. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=379.36s)]
*  Yeah, they're autocrats. They don't care about average people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=387.68s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Last word, Congress. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=390.6s)]
*  Let me just add to that. We were we were just a year. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=392.68s)]
*  Thank God we got the majority. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=396.0s)]
*  You remember Nancy Pelosi's H.R. 1, her first voting bill was to lower the voting age to 16, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  to flood the country with blast balloting and basically make the country be able to ballot harvest like New York and California does. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's it's not just the immigration. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=415.72s)]
*  It's not just both secretary of state and DA is going after President Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=418.04s)]
*  It's also the Democrats in Washington trying to fundamentally change how we vote. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=424.0s)]
*  This is a full fledged across the board assault. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  Stephen's absolutely right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=431.4s)]
*  And we need to see it for what it is and we need to wake up to it and fight like hell to stop it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  Exactly right. I mean, the Democrats worship one God and it's the God of government and power and control and expanding that power and control. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=439.52s)]
*  And we're seeing it power on every level. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=446.28s)]
*  Congressman Walsh, Stephen Miller, thank you both. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9ehDi8u1s&t=449.47999999999996s)]
