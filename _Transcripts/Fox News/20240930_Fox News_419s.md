# The hurricane devastation is ‘heartbreaking’: Gov. Glenn Youngkin
**Fox News:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I)
*  action. The governor of the great Commonwealth of Virginia, Glenn Young, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=0.0s)]
*  can you swear this governor great to have you back? And I'm sorry for all [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  the devastation in your state as well. How are things looking in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=6.24s)]
*  Commonwealth? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=9.84s)]
*  Sean, the devastation is just shocking. Uh, and it's heartbreaking. I spent both [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=12.88s)]
*  Saturday and Sunday in southwest Virginia in communities that have literally been [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=19.28s)]
*  washed away. People have lost everything. And of course, when you look at the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=24.72s)]
*  devastation in North Carolina and Tennessee and South Carolina, Georgia and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=28.64s)]
*  Florida with 120 plus deaths and we had two tragic deaths in Virginia, it is a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=32.64s)]
*  moment for us to come together and to help one another. Listen, what I saw last [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=40.16s)]
*  Friday in Virginia was the extraordinary demonstration of heroism. Virginia State [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Police flying to Uniquoi County in Tennessee and rescuing patients off the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=51.84s)]
*  roof of a hospital that was being flooded. Virginia National Guardsmen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=57.76s)]
*  repelling out of Blackhawk helicopters into rushing waters, pulling people out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=62.32s)]
*  of cars. Uh, and when I visited yesterday with electricity out for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=67.84s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Virginians and cell phone coverage, completely [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  disabled, they need food, they need water. People have gone to work and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=78.16s)]
*  Sean, I'll tell you, it is in fact in these moments of absolute crisis that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=82.88s)]
*  the character of a community comes forth. And this is about Virginians helping [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=88.8s)]
*  Virginians, Americans helping Americans. And in a moment where we need to all [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=93.52s)]
*  pull together, I am encouraged by what I have seen in southwest Virginia where [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=98.96s)]
*  people coming together, what we've seen with folks sending resources to North [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=103.84s)]
*  Carolina for search and rescue missions. There's still hundreds of people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=108.08s)]
*  unaccounted for. We've seen what President Trump was doing in Georgia [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=112.08s)]
*  today across the whole southeast. We're watching people come together in a real [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=115.84s)]
*  moment of tragedy. I'm trying to understand this and this really isn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=120.24s)]
*  political for me. I think it's just basic common sense 101. I had spoken with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=126.8s)]
*  with Governor DeSantis and Governor Kemp. They had pre-positioned all of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=132.64s)]
*  these electrical trucks to get power up and running in their respective states. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=138.48s)]
*  Everybody knew it was going to be a cat three, maybe a cat four hurricane. They [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=142.64s)]
*  knew it was a big storm. They were prepared. They were ready and they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=145.76s)]
*  mobilized immediately and they're still helping people. Nobody really [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=149.44s)]
*  anticipated that North Carolina would get whacked as hard as it did. Our prayers [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=154.56s)]
*  are with them. You know, one of the things that Donald Trump did today is not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=158.72s)]
*  only was he with Samaritan's Purse and Franklin Graham, who I have great [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=162.48s)]
*  admiration for. By the way, I urge people to donate to Samaritan's Purse. I'm [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=165.68s)]
*  going to send a donation myself because people are in real need. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=170.08s)]
*  But he also got on the phone with Elon Musk and he's trying to get [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=175.52s)]
*  Starlink. We have people in pretty large portions of Asheville and other parts of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=180.08s)]
*  North Carolina where they have no communications at all, Governor. We [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  don't know if people's lives are in danger. They're not able to get to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=190.08s)]
*  anybody to help them. You know, why isn't the administration, how did Joe sit on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=194.08s)]
*  the beach all weekend and why was Kamala out, you know, with her Hollywood friends [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  all weekend? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=201.68s)]
*  Yeah, so the innovation that comes to bear when there's a moment of crisis is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  critical and it is exactly as you said, moments like this that we have to try [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=210.4s)]
*  new things. Listen, in Southwest Virginia this week, we literally saw an entire [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  community that was lost and so we've had to bring in all kinds of makeshift [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=222.24s)]
*  routes in order to get them communication, in order to get them temporary [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=228.88s)]
*  electricity, in order to provide shelter, food, a warm shower. This has been a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  moment where we've got to stretch and do things that we hadn't thought we could [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=240.56s)]
*  do. And listen, I think the Starlink idea is brilliant and we got to get moving [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=244.24s)]
*  here. We have been coordinating across all fronts. I have to say, prepositioning [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=249.68s)]
*  all of the resources ahead of the storm was critical and we were able to do the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  exact same thing. We have been, Sean, I have to say, working well with FEMA. They, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=261.36s)]
*  in fact, were moving very quickly over the last few days for us and getting these [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=266.64s)]
*  resources has been critically important. I'm going to go back. You just said, you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  were just talking about Samaritan's Purse and we're working with United Way and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=275.36s)]
*  Southwest Virginia. The nonprofit communities have really moved quickly, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=279.2s)]
*  feeding people, clothing people, showing up with medicine, really important oxygen [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=285.12s)]
*  tanks for older folks who need the oxygen tanks. This has been an all hands on deck [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  moment and we need it all. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we really do. Is there, what do you think people can do that can help you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  around the country? We have one, you know, I find the American people to be the most [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=305.68s)]
*  generous, especially in times of need. What do you recommend? What can people in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=309.6s)]
*  other states be doing to help? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=314.56s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, we've had offers of resources from governors all over. Sarah [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  Huckabee Sanders called me today and said, Governor, what do you need? And so, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=323.68s)]
*  first and foremost, that expression of willingness to send whatever is needed is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  America at its best. And then the ability for Americans to donate is really [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=334.0s)]
*  important. As I said, the United Way in Southwest Virginia is the top deployer [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=338.88s)]
*  we've got on the ground, although churches and religious organizations are moving [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=345.68s)]
*  quickly. I think you're exactly right. Samaritan's Purse is doing amazing work [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  across the entire region. We actually have a group called God's Pit Crew in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=355.36s)]
*  Virginia that has gone to work to support things. And so I just ask folks if [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=360.88s)]
*  you can donate, please do. I appreciate all of the offers of support from, you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=365.28s)]
*  know, governors around the country and Governor Huckabee Sanders. Thank you for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=370.08s)]
*  your offer today. We're not going to put a moment's rest at night until we know [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=374.24s)]
*  that we have got everybody in a safe place. Sean, this is going to be a long [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=382.48s)]
*  recovery. That's the other reality. When you have people who have been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=386.32s)]
*  devastated the way that they have, this is going to be a long recovery period. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=390.24s)]
*  And therefore, this help is not just a 24, 48-hour surge. We're going to need to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=394.56s)]
*  do it for a long period of time. All right, Governor, praying for the people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=399.44s)]
*  in your state and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Thank you for being with us. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqC47Mmmb6I&t=404.24s)]
