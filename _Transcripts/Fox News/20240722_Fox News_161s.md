# Bret Baier: Kamala Harris will be the only nominee who has never won a national primary or caucus
**Fox News:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w)
*  Brett Baer is with us. Brett, I find the voices of Obama, Pelosi, Schumer, Hakeem, Jeffrey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=0.0s)]
*  somewhat deafening tonight. Your thoughts? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=7.04s)]
*  Noticeably absent and not endorsing Vice President Harris right away. She does have a number [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=11.08s)]
*  of key endorsers. Some of the names that are being circulated as possible VPs for her, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=17.04s)]
*  Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Governor Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, Senator Mark [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=23.04s)]
*  Kelly in Arizona all have endorsed her full throated. But you're right to say that those names have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=27.7s)]
*  not. I think it's fascinating that we didn't see President Biden today, that it was only this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=33.02s)]
*  paper statement. You know, LBJ back in 1968 gave a long televised speech about why he was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=38.46s)]
*  stepping down. The only inclination is that he couldn't win to Peter's point. And we have a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=46.42s)]
*  statement that was read by CBS News from Frank Biden, the president's brother, saying that his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=51.82s)]
*  deteriorating health was a quote key factor in this decision. So that's another piece of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=57.74s)]
*  puzzle. Well, the president had claimed up until last week that he did not have any serious health [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=63.5s)]
*  issues or indicate, but did indicate that if he did, he would reconsider. I doubt they're including [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=70.1s)]
*  COVID as a key health issue, right? From every indication, he's recovering nicely from COVID, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=75.94s)]
*  correct? Exactly. I mean, we don't have any indication that he's going south from that, but [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=81.18s)]
*  that he's coughing and has a hoarse voice. But for his brother to say something like that indicates [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  there's something bigger afoot here. And it's likely what we all have seen from the debate, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=93.34s)]
*  which, by the way, is hard to believe that was only three and a half weeks ago. And all that has [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=98.42000000000002s)]
*  transpired in the political news front since then is like the speed of light. One last thing about [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=102.54s)]
*  Vice President Harris, she will be the only nominee, if it is her, who has never won a national [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=109.26s)]
*  primary or caucus. To your point, in 2019, she was out before the Iowa caucuses. The money dried up [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=116.9s)]
*  and the support was not there. So she will have never won a actual vote if she becomes the nominee [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  at the Chicago convention. Yeah, it's going to be phenomenal. There's only 57 days now until early [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=129.9s)]
*  voting begins in Pennsylvania, then rolls out around the rest of the country. Brett, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=138.86s)]
*  pretty unprecedented times we're living in for sure. Brett Baer, thank you. We appreciate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnzL84mU75w&t=143.74s)]
