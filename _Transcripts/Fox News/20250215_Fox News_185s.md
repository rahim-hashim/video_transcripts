# Elon Musk is showing us 'actual fraud': Marjorie Taylor Greene
**Fox News:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8)
*  Doge, committee chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, congresswoman Greene joins us now with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=0.0s)]
*  more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  I'm actually very appreciative to Elon Musk, the smartest guy in the world, one of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  richest guys in the world that's volunteering to do this for our country and exposing their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=12.64s)]
*  reckless spending and abuse of taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=18.72s)]
*  I'm grateful for it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=22.0s)]
*  I completely agree with you, Sean. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=25.54s)]
*  Elon Musk is giving our entire country an inside look at the actual fraud, waste, abuse [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=27.5s)]
*  that's been going on for decades. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=34.42s)]
*  And Americans are cheering and cheering and cheering. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=36.34s)]
*  You know, everyone did vote for this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=39.34s)]
*  This is exactly what we voted for. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=41.18s)]
*  This is what we campaigned for, and this is what President Trump promised to the American [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=43.56s)]
*  people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=47.74s)]
*  And, you know, today in our Doge committee hearing, we were talking about $2.7 trillion [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=48.74s)]
*  that have been basically stolen from the American people through improper payments. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=55.98s)]
*  This is money that's gone to dead people, criminals, basically criminal gangs in foreign [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  countries through personal identity theft. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=66.3s)]
*  And Democrats acted like that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=69.34s)]
*  They acted like complete clowns. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=71.64s)]
*  So you know, I think the Democrat Party just hasn't figured out who they are, but they've [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=74.46s)]
*  decided to fight against the very issue that most Americans really care about, and that's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=78.14s)]
*  $36 trillion in debt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=82.78s)]
*  We're talking about now tens and tens of billions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  It'll be hundreds and hundreds of billions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=89.86s)]
*  And I would not be surprised if we get to a trillion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=92.38s)]
*  How high do you see this waste, fraud, abuse and corruption going? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=95.02s)]
*  Oh, it's unreal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=99.1s)]
*  The more and more Elon Musk and his incredibly talented and intelligent Doge team dig into [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  the payment systems within the departments of the government, they're just finding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=109.66s)]
*  out more and more information. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=113.84s)]
*  One of the things I just learned this week from Elon is that there has been Social Security [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  checks paid out to recipients that don't even have Social Security ID numbers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  And this is something that they're really starting to investigate. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=127.56s)]
*  And it actually should be terrifying to every single American, no matter how you vote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=130.44s)]
*  But on our Doge committee, we are setting up in complete alignment with Doge because [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=135.44s)]
*  It's not just executive orders and executive action that will save the country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Congress has to engage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=146.8s)]
*  And so we have to line up with them through a legislature standpoint and help achieve [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=148.0s)]
*  this very important goal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=155.44s)]
*  And it's got to be codified into law. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=156.44s)]
*  And he is he's basically building a map so that we can find all the waste, fraud and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  abuse, stop stealing from our kids and grandkids, and hopefully even eventually get our budget [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=165.32s)]
*  in balance. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=171.08s)]
*  Congresswoman, great to see you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=172.08s)]
*  Great job, by the way, today. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbSeHIxWb8&t=174.24s)]
