# Newt Gingrich: Trump will get a higher vote share than any Republican since Eisenhower
**Fox News:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo)
*  Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  This poll is pretty staggering, and this is one of many polls. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=2.56s)]
*  This is now poll after poll, very consistently. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  We'll look at African-American voters first. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=9.36s)]
*  But careening towards a historic performance among black voters, the likes of which we've [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=12.76s)]
*  not seen in six decades, at this time in 2020, Donald Trump had 7 percent of the African-American [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=17.72s)]
*  vote. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=25.36s)]
*  Now he's up to 21 percent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=26.36s)]
*  Now here's the worst part for Biden, is that if you look at his advantage, Biden's advantage [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=27.4s)]
*  over Trump among black voters under 50, that's great, except he's down 43 points from his [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=33.44s)]
*  80-point lead among the same demographic at this point in the 2020 campaign. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=39.4s)]
*  Now I don't think every poll could be that off, do you? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=46.84s)]
*  Because this is dramatic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=51.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I think we shouldn't assume that black Americans are dumb or insensitive [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=52.64s)]
*  or incapable of learning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=64.0s)]
*  They're looking at grocery store prices they can't afford, and they know it's Biden's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=66.68s)]
*  fault. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=70.88s)]
*  They're looking at millions of illegal immigrants coming into their neighborhoods, taking their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=71.88s)]
*  jobs, threatening their families with violence, and they know Biden is responsible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=77.16s)]
*  You turn around and they know the schools aren't working, despite all the money we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=84.28s)]
*  pour into the teachers' unions, and they know the Democrats are responsible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=87.86s)]
*  They look at big cities where Democrat after mayor, Democrat mayor after Democrat mayor [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=92.46s)]
*  is corrupt and competent and incapable of serving their interests. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=97.24s)]
*  So what you're beginning to see is a movement that says, you know, what have we got to lose [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=103.64s)]
*  by trying out Donald Trump? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=109.64s)]
*  I think he will get a higher vote than any Republican since Eisenhower and may in fact [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=111.92s)]
*  exceed Eisenhower, because the momentum for the next four months, I think, is all going [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=118.14s)]
*  to be in Trump's favor as people talk to each other. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=122.38s)]
*  You'll notice, while Trump is at 21 and people are saying, boy, that's good, Biden has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=127.2s)]
*  collapsed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=132.32s)]
*  The number of black Democrats and, for that matter, Latino Democrats, who are now undecided [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  and potentially could switch to Trump, are breathtaking. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's why you're beginning to see places like Minneapolis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=144.44s)]
*  You know, I mean, Minnesota, the last poll, Trump's up four. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=147.32s)]
*  Well, if he carries Minnesota by any margin, he's on the verge of a 1980 Ronald Reagan [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=151.68s)]
*  blowout of Jimmy Carter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=159.24s)]
*  And I don't see practically how the Democrats offset reality. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=161.12s)]
*  Let me ask you, but it's not just African Americans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=167.84s)]
*  It's Hispanic Americans. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=170.84s)]
*  It is, it's young people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=172.24s)]
*  I mean, our old mutual friend, James Carville, who I like, he's crazy, but I like him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=174.24s)]
*  You've debated him, I'm sure, over the years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=180.52s)]
*  I've debated him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=182.08s)]
*  Fun guy to hang out with, but he's crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=183.08s)]
*  But he's not as crazy as the modern, you know, radicalized Democratic Party, and he's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=186.12s)]
*  trying to bring some sanity back to them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  They'd be smart to listen to them, but they're not going to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=193.88s)]
*  When you look at all of those demographics combined, it seems like this election, if [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=197.88s)]
*  it comes down to Biden's open borders, if it comes down to the economy's stupid, if [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=202.76s)]
*  it comes down to simple law and order versus defund, dismantle, no bail laws, if it comes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=208.88s)]
*  down to America abdicating its role on the world stage as the leader of liberty and freedom [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=215.0s)]
*  and surrendering in the war on terror, like in the case of Hamas, I don't see how this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=220.0s)]
*  election could even be close. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, but I guess it will be. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=227.24s)]
*  I don't know that'll be close. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=232.2s)]
*  I mean, first of all, as I've pointed out on your radio show earlier, when the debate's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=234.08s)]
*  done next week, whether Biden does well or Biden does badly, the following day, people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  go to the grocery store and his support collapses again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=245.72s)]
*  I don't care how many million dollars Biden raises, his advertising can't overcome the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=249.88s)]
*  reality of going to the gas station, not being able to afford to buy a house, not being able [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  to find a good job, learning that immigrants now are getting more jobs than Americans. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=260.96s)]
*  And all these things fit in and people talk to each other way beyond television and way [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=269.76s)]
*  beyond social media. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  And the conversation's almost all bad for Joe Biden. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=276.52s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=280.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=281.36s)]
*  Do you expect jacked up Joe or regular mumbling, mumbling, fumbling Joe at the debate? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=282.36s)]
*  I expect no. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=286.92s)]
*  He will be aggressive. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=289.96s)]
*  He'll be jacked up and he'll go like crazy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=290.96s)]
*  And I just hope that Trump can stay very calm, very Reagan-like, let Biden be a fool and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=294.78s)]
*  just endure it and not counterattack. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=301.38s)]
*  I will tell you, it's very simple. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=304.61999999999995s)]
*  They're going to go in with one strategy, to piss off Donald Trump. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't have to take the bait for sure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=310.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tm67vmO1Zo&t=312.9s)]
