# Harvard alum Ted Cruz: This is a flat-out lie
**Fox News:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM)
*  Harvard Law School alumni, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=4.0s)]
*  I had debating on this program two professors from Harvard. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=5.88s)]
*  One, a Democrat that thinks you were one of his best students of all time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=9.16s)]
*  That would be Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=13.0s)]
*  The other, Cornel West, who's running for president. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  And I said at the end of that debate, Senator, that the sad part is, this debate that we [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=17.92s)]
*  had on this show, we would not be able to have at Harvard. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=23.44s)]
*  We reached out to them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=27.76s)]
*  They never got back to us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=29.28s)]
*  And I think that speaks volumes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=31.48s)]
*  What is your reaction to your alma mater? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=32.92s)]
*  Look, it is disgraceful how Harvard is behaving. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=35.24s)]
*  I got to say, Claudine Gay's testimony was the worst testimony I've seen in the 11 years [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=38.84s)]
*  I've been in the Senate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=44.28s)]
*  You had her testimony. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  You had the president of Penn. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  You had the president of MIT. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  The president of Penn has already resigned in disgrace. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  I think all three should resign in disgrace. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Not a one of them could give a simple, clear answer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=54.52s)]
*  Not a one of them could categorically denounce anti-Semitism, categorically denounce genocide [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=57.56s)]
*  against the Jewish people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=63.64s)]
*  And not a one of them could figure out whether calling for mass murder of Jews violates their [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  harassment policy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=71.08s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=72.4s)]
*  And there's a reason. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=73.94s)]
*  Why did Claudine, like listen to all of these people defending Claudine Gay's. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=75.28s)]
*  Well, she was surprised. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=79.68s)]
*  What do you mean she was surprised? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=81.0s)]
*  The entire topic of her testimony was on this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=82.4s)]
*  And the reason she gave that answer is that she sides with the protesters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  She is a radical leftist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=91.42s)]
*  She is a cultural Marxist. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=93.14s)]
*  You talk about my book, Unwoke, How to Defeat Cultural Marxism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=94.52s)]
*  This is cultural Marxism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=98.6s)]
*  They define Jews as oppressors. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=100.8s)]
*  They define Palestinians as victims. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=104.44s)]
*  And the cultural Marxists support the violent revolution of the victims against the so-called [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=107.6s)]
*  oppressors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=113.76s)]
*  And the result is because the three of them are leftists, they are cheering for the Hamas [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=114.92s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=120.08s)]
*  It is disgraceful. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=121.08s)]
*  And I got to say at Harvard, you are seeing Jewish students being harassed, being threatened [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=122.4s)]
*  at MIT. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=126.84s)]
*  You're seeing Jewish students afraid to go to class. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=128.04s)]
*  And these leftists are unwilling to stand up and defend their students. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=131.0s)]
*  She should resign. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=135.8s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I think there are thousands upon thousands of Harvard alums who are horrified [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=137.3s)]
*  at the behavior of the institution right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=142.9s)]
*  You know, we often talk, Senator, about identity politics. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  What if the genocide of—and then fill in the blank—had to do with a particular race [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  or a particular sex or against anyone in the LGBTQ community? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Or what if genocide of a person with gender identity issues? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=159.4s)]
*  Or what if it was genocide against people that believe in Islam? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=166.08s)]
*  I think there'd be a very different reaction on campus. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=170.58s)]
*  Look, the students would be expelled immediately. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=175.16s)]
*  If you called for genocide of any of those groups whom the left defines as victims, you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=176.92s)]
*  would be expelled immediately. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  But because they view Jews in the context of Israel as oppressors, you're allowed to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=184.2s)]
*  abuse them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, USC banned a Jewish professor from coming on campus. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  It was an economics professor who anti-Semitic protesters threatened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=194.76s)]
*  And USC ordered him to teach his entire class remotely for the year. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=198.76s)]
*  You know, my podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz, yesterday's podcast is entirely on this Harvard [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=204.4s)]
*  testimony and just how disgraceful it is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=208.78s)]
*  And for the Harvard corporation to say, we stand entirely with our president—you know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=212.5s)]
*  what it's saying? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=218.66s)]
*  It's saying, we're okay with anti-Semitism. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=219.66s)]
*  We don't want Jewish students to feel safe on our campus. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=222.06s)]
*  And by the way, Claudia Nge in that same testimony, she was asked about the percentage of Jewish [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=224.66s)]
*  students that has plummeted on Harvard's campus. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=230.32s)]
*  And she said, I don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how many Jewish students are there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  Which is a flat out lie. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=237.22s)]
*  These bean counters, they know every transgendered, left-handed, whatever. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=238.7s)]
*  They know that, but yet they claim they don't know how many Jewish people are on campus. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=245.98s)]
*  This is an institution. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=251.66s)]
*  And by the way, Harvard, going back to the 1950s, Harvard had in place what were called [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=252.66s)]
*  the Jewish quotas, where they capped the number of Jewish students allowed in because on merit [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  Jews were doing really well and getting good scores and getting good grades. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=263.86s)]
*  And they said, Harvard said, we don't want too many Jews. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=267.54s)]
*  And they put quotas in place. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=270.42s)]
*  And so for her to claim now, she doesn't know how many Jews are there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=271.82s)]
*  And she's apparently not troubled that Jews feel threatened because she's willing to contribute [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  to the rhetoric that is undermining the safety of her own students. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=281.44s)]
*  And by the way, to be clear, I don't mean safety from comments that are difficult to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=284.78s)]
*  hear. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=289.18s)]
*  I mean safety from physical threats. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=290.18s)]
*  We've seen videos of Jewish students at Harvard being harassed, being threatened physically. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=292.94s)]
*  And I got to tell you, if any student physically threatens another student, that student should [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=298.74s)]
*  be expelled, whether they're Jewish or Muslim or what have you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=303.94s)]
*  Universities should protect their students. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=307.74s)]
*  These leftists won't do that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=309.3s)]
*  Unrelated topic. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=311.02s)]
*  You really want to have to, Senator Dick Durbin, for protecting those people flying on Jeffrey [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=312.64s)]
*  Epstein's plane, the Lolita Express, as it's called, for not wanting to subpoena the flight [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=318.26s)]
*  logs that would give everybody the names. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=324.9s)]
*  Why is he unwilling to get those flight logs? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Look, it's an awfully good question. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=329.3s)]
*  He, a Fox News reporter, asked him in the hall of the Senate why Dick Durbin and the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=331.46s)]
*  Senate Democrats were blocking the flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein's planes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=336.26s)]
*  And he claimed, I don't know anything about it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=342.62s)]
*  I don't know about it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=343.62s)]
*  On my podcast yesterday, I played the video and said, yes, you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=344.62s)]
*  were there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=348.18s)]
*  You're the one. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=349.18s)]
*  It was my colleague, Marcia Blackburn. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=350.18s)]
*  She introduced an amendment that I joined that would have subpoenaed the flight logs [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=351.82s)]
*  and said, we need to see who was on that plane. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  If there are prominent politicians who were involved in molesting young girls, we need [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=358.82s)]
*  to know, don't protect them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  And I got to say, the Democrats are freaking out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=366.72s)]
*  He literally blocked all amendments. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=368.98s)]
*  And in my view, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, we ought to keep pushing to say, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=371.94s)]
*  we're going to vote on the record. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=375.88s)]
*  If you are covering up for someone who is engaged in molesting children, we're going [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=377.1s)]
*  to expose it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=382.82s)]
*  And I will say, Sean, do you know what painting Jeffrey Epstein had hanging in his living [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=384.24s)]
*  room in Manhattan? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=389.54s)]
*  I don't. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=391.38s)]
*  He had, it's really horrible. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=393.06s)]
*  He had a painting of Bill Clinton in a blue dress wearing red pumps, high heels hanging [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=394.98s)]
*  on his wall. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=401.9s)]
*  It's traumatizing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=402.9s)]
*  If you Google it, you're going to hate the image. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=403.9s)]
*  That's what Epstein had on his wall. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdyOaBOfWpM&t=406.18s)]
