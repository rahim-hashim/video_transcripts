# Biden is getting outperformed by everyone: Hannity
**Fox News:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M)
*  Welcome to Hannity, an alarming new report from the House Judiciary Committee in 2021. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=0.0s)]
*  Believe it or not, your federal government began asking banks to sift through private [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=6.0s)]
*  transactions from millions of Americans and search for terms like Trump and MAGA, which—so, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=10.96s)]
*  which banks voluntarily handed over that information? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=19.52s)]
*  And what did the DOJ do with it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jim Jordan, will join us with more on this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Orwellian and frankly dangerous breach of personal privacy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Now, needless to say, the 2024 election cannot happen soon enough. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, thankfully, we are just six days away from the New Hampshire primary. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=38.96s)]
*  Now, one important note, unlike many other primaries, the Granite State allows [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=43.36s)]
*  independents and Democrats who register as independents to participate in the Republican [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=48.08s)]
*  race. Over 4,000 Democrats, by the way, they're now independent. They're going to want to vote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=54.32s)]
*  It looks like those votes are being directed towards former Ambassador Nikki Haley. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=60.72s)]
*  She's performing well among those two groups. Expectations are high. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=66.0s)]
*  But as of tonight, Donald Trump maintains a large lead in the state of New Hampshire. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=70.24s)]
*  According to the latest Boston Globe-Suffolk University poll, Trump is up by 16. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=74.64s)]
*  The Anselm University poll just came out. Trump up by 13. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=80.72s)]
*  Now, all of the Republican candidates, including Trump, they're outperforming Biden in the general [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=84.8s)]
*  election, especially true in the key battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=90.4s)]
*  Now, tonight, a rare moment of clarity from the vice president. That's Vice President Harris. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=96.56s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=101.44s)]
*  Are you scared, first of all, what could happen if Trump ever became, God forbid, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=103.36s)]
*  president again? And what are you going to do to stop the crazies? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=107.68s)]
*  I am scared as heck. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=113.28s)]
*  Which is why I'm traveling our country. You know, there's an old saying that there are only two ways [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=117.28s)]
*  to run for office, either without an opponent or scared. So on all of those points, yes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  we should all be scared. But as we know, and certainly this is a table of very powerful [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=128.16s)]
*  women, we don't run away from something when we're scared. We fight back against it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=135.68s)]
*  Maybe you should be scared about the unvetted 10 million illegal immigrants that your administration [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=142.32s)]
*  is allowing into the country. Maybe you should be scared about war in Europe and threats against [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=148.32s)]
*  NATO allies. Maybe you should be scared about war in the Middle East as you pressure Israel to give [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=154.16s)]
*  up their fight against radical terrorists that took place there. Now, she is right, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=160.88s)]
*  they should be running scared. The Biden-Harris ticket now has two colossal hurdles to overcome. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  First, Joe Biden. Well, we all know it's very obvious. It's very clear. He's just not mentally [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=174.24s)]
*  competent. And every day America's oldest president keeps getting worse right before our eyes. He [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=180.32s)]
*  needs help walking. He needs help talking. The first lady reportedly not only helping him out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=186.64s)]
*  stage left or stage right, but also helping him with his daily schedule. He gets up late, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  goes to bed early, takes more vacations than any president in the modern era. We barely see him [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=197.92s)]
*  in public, holds almost no political rallies, rarely conducts press conferences or shows up [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=202.88s)]
*  for a serious interview. He does go to Delaware an awful lot, spends more time on vacation than any [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  other president, as I said in the modern era. Naturally, most people seem to view Biden as [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=215.68s)]
*  president in name only. And this brings us to the second hurdle to reelection. Whoever is running [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=221.84s)]
*  the show at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they're doing a terrible job. Are you better off than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=227.52s)]
*  you were four years ago? Their decision making is historically bad. Their policies result in one [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=234.24s)]
*  crisis after another. The American people, you can all see personally and feel this rolling [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=240.16s)]
*  disaster every single day. Every time you fill up at your gas station, every time you buy groceries, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  every time you go out to eat, every time you order Grubhub, you feel the impact of Biden inflation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=253.28s)]
*  Every time you look for a new house, a new car, or pay rent or open a credit card bill, you know [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=259.36s)]
*  the burden of Bidenomics. And every single time you see illegal immigrants pouring into our country [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=265.36s)]
*  unvetted, enjoying taxpayer-funded housing, transportation, education and healthcare, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=271.12s)]
*  you should feel betrayed because they're not enforcing the laws. He's not upholding his oath [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  for our constitution. And now a new palpable fear, World War III, as violence and carnage [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=282.8s)]
*  overseas, it gets worse and worse and worse. And you don't have to be a MAGA superfan to realize [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=290.08s)]
*  America is simply not better off under Biden. There's not a single thing I can point to that is, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=296.8s)]
*  oh, they implemented a policy that's successful. I can't think of one. The chairman, the CEO of JP [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=303.36s)]
*  Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, definitely not a conservative. He previously donated to Democrats, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=310.32s)]
*  was closely linked to former Obama insiders, but now even Jamie Dimon has a stark warning [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=316.56s)]
*  for the Biden campaign. Take a look at this. Now, if you look, just take a step back, be honest. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=322.88s)]
*  He's kind of right about NATO, kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=327.76s)]
*  China virus. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China. I don't like what he did. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I said China virus. I understand. He made them right. And I don't like how he said things in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  Mexico. I don't like, but he wasn't wrong about some of these critical issues. And that's why [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=342.64s)]
*  the vote for him. The Democrats have done a pretty good job with the deplorables, hugging onto their [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  bibles and their beer and their guns. I mean, really, could we just stop that stuff and actually [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=352.4s)]
*  grow up and treat other people with respect and listen to them a little bit? And I do think the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=357.44s)]
*  economy will affect. I think this negative talk about MAGA is going to hurt Biden's election [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=361.92s)]
*  campaign. Democracy in peril, January 6th, Trump is evil. By the way, President Trump was right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=367.6s)]
*  Notice that Diamond made those remarks on CNBC. He didn't even get pushback. Now it is increasingly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=374.72s)]
*  difficult for the media mob to do the heavy lifting for Joe Biden, but make no mistake, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=381.12s)]
*  they will try their best. And according to a recent study, look at this from Syracuse, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  only 3.4% of quote journalists, most of them are not journalists, claim to be Republicans. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=390.88s)]
*  The other 96% are likely either rooting against Trump or actively working in conjunction with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  the Democratic Party. They are, they're in, are an extension of the press office of the DNC and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  Joe Biden. They just don't hate Donald Trump. They also despise any American that supports him [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=411.76s)]
*  and everyone that doesn't buy into their twisted worldview. And right on cue, you got both fake news, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=418.96s)]
*  CNN, MSDNC refusing to take, God forbid we hear from the historic winner of Iowa and here is speech [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  in full. Senator Marco Rubio responded on X saying quote, U.S. media refusing to carry Trump's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=433.12s)]
*  speech live last night after a historic Iowa victory is exactly how undemocratic regimes abroad [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=440.24s)]
*  use state-run media to try to delegitimize, dismiss, discredit their political opposition. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=448.48s)]
*  Democrats, the mob and the media no longer care about facts. They don't care about logic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=454.8s)]
*  The only thing they seem to care about, you know, is narrative and power. And as George Orwell [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=459.68s)]
*  famously wrote quote, whatever the party holds to be the truth is the truth. You know, it is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=466.48s)]
*  impossible to see reality except looking through the eyes of the party. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVBRxkx89M&t=474.32s)]
