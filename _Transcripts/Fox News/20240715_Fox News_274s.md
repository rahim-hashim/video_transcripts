# Eye witness reporter recalls the Trump assassination attempt
**Fox News:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI)
*  Jackson, Selena Zito, join us right now with more. Selena, I'll start with you. Four feet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=0.0s)]
*  away. Let's talk about what you saw, what happened. Walk us through it. That had to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=6.84s)]
*  be harrowing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=13.68s)]
*  It was. I'm not quite sure if the impact has hit me just yet. I want to backtrack a little [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=14.8s)]
*  bit and tell you just before the president went out to speak last night, he or yeah, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=24.04s)]
*  last night, he I met with him just briefly. He was in a back holding room meeting mostly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=31.04s)]
*  with local law enforcement, getting their picture taken with him, shaking their hands. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=36.78s)]
*  And I went back. I was supposed to go and interview him after the event and fly to Bedminster [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=42.8s)]
*  to do that. And he was just he was in great spirits. He talked about how excited he was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  to be in Pennsylvania and how much Pennsylvania meant. Within six minutes, I was standing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  in the bumper. That's the well that is outside the perimeter of where the president is on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  the stage, but before the audience with the other photojournalist. And he came out. He [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=67.6s)]
*  was waving. I moved to what would have been his left and was standing right there. And [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=73.12s)]
*  he, you know, if you've ever been to a Trump rally, he never looks to his side. He always [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=80.12s)]
*  looks forward. He always looks forward. And he put a chart up behind him and he turned. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=87.12s)]
*  And just as he turned, I heard pop, pop, pop. And you saw the red on his face. And he was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  and he goes down. He doesn't fall down. He kneels down. And I was standing right there, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=103.92s)]
*  heard pop, pop, pop again at about the same time when you saw the Secret Service and other [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=109.44s)]
*  law enforcement surround him and bring him down and and and you know, sort of a protective [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=114.72s)]
*  shield. And and I was at that point laying there with with one of his advance men sitting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=121.16s)]
*  laying on top of me with my daughter beside me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. How many shots do you believe based on your very close proximity [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=130.98s)]
*  were fired in the direction of the president? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=136.7s)]
*  I heard at least six shots. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=142.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  I heard at least six. It could have been seven. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  Not just six. I mean, did you hear, for example, did you hear them like landing right there [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=148.62s)]
*  by the podium? Did you know that they were? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  Right, right, right past me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Right past you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=159.64s)]
*  They went right past me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  That's chilling. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Hold on, Selena. Dr. Jackson, good to see you. Your nephew. First [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  of all, is he OK? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=169.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing fine, Sean. He didn't have a serious injury. He's doing fine. I mean, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=170.6s)]
*  I think the biggest thing for him was that they took him to the medical tent. The the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=173.6s)]
*  gentleman that that passed away was in the tent there. And I think that was probably [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  more more of a trauma to him than anything. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. What did he tell you happened? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, he said, you know, they were there and they heard the shots and they just realized [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  once they realized they were shots, everybody kind of dropped to the ground and they realized [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=188.4s)]
*  that he had some blood on his neck and then they saw his neck and some of the other guests [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=191.4s)]
*  that were there said, hey, you're bleeding. And so they took him back to the tent. And [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=195.16s)]
*  I guess you have a medical relationship with with President Trump and a friendship with [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=199.16s)]
*  President Trump. What do you know about the extent of his injuries? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=203.8s)]
*  Well, you know, I went to the Bedminster last night and I've been with the president all [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  day and I flew in here with him just while ago. And, you know, he's just an incredible [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=210.96s)]
*  spirit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=214.96s)]
*  I've not seen a picture of him since. I assume he's got to have something over his ear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=216.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a bandage on his ear. It's a bulky bandage on his ear because, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=219.72s)]
*  the ear bleeds very aggressively, you know, and it was more it wasn't like a laceration [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  you would get with a knife. The bullet like, you know, it was a piercing, he called it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=228.24s)]
*  Yeah, it took it took a little bit off the top of his ear. And so that's real friable. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=231.56s)]
*  And if you if you mess with it at all, it starts bleeding again. So he'll have a dressing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=235.68s)]
*  on his ear for a couple of days, I'm sure, you know, to control that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Is it something that may not may need to be fixed down the road? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. I think it'll fill in and heal in, you know, I think it'll be OK. We'll [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=246.28s)]
*  see what it looks like when it's pretty frightening. And I'm sure, you know, and our prayers do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=249.88s)]
*  go out to the families, all those those families that lost loved ones. We can't forget about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  them either. Dr. Jackson, Congressman, good to see you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAd_OuUK7VI&t=258.64s)]
