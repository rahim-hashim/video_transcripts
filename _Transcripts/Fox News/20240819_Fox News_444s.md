# AOC delivers impassioned speech to DNC: ‘KAMALA IS FOR YOU’
**Fox News:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU)
*  All right, AOC is taken to the stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're not going to go with the whole speech, but we will dip in. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=2.24s)]
*  Thank you, Chicago, for your energy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=5.92s)]
*  Thank you, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for your vision. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=9.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=24.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=29.04s)]
*  Thank you, Joe Biden for your leadership. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=30.4s)]
*  You know, six years ago, I was taking omelet orders as a waitress in New York City. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=42.16s)]
*  I didn't have health insurance. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=48.88s)]
*  My family was fighting off foreclosure, and we were struggling with bills after my dad passed away unexpectedly from cancer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=51.68s)]
*  Like millions of Americans, we were just as worried about our health. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=63.92s)]
*  Like millions of Americans, we were just looking for an honest shake, and we were tired of a cynical politics that seemed blind to the realities of working people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  It was then, only through the miracles of democracy and community, that the good people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=89.28s)]
*  of the Bronx and Queens chose someone like me to elect them in Congress. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=98.28s)]
*  And America, in my heart, I know from that same cloth of hope and aspiration, we will [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=111.32s)]
*  also elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as President and Vice Presidents of the United States of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=119.44s)]
*  America. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  I am here tonight because America has before us a rare and precious opportunity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  In Kamala Harris, we have a chance to elect a President who is for the middle class because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=139.84s)]
*  she is from the middle class. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  She understands the urgency of rent checks and groceries and prescriptions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=151.4s)]
*  She is as committed to our reproductive and civil rights as she is to taking on corporate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=158.16s)]
*  greed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=164.96s)]
*  And she is working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing postages home. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=169.32s)]
*  In Kamala Harris, I see a leader who understands. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=183.64s)]
*  I see a leader with a real commitment to a better future for working families. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=189.48s)]
*  In Chicago, we have to help her win. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=198.0s)]
*  Because we know that Donald Trump would sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=203.0s)]
*  his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=209.32s)]
*  And I, for one, am tired of hearing about how a two-bit union buster thinks of himself [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=213.32s)]
*  than the woman who fights every single day to rip working people out from under the boots [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=223.6s)]
*  of greed traveling on our way of life. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=232.6s)]
*  The truth is, Don, you cannot love this country if you only fight for the wealthy and big [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=237.6s)]
*  business. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=245.6s)]
*  To love this country is to fight for its people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=247.6s)]
*  All people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=254.6s)]
*  Working people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=256.6s)]
*  Everyday Americans like bartenders and factory workers and fast food cashiers who punch a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=257.6s)]
*  clock and are on their feet all day in some of the toughest jobs out there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=265.6s)]
*  You know, ever since I got elected, Republicans have attacked me by saying that I should go [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=273.6s)]
*  back to bartending. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=285.6s)]
*  But let me tell you, I'm happy to any day of the week because there is nothing wrong [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=287.6s)]
*  with working for a living. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=297.6s)]
*  Imagine having leaders in the White House who understand that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=302.6s)]
*  Leaders like Kamala and Tim. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=313.6s)]
*  But Chicago, just because the choice is clear to us does not mean that the path will be [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=318.6s)]
*  easy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=325.6s)]
*  Over the next 78 days, we will have to pour every ounce, every minute, every moment into [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=326.6s)]
*  making history on November 5th. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=334.6s)]
*  But we cannot send Kamala and Tim to the White House alone. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=340.6s)]
*  Together, we must also elect strong Democratic majorities in the House and in the Senate [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=348.6s)]
*  so that we can deliver on an ambitious agenda for the people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=356.6s)]
*  Because if you are a working parent trying to afford rent and child care, Kamala is for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=364.6s)]
*  you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=371.6s)]
*  If you are a senior who had to go back to work because your retirement didn't stretch [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=372.6s)]
*  far enough, Kamala is for you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=378.6s)]
*  If you're an immigrant family just starting your American story, Kamala is for you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=383.6s)]
*  America, when we knock on our neighbors' door, organize our communities, and elect [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=391.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris to the presidency on November 5th, we will send a loud message that the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=401.6s)]
*  people of this nation will not go back. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=407.6s)]
*  We choose a new path and open the door to a new day, one that is for the people and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=410.6s)]
*  by the people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=417.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=419.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=420.6s)]
*  God bless. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=421.6s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=422.6s)]
*  AOC. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=423.6s)]
*  That's AOC on the stage. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmldRxZaVU&t=424.6s)]
