# Tom Homan on finding missing children: 'It's going to be a tough job'
**Fox News:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04)
*  Tom Homan, incoming border guard, joins us right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=0.0s)]
*  Tom, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=3.08s)]
*  I don't think anybody's on TV more these days, and I don't think it's important [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=5.08s)]
*  for anybody to be on TV as much as you, explaining what you plan on doing day one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=8.28s)]
*  Let's talk specifically about your promise to solve the problem that Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=13.44s)]
*  and Biden-Harris created, which is these missing children. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=19.44s)]
*  Tell us what you can do and will do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=23.12s)]
*  Well, that's going to be the most difficult part of it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=26.08s)]
*  Like, President Trump gave me three priorities, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=29.32s)]
*  He secured the border, run a deportation operation, and find these children, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  the 340,000 missing children. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  It's going to be a tough job because of what this administration has done. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  Whistleblowers from Health and Human Services are saying that many of the sponsors [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  weren't fingerprinted and weren't properly vetted. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  The way we find people, like you and I, we both have a digital footprint, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=49.08s)]
*  We own homes, we drive cars. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  We have driver's license. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  We pay bills. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  We pay utilities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  So there's a footprint out there, digital footprint for you and I. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Children don't have a footprint, which means we got to count on the footprint for the adults, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  or the unvetted sponsors. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=66.48s)]
*  And if they're not properly vetted, if they're not properly fingerprinted, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=68.48s)]
*  then we're starting out in a bad place. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=71.48s)]
*  That's why we're going to bring in a lot of the civil organizations around the country, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=74.48s)]
*  private organizations that have been working this child trafficking issue [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=79.48s)]
*  for the last several years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=82.48s)]
*  We're also going to call on the American people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=83.68s)]
*  We're going to establish 1-800-Number and ask the American people to help us out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=85.68s)]
*  Parents have an innate ability to see something that's not right, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=89.68s)]
*  whether it's a child in a workplace or a child with an adult that just doesn't seem right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=93.68s)]
*  We're going to ask the American people to step up and take notice, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=98.68s)]
*  see something, say something, contact us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=100.68s)]
*  And if one phone call out of a thousand saves a child from sex trafficking or forced labor, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=102.68s)]
*  then that's one life saved. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=109.68s)]
*  So it's going to be a daunting task, but we're going to give it everything we've got. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  You know, Tom, I appreciate you talking about that, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  because in the first term where we worked together, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  what did the left constantly criticize us for? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  That these children and many of their parents are trying to escape injustices [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  in their home countries and come here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And you're telling me that the children who came here [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=129.88s)]
*  may have been brought here by coyotes, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=131.88s)]
*  by folks who, God forbid, harmed them in some way, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=134.88s)]
*  and then we don't even know what's happened to them when they're here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=137.88s)]
*  It's very difficult to justify that somehow they escaped tough circumstances, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  and now we as a nation, the richest, most powerful nation in the world, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  can't find these kids. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Is there something going on beyond the incompetence [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  and the epidemic of just looking the other way [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  from the Biden-Harris-Majorcas administration? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Or do you think there was something more systemic happening here [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  that these kids are just missing? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, we know that over half a million children were trafficked in this country [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  under Joe Biden's and Alejandro Mayorkas' overwatch, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=169.28s)]
*  and we know that many of these children are going to be in sex trafficking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=173.28s)]
*  and labor trafficking. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=176.28s)]
*  This is just not Tom Homer's opinion. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=177.28s)]
*  I mean, done this for three and a half decades. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=179.28s)]
*  ICE has already found many of these children in factories, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=181.28s)]
*  cleaning up entrails in a meatpacking plant in the Midnight Shift. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=184.28s)]
*  We found some living with predators. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=188.28s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=190.28s)]
*  And the biggest shock for them all is the Secretary for HHS, Basera. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=192.28s)]
*  He's on stage bragging about how quick [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=197.48s)]
*  they take these children in custody and release them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=200.48s)]
*  They release them at record pace, he says, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=203.48s)]
*  because one thing that this administration is concerned about, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=205.48s)]
*  the only thing they're concerned about [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=208.48s)]
*  is the optics of this historic illegal migration crisis. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=210.48s)]
*  If there's no overcrowding, then there's nothing to see here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=214.48s)]
*  So that's why they released these children on proper vetting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=217.48s)]
*  They stopped the DNA testing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=219.48s)]
*  They stopped the proper vetting. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=221.48s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, we had DNA testing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=222.48s)]
*  We vetted everybody in the household, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=224.48s)]
*  not just the sponsor, but anybody that lived in the household [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  to make sure there wasn't a gang member, child predator [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  living in that household. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  So this is an incompetence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  This isn't mismanagement. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  This is by design. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  This is about moving as many people in this country as possible [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  because they see a future political benefit in all this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  Do I think they meant to put children's harm away? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  I have my suspicions, but what they did [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  is harming hundreds of thousands of children. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  And I tell you right now, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  some of these children were never going to find. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  Some of these children are dead. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=254.88s)]
*  Some of these children are living a life of hell every day, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=256.88s)]
*  but we're going to do everything we can [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=259.88s)]
*  to rescue as many as we can [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=261.88s)]
*  and get them back to their families. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=263.88s)]
*  We'll deal with the immigration consequences later. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=265.88s)]
*  We've got to get these kids back to their families [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=267.88s)]
*  and we've got to make sure they're protected. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=269.88s)]
*  It's unspeakable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=271.88s)]
*  So you've talked a lot about what you're going to do on day one [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=273.88s)]
*  and week one and month one. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=276.88s)]
*  I'd like you to project forward [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=278.88s)]
*  a similar question that I asked Senator Hagerty [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=280.88s)]
*  from the Senate perspective. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=282.88s)]
*  To Tom Homan, our borders are. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=284.08s)]
*  What would qualify as success to you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=286.08s)]
*  100 days in, one year, two years in? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=289.08s)]
*  What does that look like to you? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=292.08s)]
*  That the border is secure, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=296.08s)]
*  that the process on the border [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=298.08s)]
*  and our historic close that were against Trump, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=300.08s)]
*  and it won't take long. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=302.08s)]
*  We already did it once. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=304.08s)]
*  We just got dust off those plans. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=305.08s)]
*  We don't need Mexico to get into the Remain in Mexico program, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=306.08s)]
*  but President Trump's a strong president. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=308.08s)]
*  He'll get them to agree to it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=310.08s)]
*  We're going to shut down the CBP1 app [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=312.28s)]
*  and the HCHNB program that brings thousands of illegal aliens [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=314.28s)]
*  to our airports in the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=317.28s)]
*  In the CBP1 app, thousands come to a port of entry. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=319.28s)]
*  Same illegal alien population, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=322.28s)]
*  but they created these programs they call legal pathways, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=324.28s)]
*  which aren't legal, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=326.28s)]
*  just to break illegal aliens up in three buckets [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=328.28s)]
*  so they can say, well, the border patrol is catching less. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=330.28s)]
*  They're catching less because you're moving thousands [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=332.28s)]
*  through these other two programs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=334.28s)]
*  So it's secure on the border and also under [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=336.28s)]
*  the deportation operation right out of the gate, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=338.28s)]
*  and we're going to demonstrate and prioritize public safety threats [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  and national security threats. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  So we want to arrest as many gang members [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  and public safety threats that the Biden administration [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  released in this country as many as we can, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  especially criminal alien gangs like Tren del Agua and MS-13. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  And finally, we got to start working on these children. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  And again, it's the most difficult task, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  but we're going to start day one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, working with private organizations, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  working with every American one, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  deputizing every American in this country [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  to help us find these kids. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's the success we saved alive, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=368.68s)]
*  but I'm hoping to find as many as possible. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=370.68s)]
*  So that's the goal we want, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=372.68s)]
*  and we're not going to stop. We got four years to do this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=374.68s)]
*  We want to remove every public safety threat, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=376.68s)]
*  every national security threat, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=378.68s)]
*  every gang member, every fugitive [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=380.68s)]
*  that had due process [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=382.68s)]
*  at great taxpayer expense or order removed [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=384.68s)]
*  by a federal judge, but failed to leave. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=386.68s)]
*  We got 1.7 million of them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=388.68s)]
*  We got 750,000 convicted criminal illegal aliens. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=390.68s)]
*  We got a big task ahead of us, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=394.68s)]
*  but the men and women of ICE, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=396.68s)]
*  they're patriots. We're going to get this done. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=398.68s)]
*  And you're calling for the private sector [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=400.68s)]
*  and we the people to help out as well, Tom, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=402.68s)]
*  and giving us direction and granularity, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=404.68s)]
*  which is so helpful. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=406.68s)]
*  And you're telling the country right now, Tom Homan, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=408.68s)]
*  that long before Joe Biden [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=410.68s)]
*  was showing depravity towards human life, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=412.68s)]
*  a lack of common sense and compassion [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=414.68s)]
*  by commuting these death row sentences [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=416.68s)]
*  to life without parole, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=418.68s)]
*  he was looking the other way and allowing these kids [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=420.68s)]
*  to be harmed and to come here and to go missing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=422.68s)]
*  We got 340,000 of them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=424.68s)]
*  Tom Homan, thank you so much. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=426.68s)]
*  God bless you and your family. Merry Christmas. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGtYNVTam04&t=428.68s)]
