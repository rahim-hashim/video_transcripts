# This trial is in ‘Biden town’: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o)
*  Here with reaction we have Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. Jonathan, let's get your take on the case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=0.0s)]
*  As an outside observer following it as closely as you, I felt the evidence was overwhelming, incontrovertible. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=4.8s)]
*  I thought, I actually was pretty impressed with the prosecution in this case and the case that they eventually did put on, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=11.5s)]
*  but only because they were forced to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, the prosecution did an admirable job. I mean, they were right on it. They had a very tight case. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=22.4s)]
*  What was most impressive is that Abby Lowell, the defense counsel, put up a series of defenses that collapsed within two days. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=29.9s)]
*  The prosecutors just methodically destroyed all of these claims. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=38.4s)]
*  And in a normal case, that jury would have been out for an hour and come back with a conviction. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=43.4s)]
*  I mean, this is very obviously an offense that was committed, but that's not what the real defense is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=50.4s)]
*  I mean, these, as implausible as these arguments are, they're really placeholders. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=57.4s)]
*  The defense is playing to a Delaware jury. This is Biden town. This is Wilmington. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=63.4s)]
*  This is where the home of the Biden family resides. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=68.9s)]
*  And I think they're hoping for jury nullification. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=74.4s)]
*  And to add to that is a certain degree of sympathy for someone who had a tragic fight with drug addiction. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=76.9s)]
*  So we'll see what happens tomorrow. There's no question, as in my view, that the government stuck the landing here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=85.4s)]
*  They proved the case. The question is whether they can get the jury to consider the evidence and not just who the defendant is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=92.4s)]
*  What do you think the most—and I think—I do respect Abbey as an attorney. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=100.4s)]
*  I think the one thing Hunter does have going for him is Abbey Lowell. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=104.4s)]
*  And I would argue there are not many great attorneys in D.C., but he is a good attorney for sure. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=108.4s)]
*  And I thought he did as effective a job as he could, considering the hand that he was dealt, which was awful. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=114.4s)]
*  With that said, do you think he was able to cast out in any area that sticks out in your mind? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=122.4s)]
*  No. No, I—you know, the argument that was made by Abbey starting out was maybe someone else checked the box. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=130.4s)]
*  And they brought this Mr. Cleveland forward, who just blew that out of the water and said, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=136.4s)]
*  I stood there, watched him check that box and the other boxes, and told him to take his time, which he did. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=141.4s)]
*  He then said, well, he was really sort of bum-rushed into buying a gun. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=148.4s)]
*  And Cleveland said, no, he came in intending to buy a gun. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=152.4s)]
*  And then there was this ludicrous argument that he had this sort of immaculate period of sobriety, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=156.4s)]
*  or at least he was just drinking, not using drugs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=162.4s)]
*  And the government destroyed it and showed a text the very next day where he's trying to meet Mookie to score more drugs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=166.4s)]
*  And the day after that, saying that he's doing crack in a car. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=174.4s)]
*  And he had witnesses come forward to say that when they saw him do crack, he was doing it every 20 minutes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=178.4s)]
*  So none of these things survived within two days. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=183.4s)]
*  But again, that's not the point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=188.4s)]
*  Do you agree with me— [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=190.4s)]
*  I'm sure the process—yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=191.4s)]
*  Professor, I apologize. I thought you were finished. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=193.4s)]
*  Do you agree with me that the real important issues that people should be concerned about—and this is a serious issue— [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=196.4s)]
*  the crime aspect and charging him here, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=203.4s)]
*  but I think the more serious issues involve how much money that this—that Hunter was making without experience, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=208.4s)]
*  at a time he's addicted to drugs, seemingly offering no services that we can identify as of now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=215.4s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=223.4s)]
*  You know, what's amazing about this case is that it blew away their own defenses that the media has been repeating for years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=225.4s)]
*  They've been suggesting that Hunter Biden really was this incredibly competent, in-demand businessman and international expert. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=232.4s)]
*  In his book and in this trial, it's clear that he was addicted and having a very difficult time managing the most basic parts of his life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=240.4s)]
*  But he was getting millions from these companies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=250.4s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Jonathan Turley, professor. Thank you for joining us now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=253.4s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=257.4s)]
*  Professor, you're actually on a satellite tonight. I don't have you on your little, you know, Zoom thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=262.4s)]
*  It's great to see you a little bit more clearly. We'll start with you tonight. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=268.4s)]
*  Let's get your take on the case. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=272.4s)]
*  Do you agree with the last question I asked Professor Turley, which is about, you know, this is low-hanging fruit, as far as I'm concerned, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=273.4s)]
*  considering the millions and millions of dollars that they brought into this family at a time he's addicted to drugs and at, you know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=281.4s)]
*  with no experience admittedly in an interview on Good Morning America. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=290.4s)]
*  Look, the best thing that could possibly happen to Donald Trump is if Hunter Biden gets acquitted because the evidence against Hunter Biden is so much, so much more compelling. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=296.4s)]
*  The legal issue is so much more compelling than anything against Donald Trump. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=307.4s)]
*  And it will prove beyond any doubt that this is all about where the trial was conducted, that if you're Trump and you tried in New York, it's automatic guilt. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=311.4s)]
*  And if you're Biden and you're tried in Delaware, it's a different verdict. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=320.4s)]
*  So the best thing that could possibly happen to Donald Trump is the acquittal of Biden based on all this evidence. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=324.4s)]
*  It would also be a good thing for America. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=329.4s)]
*  It would uncover and disclose the horrible double standard that our criminal justice system is going through. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=333.4s)]
*  Maybe we could get some reform. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=341.4s)]
*  Maybe we can do something about it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=343.4s)]
*  Right now, our criminal justice system is the laughing stock of the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=345.4s)]
*  And I feel just so horrible about it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=350.4s)]
*  I've devoted 60 years of my life to trying to defend and explain a legal system based on neutral principles. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=352.4s)]
*  That legal system is gone. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=360.4s)]
*  The Trump case destroyed it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=362.4s)]
*  And if there were an acquittal in this case, at least it would expose it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=364.4s)]
*  Now, there may be a conviction in this case because the evidence is so overwhelming. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=368.4s)]
*  That won't hurt Donald Trump. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=372.4s)]
*  But if there were an acquittal, it would help Donald Trump enormously in the court of public opinion. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=374.4s)]
*  Nobody would believe that the New York verdict was justified if there's an acquittal in this case. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=378.4s)]
*  There's such a difference in terms of the venue. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=384.4s)]
*  It seems, Greg, that if you want equal justice and equal application of our laws and you want constitutional order, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=387.4s)]
*  it's all going to depend on the venue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=394.4s)]
*  It's all going to depend on how politicized and weaponized the prosecutor may be and how abusively biased the judge can be. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=396.4s)]
*  Yeah, it blows a hole in the notion, constitutionally, of an impartial jury. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=407.4s)]
*  But here, the facts are so simple. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=413.4s)]
*  The law is clear. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=415.4s)]
*  The evidence of guilt overwhelming the defense argument that Hunter was in denial about his addictions. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=416.4s)]
*  So that somehow forgives his lie. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=422.4s)]
*  That is so absurd. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=425.4s)]
*  But look, if a hometown jury is already in your back pocket, then Jonathan's right sympathy and jury nullification might actually work. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=427.4s)]
*  And it doesn't matter that jurors are not allowed to negate the law. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=435.4s)]
*  They do it anyway sometimes because secrecy of deliberations protects them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=440.4s)]
*  They can do as they please without consequence. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=445.4s)]
*  But having said that, prosecutors do have an advantage. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=448.4s)]
*  They don't have to prove that Hunter was high on drugs or addicted on the day he bought the gun, only during the general timeframe. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=452.4s)]
*  And that was proven conclusively through text messages, photographs, witnesses, his own words from the book he wrote. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=460.4s)]
*  Hunter, it turns out, was the best witness against Hunter, which is precisely why he chose not to testify. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=467.4s)]
*  He would have been completely shredded on cross-examination. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=475.4s)]
*  All right. Predictions, Professor Dershowitz. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=479.4s)]
*  Well, I think the evidence is so overwhelming there could be a conviction. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=482.4s)]
*  But I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a jury nullification. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=488.4s)]
*  Remember, jury nullification cuts both ways. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=491.4s)]
*  What happened in New York was jury nullification. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=493.4s)]
*  The jury found an innocent person who committed no crime whatsoever guilty because of the judge's instruction and because the prosecutor made up a case. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=496.4s)]
*  That was jury nullification with judge nullification. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=505.4s)]
*  This could very well be a case of jury nullification as well. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=508.4s)]
*  Prediction, Greg Jarrett. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=512.4s)]
*  Well, this has been a no-nonsense, honest judge, a federal judge. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=514.4s)]
*  Huge difference between this judge and Mershawn. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=520.4s)]
*  If the jurors follow their duty as they must, there will be a conviction. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=523.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=529.4s)]
*  No outcome, be it guilty verdict, acquittal, hung jury. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=531.4s)]
*  Nothing will surprise me here, but we'll see. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=536.4s)]
*  All right. Thank you all. Appreciate it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=539.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5u-dtPa_o&t=553.4s)]
