# 'Grossly Unfair': Michael Avenatti speaks out on Trump's criminal trial
**Fox News:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg)
*  All right, New York's ridiculous trial. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=0.0s)]
*  A former president, Donald Trump, brought one name back into the headlines, a name you might [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=4.0s)]
*  remember from 2018, Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=8.6s)]
*  By the way, we reached out to Stormy's new attorney. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  They haven't got back to us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=16.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Avenatti is currently imprisoned after convictions for extortion, fraud, identity [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=18.12s)]
*  theft. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=23.12s)]
*  And he recently told Fox News Digital that he thinks Trump has become a, quote, victim [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=24.12s)]
*  of the system. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=29.08s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with Michael Avenatti about the case from prison. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=30.08s)]
*  All right, joining us now is Michael Avenatti. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Michael, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Good to be with you, Sean. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=40.56s)]
*  Nineteen years in prison, no possibility of parole. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=43.32s)]
*  That's daunting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=47.12s)]
*  I don't wish that on anybody, I'll be very honest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=48.12s)]
*  I'm not going to rehash all the stuff that goes behind this, but I'm sure that reality [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=51.76s)]
*  is now set in. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  What's your life like in there? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=58.24s)]
*  Well, I'm doing fine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=59.24s)]
*  You know, I'm very blessed, Sean. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=60.24s)]
*  I've gotten back in touch with my faith. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=63.24s)]
*  My family's stuck by me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, 19 years is a draconian sentence, and I've got some pending appeals. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=68.4s)]
*  It's far in excess of anything I should have ever received, but I'm trying to keep my chin [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=73.76s)]
*  up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=77.84s)]
*  OK, understand. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=78.84s)]
*  I'm sure it's not easy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=79.84s)]
*  Let me go to the heart of this case now that is going on in New York, about $130,000, you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=82.52s)]
*  know, eight years ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=90.16s)]
*  And you have said you defended Trump as a victim of the system. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of issues involving the statute of limitations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=98.4s)]
*  I have issues involving the judge and donating to Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  I have issues involving potential conflicts with his family. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=104.84s)]
*  I have problems with how did they get from a misdemeanor to felony charges on the federal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=108.92s)]
*  level? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=114.64s)]
*  As a lawyer, and I'll ask you that first, when you look at the charges itself and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=115.64s)]
*  time frame and the judge donating to Biden and possible other family conflicts, what's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=119.92s)]
*  your reaction to that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=124.72s)]
*  Case is grossly unfair, Sean, and that's going to come as a surprise to a lot of people, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=126.72s)]
*  but I strongly believe that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=131.08s)]
*  What is happening right now to President Trump—and let me be clear, I disagree with President [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=133.28s)]
*  Trump on about 95 percent of the issues at a minimum. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=138.12s)]
*  But one thing he and I agree on, and that is that the politicization of these cases, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=142.0s)]
*  in this case in particular, is gross, it's uncalled for, and it's flat out wrong. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  This is an effort to deprive millions of Americans of their choice for president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=153.88s)]
*  This guy has been indicted now in four cases up and down the entire East Coast. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Sean, in this country, we don't have serial killers who are prosecuted at the same time [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=165.72s)]
*  in four different cases. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  The timing is wrong, the case is wrong, and he's not receiving due process. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=173.8s)]
*  Let me ask you, because you were once—FoxNews.com did an article, and they had an interview [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  with you, and they pointed out the one-time, quote, most dangerous enemy of Donald Trump, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=185.4s)]
*  a lot of people on the left thought would bring down President Trump's—bring down [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=193.32s)]
*  his presidency. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=197.36s)]
*  And you know, I remember at the time—I actually met you one time, and I remember at the time [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=199.72s)]
*  that you were passionate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=205.96s)]
*  You had the media all over you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=208.12s)]
*  You had the media even suggesting, some of them, that you might run for president one [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=210.04s)]
*  day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=214.28s)]
*  And obviously you're taking a very different posture now about the case, about where you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=215.88s)]
*  were then, what you were saying then, and what you are saying now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=220.94s)]
*  Is it your experience that contributed to this, or is this the entire—the totality [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=225.74s)]
*  of what happened with you and your former client, the totality of what happened, I guess, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=232.56s)]
*  with Michael Cohen, the totality of what happened in your own life? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=237.34s)]
*  Explain—it's such a different—it's such a different Michael Avenatti to me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=241.62s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=246.02s)]
*  Well, I think it's all of what you mentioned, Sean. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=247.02s)]
*  I do recall when we met, actually, and I recall you and I got along pretty well, actually, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  that night. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=254.73999999999998s)]
*  But separate and apart from that, I've learned a lot over the last five to six years, Sean. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  You know, I've been a product of the system, if you will. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=260.74s)]
*  I've been ground through the system, fighting three cases at one time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=264.86s)]
*  I've learned a lot about the media. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=268.74s)]
*  I've learned a lot about what it's like when the government comes for you, when you're [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=270.5s)]
*  targeted. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=274.46s)]
*  I've learned a lot about what it means to really get due process, or to be deprived [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=275.46s)]
*  of due process. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=279.62s)]
*  And so, you know, they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=280.62s)]
*  Well, I guess that's not true, because I've certainly grown a lot and learned a lot over [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=284.7s)]
*  the last five years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=289.14s)]
*  And that's why I'm saying what I'm saying now, and I firmly believe it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=290.62s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=294.9s)]
*  I mean, if you were to testify in this case, you know that the prosecution would want to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=295.9s)]
*  impeach you as a witness, and obviously all the issues you've had to deal with over [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=301.58s)]
*  the last number of years, all of that would be brought up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  How would you handle that? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  I'd handle it directly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=312.54s)]
*  I'd handle it truthfully. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  And I can promise you that I'd be a hell of a lot better witness than Michael Cohen could [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  ever hope to be. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=318.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=320.26s)]
*  And coming up, a Secret Service officer assigned to Kamala Harris' detail. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  This is breaking news. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=326.14s)]
*  Reportedly had an altercation with other agents. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=327.22s)]
*  We have that live report straight ahead. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezHFKtC2UDg&t=330.18s)]
