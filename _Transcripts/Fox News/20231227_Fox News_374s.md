# Biden admin officials attempted to hide Chinese spy balloon from public: Report
**Fox News:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=0.0s)]
*  Whether Biden realizes it or not, the world is at war. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=1.0s)]
*  In Crimea, Ukraine just blew up a large Russian warship as that conflict rages on with no [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=4.84s)]
*  end in sight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=10.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel is now battling Iranian proxies on multiple fronts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Other Iran-backed proxies are targeting cargo ships all over the region. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  On Saturday, terrorists struck a ship off the Indian coast with an unmanned aerial vehicle. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  This as Iranian scientists have reportedly increased the rate of uranium enrichment as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=28.44s)]
*  they get closer to achieving a nuclear bomb capability. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=33.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Pacific, China continues to threaten America's allies while Biden [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=37.08s)]
*  does nothing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  And get this, the administration tried to conceal last February's Chinese spy balloon [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  incursion? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Were they trying to save China from embarrassment? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=49.72s)]
*  Joining us now with reaction, the former national security adviser for President Trump, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=52.88s)]
*  Ambassador Robert O'Brien. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us tonight on Hannity. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  You know, we just went through this with John Ratcliffe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=63.56s)]
*  You served Armand and glove with him and handed glove with him there in the Trump administration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=65.56s)]
*  But, you know, let's start with China because China is on the march. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  They're not threatened by us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=75.72s)]
*  They're not worried about what the United States might do because they see Biden doing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=77.16s)]
*  nothing else around the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=80.56s)]
*  Well, Jason, you're absolutely right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=83.88s)]
*  And John Ratcliffe was right in his analysis that he just gave you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=85.28s)]
*  Look, the maximum the peace of strength keeps America safe works. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=89.12s)]
*  It's true. And weakness in foreign is provocative. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  When we're weak, our adversaries take advantage of us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=98.36s)]
*  And we're seeing that with the Houthis, the Qatib Hezbollah, Iran, Hamas, the Russians and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  now the Chinese. And what's very disturbing is we just learned that Xi Jinping [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=106.48s)]
*  in his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco, which I mean, the one benefit from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=110.52s)]
*  the meeting is San Francisco cleaned up for a couple of days. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  So that was nice for the people of San Francisco. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=118.56s)]
*  They were able to go out and walk on their streets for a couple of days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=120.16s)]
*  But he told Biden flat out, we're going to take Taiwan and there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=122.24s)]
*  So a very disturbing message and something that we're not responding to. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Iran, because if you go over to the Middle East, Iran is there behind [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=133.68s)]
*  Hezbollah. They're behind Hamas. They're behind the Houthis. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of Americans don't know who the Houthis are, but they should be a feckless terrorist group [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=142.84s)]
*  that we could take care of in a moment's notice if we just had the political will to take care of it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=149.4s)]
*  But it's all because of Iran, correct? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=153.24s)]
*  It is. And look, the Houthis wouldn't fire a BB gun at a ship. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=156.84s)]
*  The Hamas wouldn't have crossed the border from Gaza into Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  None of this would have happened without the Iranians signing off. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  These are bought and paid for proxies. Hezbollah, Khatib Hezbollah, which is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=166.36s)]
*  killing and injuring our soldiers in Iraq and Syria. This is all coming from Iran, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=170.84s)]
*  and we're doing nothing about it. But the most concerning thing about Iran, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  and we're watching the Iranian missiles parade by as we speak right now on your screen, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=179.56s)]
*  is our nuclear program. And if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, we're going to have real trouble. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=184.68s)]
*  We need to avoid that at any cost. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's the concern, right, is that the United Nations watchdog group has now said that, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  unlike what they were doing in the past, which was slowing down their enrichment, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=198.28s)]
*  they've now sped it up. And there are a lot of people out there that believe that they are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  moments, if not inches away, of achieving a nuclear capability, which for the world's safety and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=205.96s)]
*  security, I mean, that cannot be anything worse than an Iranian government with money, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  and then the resources to deliver a nuclear bomb. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=220.92s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, without getting into the details, the Iranians are very close to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=224.76s)]
*  having a nuclear weapon, and they're very close to putting on a delivery system to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  menace Israel or our ships in the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. But think about this, Jason, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=231.64s)]
*  if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, what do you think the Saudis are going to do? The Saudis [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=237.72s)]
*  just paid a billion dollars to buy Phil Mickelson and John Rahm and a golf league. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=241.56s)]
*  You don't think they'll spend 10 times that much to buy a nuclear capability if their archrivals [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=247.16s)]
*  of Iran have it? And what do you think Egypt, the leader of the Arab world, or Turkey, which has been [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=250.28s)]
*  fighting Iran since before either country was Muslim, what do you think they're going to do [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  about it? We're going to have a nuclear arms race in the middle of the most dangerous part, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=258.52s)]
*  dangerous neighborhood in the world, and it's going to be brought on because instead of putting Iran [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=263.48s)]
*  in a box, like John Draglip talked about, Jason, we had Iran bankrupt, and we had to do something [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  to get it back. The Biden administration came in and said, if we just give them enough money, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=274.76s)]
*  if we just buy it and give them a hostage ransom, if we just turn a blind eye to sanctions, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=279.88s)]
*  if we just let them get rich again, they'll be nice to us. They're not nice to us. They're not [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=283.56s)]
*  that into us, and they're taking all that money, as you pointed out, to build a nuclear program. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=287.48s)]
*  Now, that's going to put Israel at danger. The former president of Iran said that Israel is a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=291.96s)]
*  one-bomb country. What do you mean by that? He meant we can kill all the Jews in Israel with [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=296.68s)]
*  one bomb because Israel is a small country. It scores miles wide and in length, so that puts [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=300.6s)]
*  Israel at danger. Think about a future American president. If there's a crisis in the Middle East [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  and we want to send a carrier group to the Middle East, and we send a carrier group, that carrier [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=312.36s)]
*  group with 5,000 sailors and pilots on it are going to be at danger of one nuclear weapon from [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=316.6s)]
*  Iran could wipe out an entire carrier battle group. They'll control the whole area. They'll be able to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=321.8s)]
*  blackmail us, blackmail our allies, and potentially destroy and commit the ultimate genocide against [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=325.64s)]
*  Israel. It's a very dangerous situation, and we're facilitating it with all the resources we're giving [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=330.68s)]
*  them. Well, President Biden and Kamala Harris better get their act together because they're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  not standing up for the United States of America. They're not protecting the men and women who are [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=341.96s)]
*  actually serving us with more than 100 attacks. These little pinpricks of a response are not [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=346.28s)]
*  getting the job done. You're not speaking the language that people would understand, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=351.8s)]
*  not on the border, not around the world. Ambassador Robert O'Brien, thank you for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=355.32s)]
*  joining us tonight on Hannity. Do appreciate it. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdss0D7j9CY&t=359.72s)]
