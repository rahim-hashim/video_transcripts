# Incoming ‘border czar’ rips border crisis bringing in terrorism risks
**Fox News:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4)
*  Joining us now with more on how to improve our national security. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=0.0s)]
*  There's so much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=4.2s)]
*  Incoming czar, Tom—border czar, czar in general. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=5.4s)]
*  Tom, I'll make you the czar of everything. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=9.32s)]
*  Tom Homan is with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=11.16s)]
*  You know, it's—you know, you've got a lot on your plate. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=12.76s)]
*  Everyone, we know, is praying for New Orleans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=16.6s)]
*  They're praying for you, President Trump, everyone coming in, Marco Rubio. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  It's a whole team of people who now are going to have this country's back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=27.48s)]
*  When you see this, a Biden statement, three minutes long, not really encouraging, very [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=28.64s)]
*  strange kind of statements about, you know, who he was and that he was an American, like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=35.88s)]
*  that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=41.84s)]
*  It's very strange, because now we have millions of people—we don't know who they are—hundreds [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=42.84s)]
*  of people regarding the terrorist watch list, people who are dangerous, who are roaming [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=51.8s)]
*  What do you think this says? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=52.8s)]
*  Is this going to be a normal occurrence, or is this just the burst of a couple of rogue [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=54.12s)]
*  terrorists or coincidences? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=60.04s)]
*  What's your take so far today? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  No, more is coming. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=64.24s)]
*  I think both these incidents, Las Vegas and New Orleans, they're both going to be U.S. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=67.0s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=72.88s)]
*  They're both going to have recent foreign travel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=73.88s)]
*  They're both on a suicide mission. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=75.36s)]
*  Neither one thought they were going to go home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=77.4s)]
*  And I think you're going to see ISIS affiliation on both of them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  But you know, the president bragged today, you know, this is U.S. citizen America, and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=84.44s)]
*  he shouldn't hang his hat on that, because let's remember, just a couple months ago, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  we arrested eight people from Tajikistan in New York City, Philadelphia and L.A. that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  were planning a terrorist-type event, a Russian-type terrorist event here in the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=97.04s)]
*  Luckily, the intel community called them before they did it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=101.84s)]
*  And let's remember, we got over two million gotaways, known gotaways, on our southern borders. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Border patrols arrested people from 180 countries. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=109.4s)]
*  Many of these countries sponsored terror. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=111.76s)]
*  They arrested over 300 people on the terrorist watch list. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Under Trump, we had 14. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  So I won't hang his hat on, you know, these attacks being done by U.S. citizens. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=117.84s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=121.56s)]
*  Even Chris Foray, who I have very little respect for, says the southern border is the biggest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=122.68s)]
*  national security vulnerability he's ever seen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=126.28s)]
*  You know, also, just the fact, the inspiration of it, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=128.52s)]
*  I think that was the Al Qaeda magazine name, right, is that it's an inspiration for people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=132.88s)]
*  And when—you know, just the fact that there seems to be no one at home, no matter who [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=138.2s)]
*  you are or where you're coming in from, it inspires the bad actors. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  It's like, if you want to get something done now, this is the time to do it, because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  no one's at home, and you know Trump is coming in 19 days. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And that seems to be something that people, the bad guys, are concerned about, as they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  should be. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=161.16s)]
*  Well, look, they've been emboldened. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=162.16s)]
*  Look what this administration done. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=165.16s)]
*  First of all, they relaxed the sanctions against Iran, gave them billions of more dollars [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=166.88s)]
*  to confront terrorism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=170.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=171.76s)]
*  You know, you see marches down New York City, streets in New York City, on the college campuses [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=172.76s)]
*  of people carrying ISIS flags and asking for the death of America. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=177.4s)]
*  And we allow this stuff to happen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=182.9s)]
*  This administration took a weak stance on this stuff. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=184.24s)]
*  And the southern border, I'll mention again, tomorrow, I guarantee you, this week they're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=186.96s)]
*  going to continue to release thousands of people from the southern border, either through [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=191.84s)]
*  the CBP-1 app, or they're going to fly in men from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=195.36s)]
*  to the CHMV program through our airports. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=200.4s)]
*  Then border patrols are going to release thousands of more. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=204.0s)]
*  Nothing's going to change the more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  This administration is not taking action against the criminal cartels and terrorist organizations [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  or trying to secure our southern border. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=212.4s)]
*  You can't have national security if you don't have border security. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know the—I don't understand why they don't get that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=219.12s)]
*  I mean, it's common sense. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=222.56s)]
*  You know, and this is—people are thinking about, you know, the nature of who comes across [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=223.76s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=227.16s)]
*  As you've mentioned, you know, there's dozens of other countries, other than Mexicans, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=228.16s)]
*  the OTMs, as they call them, from China, from Tajikistan, right, Cuba, and we're flying [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=232.12s)]
*  them in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=239.32s)]
*  It's a remarkable statement. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=240.32s)]
*  Without any vetting at this point, it's almost like a deliberate, unforced error. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=242.84s)]
*  Like, you want this dynamic in here, and it's frightening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=250.8s)]
*  What will be some of the first day—we always wonder what President Trump will do on his [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=254.56s)]
*  first day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=259.2s)]
*  For you, what is your first day agenda? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=260.24s)]
*  What are the first things you need to get rid of and do, like the app and dealing with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  some of the elements with the border? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=268.04s)]
*  What's on your first day agenda? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=269.48s)]
*  First week, first day? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=271.32s)]
*  Well, I think, number—day one, President Trump's going to secure the border. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=273.12s)]
*  I think at the same time he's secure the border, and we're going to do that by ending [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=277.96s)]
*  these ridiculous programs. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  You need to end CHNV. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=283.4s)]
*  You need to end the CBP-1 app, the way it's being used now, and catch and release. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=284.4s)]
*  If you cross the border illegally, you're going to be detained. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=290.2s)]
*  Either that or removed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=292.12s)]
*  The law is clear. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=293.46s)]
*  If you enter this country without proper documentation, you shall be detained. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=294.64s)]
*  That's what the statute says. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=298.24s)]
*  You shall be detained. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=299.48s)]
*  Not maybe, not thinking about, let's release you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=300.6s)]
*  You shall be detained, and that's what the Trump administration will do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=302.76s)]
*  President Trump is committed to that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=305.48s)]
*  We're going to start the biggest deportation operation ever seen. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=306.68s)]
*  And right out of the gate, we're going to concentrate on public safety threats and national [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=309.88s)]
*  security threats. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  That's why I get angry when I see governors and mayors saying they're going to try to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  prevent this from happening, especially after today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  What governor or mayor wants to stand in the way of removing public safety threats from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  the community? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=324.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=325.32s)]
*  It is their own constituents using them like pawns in an environment that ruins everyone's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=326.32s)]
*  lives. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=332.32s)]
*  This kind of crime, nobody knew who's all these people injured and the 15 murdered. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=333.4s)]
*  We don't care about their political party. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=339.88s)]
*  We don't care about whether they're black or white or gay or straight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=341.7s)]
*  They're Americans or perhaps they're visitors. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=345.36s)]
*  They're people having a good time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=348.52s)]
*  It transcends all of that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=350.42s)]
*  And that's, I know, what you're focused on, what President Trump is focused on as [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=352.38s)]
*  well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=355.28s)]
*  The 20th, sir, can't come soon enough. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAA7847iiz4&t=356.28s)]
