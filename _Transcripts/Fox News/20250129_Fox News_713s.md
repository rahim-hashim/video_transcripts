# JD Vance: Trump has 'incredible energy' and a 'genius' way of making decisions
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM)
*  Mr. Vice President, great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=2.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  First of all, congratulations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=4.32s)]
*  All right, has it sunk in yet? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=5.32s)]
*  Hillbilly Elegy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=8.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=9.36s)]
*  Now the Vice President of the United States of America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=10.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of crazy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=12.72s)]
*  You know, it hasn't sunk in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=13.72s)]
*  And, you know, I joke that I took two wrong turns and I ended up, you know, a hallway [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=15.36s)]
*  down from the Oval Office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=20.64s)]
*  And it's just an incredible thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=21.64s)]
*  You know, the first time I'd ever actually been to the Oval Office was with President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=23.2s)]
*  Trump as his Vice President last Tuesday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=26.72s)]
*  You'd never been there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=28.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, he always talks about, you know, you have these executives, foreign heads [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  of state. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  The Oval Office just has a particular power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  And I certainly felt it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=39.28s)]
*  And it was just amazing to stand in that room. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=40.88s)]
*  And I remember at the time thinking, I wish that I had something profound to say. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=42.84s)]
*  And I just stood in there saying, wow, this is crazy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=49.56s)]
*  No, I had the same experience when I went in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=50.56s)]
*  President Bush was in office at the time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  And I remember, I thought it was surreal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  I was like, is that really him? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=55.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  And it is a special place. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=59.16s)]
*  And then, of course, Trump has his little red button, which I have next to him, which [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=61.92s)]
*  is not the red button. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=66.72s)]
*  Which he screwed with me about that, actually. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=68.48s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=71.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=72.12s)]
*  No, so we're just mid-conversation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=73.12s)]
*  I think we were with Senator Thune and Speaker Johnson. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=74.12s)]
*  And he has this sort of beautiful ornate wooden box on his desk with a red button. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=77.68s)]
*  And he presses it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  And he just kind of looks over at me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=83.56s)]
*  And I'm like, sir, is that—did something bad just happen? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=84.84s)]
*  And he's like, no, I just ordered a Diet Coke. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=89.24s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=90.96s)]
*  It's the Diet Coke red button. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  And it comes running in. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  And then he'll ask you, would you like one? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=96.04s)]
*  I've known President Trump for over 30 years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=98.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=100.24s)]
*  I've had a close relationship with him in all those years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=101.24s)]
*  And he and I, when he was thinking about running, we had arguments for hours deep into the night [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=104.16s)]
*  about—I said, I'm not voting for you if you're not a conservative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=110.12s)]
*  You really are now getting to know him very well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=113.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=116.2s)]
*  What have you learned about him? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=117.2s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=118.76s)]
*  One, I've learned that he has the most interesting decision-making process of any person I've [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=119.76s)]
*  ever met. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=126.0s)]
*  And I think it's what makes him such an effective leader is that when he actually is thinking [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=127.0s)]
*  about doing something, he doesn't just ask, like, you know, his closest advisor or some [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=130.88s)]
*  policy person. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, if it's going to affect a business, he'll call the business the CEO. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  So he'll go and try to talk to the workers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=141.76s)]
*  He tries to take inputs from everywhere. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's one of the reasons why he's so in tune with where the American people [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=146.44s)]
*  actually are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's also, I think, one of the geniuses of the way that he makes decisions is that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=151.76s)]
*  he actually tries to talk to everybody. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's something, honestly, I could write a book just about the way that he gathers [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=157.48s)]
*  information from all sources. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=162.0s)]
*  And it's very unusual. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, in Washington, most politicians, you know, they'll—if it's a national security [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=165.48s)]
*  issue, they'll talk to their national security person and maybe, you know, somebody else [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=169.92s)]
*  in their office. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=173.44s)]
*  Maybe it's a business issue. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=174.56s)]
*  Maybe they'll talk to a CEO. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=175.56s)]
*  The president talks to everybody. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=176.76s)]
*  And that's a very, very profound thing about the way that he actually operates in Washington. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=178.94s)]
*  I would describe him as a force of nature, and there's nobody else like him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=182.8s)]
*  And I think in many ways he's misunderstood as well, because I know the personal side [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=187.52s)]
*  of him and I know the business side of him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=190.9s)]
*  And as we've seen hundreds and hundreds of executive actions— [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=193.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=199.44s)]
*  —and you've been here barely a little over a week now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=200.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=203.04s)]
*  It's speed of light. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=204.64s)]
*  You know, we've, I think, accomplished honestly more in eight days than the entire Biden administration [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=205.64s)]
*  accomplished in four years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=210.68s)]
*  Of course, the things that we're accomplishing are actually good things, and the things they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=211.88s)]
*  were accomplishing were mostly bad things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=214.64s)]
*  But the president has incredible energy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is something you hear other people say about him, and it's hard to really appreciate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=218.72s)]
*  it until you're up close and personal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=224.04s)]
*  I don't know how much he sleeps or if he ever really sleeps. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=225.76s)]
*  I mean, you'll get phone calls from him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=229.04s)]
*  I can answer that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't sleep a lot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=232.8s)]
*  You'll get phone calls at one in the morning, and he'll just, you know, he'll talk about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=233.8s)]
*  policy and he'll talk about your family. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=237.4s)]
*  And he just—there's something incredibly energetic about him, but you sort of need that, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=239.4s)]
*  actually. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  The federal government has become so sprawling, and the bureaucracy is so unresponsive to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  what the president actually wants to do, that you kind of need somebody in there who's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=250.62s)]
*  constantly on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  It's all gas, no breaks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=256.0s)]
*  That's certainly what we've seen in the last, you know, eight days. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's what we'll see for the next four years. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=260.52s)]
*  You know, when you look at, for example, the two biggest issues in this campaign, immigration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=263.08s)]
*  and the economy— [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=268.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=269.24s)]
*  —because that's impacting the people in Ohio. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=270.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=273.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=274.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=275.2s)]
*  That's impacting their life hard. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=276.2s)]
*  And a lot of Americans have been really hurt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=277.2s)]
*  There was a study that came out, like, 56 percent of Americans can't withstand a $1,000 emergency. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=279.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=286.28s)]
*  You know, it would be devastating for them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=287.28s)]
*  That scares me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=289.2s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=290.2s)]
*  I've lived there. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=291.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=292.96s)]
*  Not fun. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=293.96s)]
*  Not where you want to be. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=294.96s)]
*  Not fun at all. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=295.96s)]
*  And when I think of, you know, the issue of immigration in particular, I'm looking at—we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=296.96s)]
*  have known terrorists in this country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=306.44s)]
*  We have known cartel members, known gang members. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=307.44s)]
*  We have known murderers, rapists. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm watching the reaction of the left and the left-wing media and the Democrats. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=316.32s)]
*  And you know, we're back to Nazi fascists, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=322.12s)]
*  And I'm like, what part of these other people are you missing? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=326.12s)]
*  No, it's totally crazy, Sean. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=330.04s)]
*  And if you look, you know, there was the guy who went viral a few days ago that we deported, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=332.08s)]
*  17 violent criminal convictions, and was actually saying— [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=337.24s)]
*  The guy from Haiti. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=340.8s)]
*  The guy from Haiti. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=341.8s)]
*  I hate Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=342.92s)]
*  I love Biden because Biden wanted me to stay in this country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=344.16s)]
*  Is there a better endorsement of Donald J. Trump that a violent criminal who shouldn't [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  be in this country doesn't like him because Donald Trump is actually enforcing the immigration [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=351.6s)]
*  laws of this country? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=355.98s)]
*  And it's everywhere, Sean. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=356.98s)]
*  It affects everybody from all walks of life. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=359.16s)]
*  It's the drug epidemic. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the crime. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=363.6s)]
*  It's the fact that if you live along the southern border, you're affected by this cartel activity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=364.6s)]
*  We've seen, Sean, just in the last couple of days, multiple cartel members have fired [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=369.24s)]
*  at our own border patrol. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=373.56s)]
*  And you ask yourself, why wasn't that happening a couple of years ago? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=374.92s)]
*  Because they weren't empowered to do their job. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=378.92s)]
*  The border has become so lawless that we're actually engaging in military-style engagements [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=381.58s)]
*  just to regain control of our southern border. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=388.76s)]
*  And thank God we're actually doing it this time, because if we had another four years [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=391.36s)]
*  the Democrats wide open southern border, it would permanently and I think irreparably [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=397.04s)]
*  transform this country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=400.8s)]
*  So yeah, we're doing immigration enforcement in a big way. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=402.12s)]
*  We're also doing things to lower the cost of energy, because of course, if we can lower [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=405.04s)]
*  the cost of energy, we're going to make food and housing, groceries, everything else more [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  affordable for American citizens. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=413.44s)]
*  And that really is, you're exactly right, that is the two prongs of the Trump agenda. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  We want to create more prosperity and we want to create more security. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  And we're doing a lot. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=423.6s)]
*  We're going to do a lot more. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=424.6s)]
*  I want to ask about the economy in a second, but we saw Tom Homan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=425.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's anyone more. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=430.68s)]
*  Talk about a force of nature. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  I've tried to make him smile. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  I've had no luck. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=436.56s)]
*  If you pull that off, that would be a miracle. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=437.56s)]
*  But I've known him a long time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=440.12s)]
*  I have a great admiration for him. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=441.88s)]
*  Me too. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=443.56s)]
*  And almost 10,000 deportations and some of the toughest criminals. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=444.56s)]
*  Kristi Noem out on that ice raid in New York yesterday. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=449.12s)]
*  She was on TV with us last night. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=452.4s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=454.16s)]
*  And in the last 10,000 in a week, the president is looking for what, 1,800 a day? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=455.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=459.12s)]
*  And, you know, that's a pretty ambitious goal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=460.12s)]
*  It's ambitious, but you need a leader who sets ambitious goals and actually holds people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  to meeting those goals. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=466.8s)]
*  If you think we've got 20-plus million illegal aliens in this country, we have got to get [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  these people out of our country and regain control of our own border. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=473.0s)]
*  And it's not just the people that we're deporting. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=477.88s)]
*  If you look at the number of illegal entries on January the 19th, the last day of the Democrats [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=479.76s)]
*  administration, I believe the number was north of 1,300 illegal entries. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=485.68s)]
*  Five days later, we had already cut that by more than 60 percent, and I guarantee we're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  going to cut it even further. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=494.84s)]
*  Policy matters. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=497.36s)]
*  Elections have consequences, and President Trump ran explicitly on regaining control [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  of the border and redelivering American prosperity. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=503.68s)]
*  That's exactly what we're doing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=507.0s)]
*  And it is funny, Sean, to hear the media and the Democrats howl about this and say, well, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=508.84s)]
*  you know, this is bad, this is terrible, you know, this is, like you said, fascist, Nazi, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=513.16s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  The president promised the American people he was going to do this. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=519.28s)]
*  They gave him a mandate, so now he's doing it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=523.28s)]
*  That's how democratic politics in this country works, and thank God for that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  If I was in your position or President Trump's position, and I never will be, let's be clear, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=529.68s)]
*  but if I was, I think what would keep me up at night is the fact that we have known [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=535.56s)]
*  terrorists in the country and we have murders in the country and rapists and violent criminals, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=540.8s)]
*  cartels and gang members, as I said. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=546.88s)]
*  I'm worried about an attack on the homeland, Mr. Vice President. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  How worried are you? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I am worried, Sean, because we were given a country with hundreds, maybe [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  thousands, maybe more of known terrorists that are in the United States of America thanks [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=558.68s)]
*  to the open borders of the last administration. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=563.68s)]
*  So it's our job to worry about it so that hopefully we can prevent that attack. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=566.12s)]
*  So it's something that does keep us up at night. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=569.76s)]
*  It's something that the government is working on very aggressively. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=572.28s)]
*  We've got great intelligence services. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=575.12s)]
*  We've got great border enforcement. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=577.4s)]
*  We're trying to identify the bad guys and get them out of our country, because, look, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=579.06s)]
*  what you don't want to have happen, Sean, is let's say we take a foreign policy action [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=584.36s)]
*  that some foreign terrorist organization doesn't like. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=588.9s)]
*  Well, now these guys, they're not in Syria or some foreign country. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=591.6400000000001s)]
*  They're in our backyards. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=596.12s)]
*  They're in our cities. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=597.12s)]
*  We have to get them out to make the homeland safer, but also to empower the president to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=598.36s)]
*  do the things that he needs to do when it comes to national security. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=602.6s)]
*  So it does worry me, but we also have a government that's actually tackling this issue. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=605.7600000000001s)]
*  It's getting better every single day. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=610.72s)]
*  How do we find them? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=612.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have known terrorists, but you don't know where they are. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=614.32s)]
*  Known cartel members, but you don't know where they are. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=618.46s)]
*  It's crazy, Sean. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=620.86s)]
*  Sometimes you're right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=621.86s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=622.86s)]
*  Sometimes we actually do. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=623.86s)]
*  And that's one of the craziest things of the last week. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=625.26s)]
*  Just for me, you asked what is shocking to me. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=627.42s)]
*  It's that many of these violent criminals, we knew their addresses. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=630.22s)]
*  We knew their names. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=634.34s)]
*  We just needed to send somebody to go to their house and get them the hell out of the country. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=635.38s)]
*  That really should shock the American people. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=640.02s)]
*  We've known where they are. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=642.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=643.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=644.74s)]
*  And we've known they've had terror ties. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=645.74s)]
*  We've known at least that they had violent criminal backgrounds, and we haven't done [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=646.74s)]
*  anything until about eight days ago when Donald Trump became the president of the United [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=650.58s)]
*  States again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=654.46s)]
*  It really should shock the conscience of the American people. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=655.58s)]
*  One of the things you heard on the campaign trail, one of the criticisms of me and of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=659.0200000000001s)]
*  the president was, well, yes, we have 20 million illegal aliens. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=662.14s)]
*  We have close to a million violent criminal illegal aliens, and we don't know where they [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=665.7s)]
*  are. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=670.34s)]
*  It turns out we actually do know where a lot of them are. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=671.34s)]
*  We just haven't had immigration enforcement, and that's what's changed so radically. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=673.9000000000001s)]
*  That actually gives me hope that we can protect the homeland, because I would imagine if you're [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=677.62s)]
*  a terrorist and you're in our country, you're not here to pursue a better life for you and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=681.86s)]
*  your children. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=686.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_G3_BXBjoM&t=687.86s)]
