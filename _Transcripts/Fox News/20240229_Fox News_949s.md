# Trump: Texas is now a ‘war zone’
**Fox News:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU)
*  Anyway, we'll keep scrolling that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, though, for the hour is former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=2.1s)]
*  As with us, sir, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=4.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=6.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=7.76s)]
*  On the day you came down the escalator, this was a big issue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=8.76s)]
*  You were attacked right out of the box that day when you came down that escalator. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=11.72s)]
*  On this issue? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=17.18s)]
*  Well, I was hearing about it from a lot of people, and it was one of the primary reasons [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=18.18s)]
*  in 2016 that I ran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=22.42s)]
*  And I ran on the border, and I ran on other things, but I ran on the border largely. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=24.22s)]
*  We fixed the problem, and in 2020 it wasn't even a subject. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=29.18s)]
*  I'd go out and say, I want to talk about the border. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=32.22s)]
*  They'd say, sir, you fixed the border. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=34.14s)]
*  Nobody cares about the border anymore. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  Now what's happened is since the election, where we got millions more votes than we did [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=38.14s)]
*  the first time, we have a situation where this border makes 2016 look like baby stuff. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=42.66s)]
*  It's probably the worst border. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=49.66s)]
*  Not probably. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  It's the worst border ever in the history of the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  There's never been a border where 15, 16, maybe 18 million people have already crossed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=54.3s)]
*  And I think nobody has any idea what the number is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  You know, the gotaways, I don't know what the gotaways are. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=62.42s)]
*  We have millions and millions of people, and they come from jails and prisons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=64.74s)]
*  They come from mental institutions, and you know, a step above that, the insane asylums. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=68.74s)]
*  And you just, it's just hard to believe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=74.58s)]
*  And you have terrorists coming. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=76.42s)]
*  You know, I've noticed, as somebody that watches your show a lot, I think you're, I think you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=77.78s)]
*  do a fantastic job, but you say 100% certain, I hate to hear it, that we're going to have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  a big attack at some point. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  That you're 100%... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=89.78s)]
*  I prayed that I'm wrong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=90.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=92.26s)]
*  And that's a very sad thing, but I've heard you say it a few times that I said, I'm not [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=94.06s)]
*  going to dispute it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=98.62s)]
*  I hope you're wrong, but there's certainly a good chance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=99.62s)]
*  They're coming from numbers in countries that we wouldn't believe. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=102.42s)]
*  So you have 28,000 from China, all fighting age. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  You don't see women and you don't see men much older than that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  You have terrorists from 18 to 25, 26 years old. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=111.7s)]
*  And there's something going on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  And they're coming from Yemen that we're bombing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=116.22s)]
*  They're coming from the Congo, from prisons in the Congo. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  The only good thing is it makes our prisoners look like very nice people, I'll tell you, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=121.94s)]
*  because these are rough people that are coming in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=125.82s)]
*  When you see them from Venezuela fighting, having fistfights with the cops, we never [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=127.62s)]
*  saw that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  You'd see cops be... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  A lot of bad things happen to cops, but you never saw people standing in the middle of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  a street in a fistfight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=139.18s)]
*  And if that happened in their country, they'd kill them within seconds. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=141.18s)]
*  They wouldn't allow it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  So it's a very terrible thing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=146.24s)]
*  Our country is being poisoned. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=148.9s)]
*  We're really being poisoned. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=150.34s)]
*  And it's hard to believe. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, as a business guy, you always want to understand the other side. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  I want to understand, what is the other side thinking, even if you disagree? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=155.9s)]
*  I don't know what they're thinking, because who can want this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=159.62s)]
*  Who can want millions of people from lots of bad places pouring into our country? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=162.06s)]
*  And you're right, we have not seen... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=167.38s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=169.36s)]
*  You know, we're just starting to see... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=170.72s)]
*  I call it migrant crime. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=172.16s)]
*  I really call it Biden migrant crime, but it's too long. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=173.55999999999997s)]
*  So let's just call it migrant crime, and everyone's going to know it's because of Biden. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  But we've never had anything like this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  We have an inflow of people at numbers that are unbelievable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  And you go back to New York and you see hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=185.72s)]
*  And you can see, look, the mayor is trying. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=189.54s)]
*  He wants to do a job, but it's just... [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=193.88s)]
*  Well, he made the city a sanctuary. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=194.88s)]
*  They made New York City a sanctuary city. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=196.48s)]
*  I want to go back to what you referred to, what I've been saying, because I point out... [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=198.28s)]
*  We'll put it up on the screen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  The numbers of people coming from Iran, the number one state sponsor is terror. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  There's satellite Syria. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=210.44s)]
*  You have the home of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  Thousands came coming from Egypt that we know of. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  Thousands coming from Afghanistan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  Now al-Qaeda has training camps up again. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  Then over 10, 12, 14,000 from Russia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=222.52s)]
*  And I read recently over 37,000 recently from China. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=226.48s)]
*  Now why would they make that long journey to our southern border? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=231.04s)]
*  And my fear is that we are... [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=235.76s)]
*  We have in this country, because these illegals are not vetted, I fear that terror cells have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=238.2s)]
*  set up in this country that will plot, plan, scheme the next 9-11 or worse. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=244.12s)]
*  I pray to God, as I said, I'm wrong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=250.76s)]
*  I don't think I'm wrong, Mr. President. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Well China has, as of today, 29,000 young men, for the most part, in our country for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=254.88s)]
*  the last three or four months. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=261.36s)]
*  And there's something going on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=263.04s)]
*  Look, there's something going on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=265.0s)]
*  Now hopefully we don't have that problem with China. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=266.36s)]
*  I always had a good relationship with China until the COVID came in. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=269.08s)]
*  That was a step too far. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=272.0s)]
*  We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=273.92s)]
*  No president took in 10 cents, not 10 cents. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=276.44s)]
*  And we, you know, we still got along with them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=279.72s)]
*  But when you look at this, and when you look at other countries, we have a lot coming in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=283.0s)]
*  from Iran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  We have a lot coming in from, you know, places that we're fighting right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Here go the bombs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=290.44s)]
*  You don't have to have bombs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=291.44s)]
*  We had no war. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  It was the first one, 78 years we had no war, other than I defeated ISIS. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  We knocked out ISIS. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=298.0s)]
*  We took out the leading terrorists in the world, both of them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  Took them out, gone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  And now... [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=304.0s)]
*  Baghdadi, Soleimani, the leader of al-Qaeda in Yemen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=305.0s)]
*  Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the worst in the world, worst in the world. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  And you look at it and you look at what's going on with our country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  I'll tell you, you come to Texas, this is now a war zone. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  And they view it as a war zone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  And Mexico's doing nothing to help us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=322.6s)]
*  They're letting the caravans come unimpeded. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they come in by the thousands. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=326.48s)]
*  You have caravans with 25,000 people in them just walking into our country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=329.48s)]
*  So something has to be done. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=334.0s)]
*  The problem you have is Arizona. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  You have a governor, a very liberal governor, that a lot of people say shouldn't be the governor. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=337.04s)]
*  And in California, Newsom's doing a terrible job. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=341.68s)]
*  He's doing... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=344.92s)]
*  I mean, other than talking about how wonderful it is, that's about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=345.92s)]
*  You have an outflow of people, as you know better than anybody. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=349.0s)]
*  I saw your show with him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=351.44s)]
*  I said, you know, this guy's talking about California. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=353.04s)]
*  Millions of people are coming in through California. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=356.0s)]
*  Free healthcare. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=357.8s)]
*  Free healthcare, free education, free everything. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you go to jail, they let you out, they don't turn you over to ICE. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=361.16s)]
*  But not for our veterans. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=364.68s)]
*  For our veterans, they get nothing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=365.88s)]
*  And for people that have been there for a long time and deserve something, citizens, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=367.36s)]
*  they get nothing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=371.84s)]
*  But they get free healthcare. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=372.84s)]
*  If you come in illegally into our country, you get things. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=374.2s)]
*  And this is why they're coming. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=377.56s)]
*  The incentive is so great. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=378.68s)]
*  Our top geopolitical foe, I would argue, is China. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=380.54s)]
*  Russia's not far behind. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=384.12s)]
*  Iran's not far behind. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=385.44s)]
*  Your friend Little Rocket Man, you've got to keep an eye on him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=387.28s)]
*  But China's been allowed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=390.32s)]
*  Chinese nationals have been buying up thousands and thousands of acres of farmland, ranchland, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=392.08s)]
*  and land near our military installations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, you know President Xi. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=399.92s)]
*  If you called him and said, I know somebody, Sean Hannity, would like to buy land, farmland, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=401.76s)]
*  and ranchland in China, do you think he'd allow me? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=407.64s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=410.12s)]
*  They don't allow that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=411.54s)]
*  And they're very possessive of their country. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=412.6s)]
*  They're very possessive of staying sharp and bright and frankly coming into this country [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=415.9s)]
*  and buying a lot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=421.66s)]
*  And you could take it a step further. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=422.66s)]
*  United States Steel, and I'm not trying to equate Japan with China, but it's all still, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=425.02000000000004s)]
*  it's outside and they're coming in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  Japan is buying US Steel. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=433.06s)]
*  US Steel used to be the greatest company in the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=435.06s)]
*  Now, it's a long time ago. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  But I don't like that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=439.62s)]
*  I don't like seeing that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=440.62s)]
*  And part of the reason is because other countries, in particular China, they dump steel into [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  the United States. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=446.54s)]
*  I had that problem taken care of largely because I put big tariffs on the dump steel and I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  saved the steel industry. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=452.76s)]
*  But now they're letting it go. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=454.5s)]
*  And you know, you're not going to have a steel that you want to buy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=455.88s)]
*  You want to build an army tank and you're fighting China. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=457.88s)]
*  You're going to have to get the steel from China. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=460.04s)]
*  And it's I think it's a very dangerous position. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think our country just overall, I don't think our country has ever been in a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=465.72s)]
*  dangerous position like it is right now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=469.16s)]
*  When you look at what's happened with all of this stuff that we're talking about tonight, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=471.68s)]
*  but beyond that, just this total incompetence. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=475.64s)]
*  And it began to a large extent with the election, but it began with Afghanistan. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=478.76s)]
*  When we showed that weakness and that stupidity, taking the military out first, leaving eighty [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=484.24s)]
*  five billion dollars worth of equipment behind, thirteen soldiers killed. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=488.96s)]
*  Nobody ever talks about the 38 that were obliterated. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=492.76s)]
*  They lost their arms, their legs, just obliterated. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=495.52s)]
*  And we left a lot of Americans behind. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=499.06s)]
*  You used to cover that actually. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=500.76s)]
*  You used to give it a countdown how many days. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=501.76s)]
*  I think you stopped doing it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=504.12s)]
*  So long now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=505.32s)]
*  But it's horrible. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=506.32s)]
*  You have Americans over there that I guess you could call them hostages in a sense, but [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=507.32s)]
*  they are over there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  They're trapped behind enemy lines. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=512.92s)]
*  It's a horrible thing that happened. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=513.92s)]
*  So our country and you have Iran getting close to building a nuclear, having a nuclear weapon, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=515.48s)]
*  possibly 35 days. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=521.12s)]
*  The IAEA, I'm not a fan of the UN, but they said that they think they now have weapons [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=522.12s)]
*  grade material to build weapons. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=528.56s)]
*  Would have never happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=531.8s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=533.4s)]
*  I didn't let China. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=534.66s)]
*  I told China, you're not going to buy or you're not going to do business in the United States. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=535.66s)]
*  If you buy no business in the United States. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=539.18s)]
*  I told that to many countries. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=541.74s)]
*  Nobody bought oil from Iran. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=544.18s)]
*  It's all about the oil. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=545.62s)]
*  Nobody bought oil from Iran. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=547.3s)]
*  And they were broke. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  They were acknowledged to be broke. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=550.54s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=551.74s)]
*  They had no money for Hezbollah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=552.74s)]
*  Now they have two hundred and thirty one billion dollars, two hundred and thirty one billion [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=555.2199999999999s)]
*  dollars that they made over the last three years. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=558.74s)]
*  Joe is helping to make the Iranian mullows rich again. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=562.62s)]
*  Well they've they've become very rich. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=565.54s)]
*  The ten billion that he allowed from Iraq. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=567.38s)]
*  They laugh at him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=569.22s)]
*  They laugh at him. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=570.22s)]
*  They think he's the worst. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=571.22s)]
*  Look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=572.22s)]
*  Jimmy Carter is a very happy man now because his presidency is brilliant by comparison [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=574.86s)]

*  Brilliant. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=581.26s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=582.26s)]
*  Speaking of your friend Joe, would have been nice if he came, he would sit with us. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=583.26s)]
*  I'm not sure if he's capable of having a discussion like this. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=589.1s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=592.5s)]
*  I've covered that fairly extensively. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=593.5s)]
*  He shows up today and he didn't really show up at one of the hot spots at the border. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  But I played that tape. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=602.3s)]
*  You know, everybody has children and if the children they get children, they're all going [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=604.66s)]
*  to get in trouble. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=608.98s)]
*  I don't care about what they did so much. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=609.98s)]
*  But if they lie to you, they get in a whole lot of trouble. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=611.7s)]
*  And they've been lying to the American people for three years. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  I played that montage. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=619.3s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=621.02s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=622.06s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=623.06s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=624.06s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=625.06s)]
*  You know, our eyes were not lying to us. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=626.06s)]
*  We've been showing this video, these migrant caravans for three years and now all of a [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=628.1s)]
*  sudden they have changed the narrative. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  This is Republicans' fault? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=634.78s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=636.86s)]
*  It's all disinformation. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=637.86s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=638.86s)]
*  Everything they do. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=641.14s)]
*  And I guess you have to say they're masters at it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=642.9s)]
*  They'll say something a thousand. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=645.26s)]
*  The border is great. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=647.66s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=648.66s)]
*  And they'll say it a thousand different times and some people are going to believe it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=649.9s)]
*  I think that's probably the hardest thing that they've got to do because they have destroyed [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=653.3399999999999s)]
*  this border and they're in the process of destroying our country. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=657.2199999999999s)]
*  We're allowing people in our country that we shouldn't have. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=661.26s)]
*  We are allowing an extraordinarily group, tough group of people into our country. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=663.9s)]
*  When you have prisons and jails and mental institutions being emptied out, not just in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=668.74s)]
*  South America, all over the world, all over the world they're being emptied out. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=676.06s)]
*  You can check your prison population throughout the world and it's all coming into our country. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=679.9399999999999s)]
*  And how can that be good? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=685.66s)]
*  And how can it be good politically? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=687.02s)]
*  Joe Biden is here today. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=689.02s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=690.18s)]
*  And you just saw the other tape and the other tape showed that there are so many of Trump's [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=692.5s)]
*  policies that we reversed. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=698.66s)]
*  I can't even list them. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=700.22s)]
*  It's so long. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=701.9399999999999s)]
*  I gave a short list. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=705.26s)]
*  Why do you think he's here today? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=706.26s)]
*  I don't think it's an accident. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=707.9399999999999s)]
*  And he had bragged about reversing the policies that you put in place. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=710.38s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=715.98s)]
*  Well, I know why he's here because he found out that we were coming. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=716.98s)]
*  We were here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=719.38s)]
*  Look, you and I made this agreement two weeks ago. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=720.38s)]
*  No, actually a month and a half ago. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=723.14s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=725.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=726.5s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=727.5s)]
*  But we made it a while ago and the word got out and a couple of weeks ago it started getting [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=728.5s)]
*  out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=732.1s)]
*  And then they found out for sure. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=733.18s)]
*  You put up the nice little picture on the right hand bottom corner of your television [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=734.9799999999999s)]
*  set that I was coming and all of a sudden they announced that they're coming. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  But they went to the wrong area. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=742.06s)]
*  They went to an area that the governor and myself have done a good job on and there's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=743.2199999999999s)]
*  essentially nobody coming through. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  So you know, you're not seeing it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=749.0999999999999s)]
*  This area is tough. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  So you win in November, the election is on November 5th, about 249 days if I'm right. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=752.14s)]
*  On how do you reverse this? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=761.34s)]
*  Nearly 10 million unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=763.98s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=766.96s)]
*  Many are given court dates seven, eight years down the road. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=768.38s)]
*  They're never showing up for those court dates. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=771.38s)]
*  Now, you've talked about deportation. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=773.22s)]
*  How do we identify them? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  Identify where they are, find them and deport them. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=778.26s)]
*  And is that your promise to the American people? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=781.4200000000001s)]
*  Well absolutely. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=784.26s)]
*  And you have no choice because this is not sustainable. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=785.26s)]
*  The cities are going bad. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=787.26s)]
*  The cities, the country, the whole place is going bad. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=788.94s)]
*  You know, every state is really a border state. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  And I was talking to the governor before and he has done really a great job, Governor Abbott. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=795.58s)]
*  By the way, Ted Cruz wanted to be here but Chuck Schumer kept him back in D.C. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=799.86s)]
*  He's there probably for a good reason, right? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=803.6600000000001s)]
*  Look, we have to deport a lot of people and they have to start immediately. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=806.58s)]
*  People don't know that Dwight Eisenhower, he's a pretty tough president. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  I never thought of it as that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=813.94s)]
*  You start reading and you start really seeing. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=816.34s)]
*  And he was a big deporter. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=818.94s)]
*  And he would deport tremendous numbers of people and they'd bring them just to the other [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=820.82s)]
*  side of the border. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=824.14s)]
*  They'd come back. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=825.14s)]
*  He'd bring them again. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=826.14s)]
*  They'd come back. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=827.14s)]
*  Then he brought them 2,000 miles back and they didn't come back. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=828.14s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=831.3000000000001s)]
*  And the way you do it is your local police. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  We have the greatest police. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=833.86s)]
*  They don't get the respect that they have to get. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=835.26s)]
*  They are treated so badly. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=838.02s)]
*  They do something and they end up losing their pension. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=839.34s)]
*  Even if it's a good thing, if they stop crime nowadays, they lose their pension, their family, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=841.86s)]
*  their house. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=847.54s)]
*  And we're going to give immunity to police and we're going to let the police do the job [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=848.86s)]
*  that they have to do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=851.9s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=852.9s)]
*  They understand who these migrants are. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=853.9s)]
*  They know them by their first name, their last name. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=855.74s)]
*  They know where they come from. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=858.1s)]
*  They know everything about it's going to be the local police are going to turn them over [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  and we're going to have to move them back to their country. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  When the FBI was the world's premier law enforcement agency, and I believe we will achieve that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=865.34s)]
*  again, hopefully. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=870.7s)]
*  You had some of the top FBI officials. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=872.5400000000001s)]
*  They have said what we are witnessing is an invasion of military age men. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=876.7800000000001s)]
*  You ask the question, you try to understand people that think differently than you. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=883.0600000000001s)]
*  For the life of me, I can't come up with any rationale or reason for this. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=887.62s)]
*  So there's two things that you think of. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  Number one, they maybe want the votes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=894.62s)]
*  I think that they're going to get these people registered and to vote and everything else. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=895.7800000000001s)]
*  I'll give you citizenship. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=898.62s)]
*  I hope you remember me at the polls. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=899.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=901.54s)]
*  I'm doing very well with Hispanic and you have a lot of Hispanic coming. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=902.54s)]
*  But the fact is that you have two things. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=906.02s)]
*  Either they're stupid, right, or they hate our country because it can only be basically [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=907.94s)]
*  one of those two things other than the voting element, which I don't know. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=913.6s)]
*  I'm not so sure that they believe that so much. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=917.14s)]
*  I think it's down the road. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=919.78s)]
*  And although they are trying to register people right now as we speak, which who have no idea [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=921.42s)]
*  what they're doing and who don't know this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=926.1s)]
*  In New York City, for example, local elections, illegal immigrants can vote. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=927.86s)]
*  We got to take a break. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=933.22s)]
*  We're just getting started. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  We're at the border. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=935.3000000000001s)]
*  It equals past. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG7SNmaNPdU&t=937.3000000000001s)]
