# The Democrats are going to replace Biden: Tomi Lahren
**Fox News:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g)
*  Here with reaction, Harris poll chair Mark Penn, the host of Tommy Lahren is fearless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no such thing as a fearful Tommy Lahren anyway on out kick Tommy Lahren. Tommy, let's get [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=5.84s)]
*  your take. It's a long list of people now. It's James Carville. I won't speak for Mark Penn. I'll [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=11.76s)]
*  let him speak for himself, but it's Van Jones. It's David Axelrod, it's Maureen Dowd, Nate Silver [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=18.56s)]
*  now joining the chorus. You have been saying, do you still believe 140 days out you think they're [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=25.04s)]
*  going to replace Biden? I absolutely believe they're going to replace Biden. I believe it's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  going to happen either at the convention or shortly thereafter. I think the Democrats are far too [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=38.72s)]
*  strategic and they're far too used to winning and they enjoy winning far too much to take a risk [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=44.24s)]
*  with Joe Biden. And I know they took a risk in 2020, but when we look back at the debates in 2020 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=49.68s)]
*  and we look at when he was newly elected, he was in far better shape then than he is now. And he [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=55.2s)]
*  was slipping then. So I don't think they can possibly take that risk. I do believe they're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=60.64s)]
*  going to swap him out. I also think that when it comes to this first debate, we need to actually [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=65.2s)]
*  raise our expectations of Joe because us counting it as a win, if he's able to sit upright and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=70.0s)]
*  complete a sentence, is giving him far too much credit because then he'll claim a victory just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=75.52s)]
*  like he did after the state of the union because he was able to get through it in one piece. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=80.16s)]
*  So we have to raise our expectations of Biden and we also have to put the onus on the Democrat [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=84.16s)]
*  agenda and not just the messenger, but the actual message because if and when they do swap out Biden, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=88.88s)]
*  we have to be ready on the Republican side and we cannot be caught flat-footed if they bring [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=94.64s)]
*  Gavin Newsom in and he's a shiny new toy. We can't let that happen. The strategy of the Democrats is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=98.8s)]
*  unmatched. Never forget that. I think it would more likely be Whitmer if they have the ability [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=103.76s)]
*  to bypass Vice President Harris. Mark, can anybody really conclude anything else that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=109.2s)]
*  smart Democrats like yourself, you really don't want Biden, do you? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think I'll defer that one per se, but look, I didn't think he was going to run. He [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=122.56s)]
*  decided to run and you know what? He swept the Democratic primaries. These are his delegates. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=129.28s)]
*  It's his convention. The idea that he's not going to be the nominee, I think, is a fantasy. I think [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=135.68s)]
*  the party is around him. I don't know why James said what he said. It's not really particularly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=141.52s)]
*  useful at this point. The only thing I'll say is this debate in June before the convention is a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=147.28s)]
*  little risky. You know why he said it. Well, what's the point of saying that now? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=153.44s)]
*  It's obvious this guy is a mumbling, bumbling, stumbling, fumbling, you know, guy. He could [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=159.84s)]
*  barely string sentences together. However, I do take Tommy's admonition really seriously. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=165.76s)]
*  I think we'll see the return of jacked up Joe. Whatever Joe drank, ate, took before the State of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=172.24s)]
*  the Union, maybe it was just Red Bull and caffeine pills. I don't know. Whatever it was, that was not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=180.8s)]
*  the normal Joe. We never saw it before and we haven't seen it since, but we will see it for the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=187.44s)]
*  debate. Now, there are some even saying, Mark, that Donald Trump might be wise to just pass on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=193.44s)]
*  the first debate, wait till he's nominated, then debate him. What would you say to that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'd say he accepted it. He accepted it in the lion's den. If I were Donald Trump, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=205.52s)]
*  I would have done some better negotiating here, but I don't think he can back out now without [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=211.6s)]
*  really looking cowardly. And I think Biden has said he's going to meet the challenge. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=216.32s)]
*  I think it's a big test. Whether you think he's jacked up or not, if he can get through that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=222.64s)]
*  debate, he'll lift his campaign. And if he can't, I suspect it might actually be in some jeopardy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=227.6s)]
*  They might have actually, Joe might have done Donald Trump a favor. And I say this affectionately, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=234.48s)]
*  Tommy, by insisting that when it's not his turn to speak, that they mute his microphone, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  because I think that was a mistake in the first debate in 2020. Your reaction. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=245.04s)]
*  Well, I would hope a lot of things for that first debate. Obviously, it's stacked against Donald [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=250.88s)]
*  Trump and we know that, but I think Donald Trump has an incredible opportunity in this first debate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=255.2s)]
*  to act more presidential than he's ever acted in his entire life. Push everything on Joe and Joe's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=259.84s)]
*  failing agenda and his failed policies, which is the Democrat failed policies and agenda. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=264.88s)]
*  If Donald Trump just sits back and he lets Joe talk himself into a corner, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=269.84s)]
*  then Donald Trump will win that first debate. He just has to restrain himself, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=274.4s)]
*  which I believe he can do, pull it in, act as presidential and dignified as possible, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=278.0s)]
*  and he will win against Joe Biden and his failed policies. He simply can't stand on those. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And quite frankly, he can't stand at all. All right. Let me ask you this. If in fact, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe, for whatever reason, Mark Penn went out, Tommy's convinced it would be Gavin Newsom. I'm [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=292.96s)]
*  not sure. I don't think it would be Gavin. That's just my guess. I have no inside knowledge, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=299.2s)]
*  except that he told me over and over and over and over again when I interviewed him and in the debate [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=305.52s)]
*  with Governor DeSantis that he wouldn't do it. OK, so I think the most likely person, if it's not [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=310.32s)]
*  Vice President Harris, would be Governor Whitmer. That's my take. People have floated the name of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=317.2s)]
*  Michelle Obama. I don't think she's up to the job myself. Who would be the most likely Democrat? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=324.32s)]
*  Who would you pick if you had to choose somebody? Well, again, you have to go through the history [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=329.76s)]
*  here. These delegates were nominated for this ticket. Harris, I think, would be the likely [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=337.68s)]
*  nominee if for some reason, any reason, Joe Biden had to remove himself. You could bet on that as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=344.08s)]
*  almost a certainty. You think it would be Kamala Harris? Yes, absolutely. All right. Well, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=350.8s)]
*  bet the games on. I don't know what you guys want to bet, but, you know, feel free, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=359.04s)]
*  off air. Thank you both. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4lJj9Do94g&t=364.72s)]
