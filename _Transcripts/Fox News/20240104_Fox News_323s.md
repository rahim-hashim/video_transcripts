# FLASHBACK: The Daily Show 'begs' Hannity to stay in New York
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw)
*  All right, as I announced yesterday, I have officially left New York State for good, not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=0.0s)]
*  going back. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=8.6s)]
*  I'm now a full-time resident in the free state of Florida, something frankly I've wanted [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=9.6s)]
*  to do for years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=13.14s)]
*  And back in 2014, when I first floated the idea, well, Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=14.9s)]
*  well, he enlisted the likes of Nathan Lane and the Jersey Boys. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=20.94s)]
*  I took it as a great compliment. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=24.36s)]
*  And they actually wrote a song for me, begging me to stay. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=26.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=30.18s)]
*  Sean, we know you're mad at us, and you have every right to be. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=31.18s)]
*  Occupy Wall Street, Governor Cuomo, that weird smell. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=35.34s)]
*  New York has made a lot of big mistakes, but we're going to change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=39.02s)]
*  Just please, stay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=42.540000000000006s)]
*  Stay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=43.540000000000006s)]

*  Yo, Sean, man, you can't leave. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  We need you, dog. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=49.540000000000006s)]

*  We're in love. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=65.14s)]

*  He himself did not excuse Reaction Switch. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=165.54s)]
*  Didn't let him excuse him or she, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=168.54s)]
*  but he did not wait for a), [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=169.78s)]
*  He is always yours. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=170.94s)]
*  Unleashing this right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=172.54s)]
*  brand new show. We get to announce it right here. Fox News Saturday night with Jimmy Fela. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=174.54s)]
*  And it premieres January 13th. We're proud of you. You're staying. I'm left. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=181.06s)]
*  Yeah. By the way, Hannity, you find out I get a show, you move out of the state the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=185.62s)]
*  next day. What's up with that, man? What's up with that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=191.5s)]
*  It was just bad timing. I had no idea. But I'm proud of you. We're happy for you. You [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=195.82s)]
*  deserve it. You're an amazing talent. I try to do a little of what you do. You've seen [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=200.78s)]
*  me do it. I'll never be as good, but I admire what you do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=206.94s)]
*  Well, listen, I love you. And you know this wouldn't be possible without you. Everyone's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=210.54s)]
*  been asking me what your cut's going to be. They're like, how much does Sean want? Is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  this like the soprano's? Does Sean get to wet his beak like on the sopranos? But anyway, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=219.22s)]
*  Hannity, okay? You've been in Florida 48 hours and you haven't cut the sleeves off your jacket [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=226.78s)]
*  yet. Are you sure you're a real Floridian? And how come there's no plastic on that chair? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=232.78s)]
*  You haven't even plasticed the chair. Well, I brought my old chair with me. One [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=238.7s)]
*  thing I took from New York. But by the way, I mean, I actually, I think Jon Stewart, I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=244.06s)]
*  thought he was really funny. Even when he did make fun of me, I was blown away by that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=250.86s)]
*  production. It might have kept me in New York longer than I wanted to stay. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  I have two points. One, I legitimately did think that was a good video because the Stewart [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=260.66s)]
*  Daily Show had a lot of funny elements to it. The modern Daily Show, as you know, tickets [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=266.5s)]
*  are $10 to get in and a hundred to get out. It's not the best show. Okay? But Sean, you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=271.82s)]
*  should be concerned that the Daily Show made a bigger effort to keep you than we did. Okay? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=277.98s)]
*  We love you, but we did not make that video. I mean, I would have made that video for your [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=284.06s)]
*  staff because I love your staff and I love their families. But I feel like we owe you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=288.98s)]
*  that video, Sean. Fox has been great. I have no complaints. If you would have bet 1996, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=293.42s)]
*  I'd be one of the last people standing. That was a bad bet. Congratulations. Saturday night, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=301.42s)]
*  10 o'clock. We'll be watching. Jimmy Fallah. Thank you, sir. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUD_oZRr0aw&t=307.78s)]
