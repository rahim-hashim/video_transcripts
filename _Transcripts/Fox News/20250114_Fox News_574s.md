# Sean Hannity: The very first confirmation hearing of the new Trump era is in the books
**Fox News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY)
*  Welcome to Hannity, a huge day on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=0.0s)]
*  The very first confirmation hearing of the new Trump era is now in the books, and the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=4.5s)]
*  president-elect's pick for defense secretary, our friend, former colleague Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=9.16s)]
*  did a phenomenal job. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=13.96s)]
*  He dominated the room, made Senate Democrats look foolish, petty, unprofessional, desperate, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  and he did it with dignity and grace. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=22.72s)]
*  Now, the same cannot be said for the minority party in the U.S. Senate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=25.0s)]
*  As I predicted, I told you they would revert to form, revert to their default position, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=29.28s)]
*  which is to smear, slander, besmirch, attack, and frankly, waste everybody's time. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=35.24s)]
*  While they should have been asking questions about, let's see, hypersonic missile technology, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=40.68s)]
*  the gap of vulnerability in our military, the next generation of warfare, future wars [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=46.84s)]
*  will be fought in air-conditioned offices, not on battlefields. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=52.28s)]
*  While they should have been concerned about Donald Trump's idea for an iron dome and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=56.24s)]
*  military dominance, they were not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Instead, these senators, they just attempted the predictable, let's bork him, let's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=63.84s)]
*  do to Pete what they did to Clarence Thomas, let's calving off Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=68.88s)]
*  Identity politics, awoke military, DEI, their top concern. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=73.88s)]
*  There were almost no questions about Pete Hegseth's qualifications, his real vision, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  his real achievements, nothing about his military deployments, for the most part, to Iraq, Afghanistan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=84.88s)]
*  He had several Democratic senators screaming and shouting and putting on a show, all while [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=91.48s)]
*  pushing these personal attacks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=96.84s)]
*  But got to give the worst performance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  That belonged to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine of all people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=102.84s)]
*  I found it actually comical. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=106.12s)]
*  His line of questioning today, well, in one way it was creepy, it was beyond unprofessional, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=108.48s)]
*  degrading, hypocritical, but not just to Pete, his entire family. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=113.76s)]
*  That was sad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  That was the sad part of it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, Kaine evoked Hegseth's young daughter and wife, even brought up Hegseth's wedding [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=122.0s)]
*  vows. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=126.2s)]
*  Kaine's behavior today was disgraceful beneath the office that he supposedly serves, but [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=127.2s)]
*  it was also so hypocritical. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=132.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at your screen, shall we? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=135.08s)]
*  This was Tim Kaine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=137.34s)]
*  He was Hillary Clinton's running mate when they lost in 2016. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=138.84s)]
*  And here is Tim Kaine, take a look right there, gazing lovingly into Bill Clinton's eyes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=142.82s)]
*  And here he is next to Clinton with a creepy grin from ear to ear, you know, and a big [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=149.22s)]
*  thumbs up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=154.44s)]
*  Did he ever ask Bill Clinton about the rape allegation of Juanita Broderick or Bill Clinton [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=155.44s)]
*  to Paula Jones or his relationship with Monica Lewinsky or the sexual assault allegations [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=163.86s)]
*  by Kathleen Willey? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=171.18s)]
*  No, I don't think he ever did. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=172.86s)]
*  He was perfectly fine never bringing up real allegations of Bill Clinton, rape, sexual [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=175.94000000000003s)]
*  assault, exposing himself, having sex with an intern, and frankly the Democrats picked [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=180.78000000000003s)]
*  the perfect guy to drown themselves in hypocrisy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  In fact, just see if you can spot the difference between Kaine's rhetoric surrounding Clinton [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=190.18s)]
*  versus his questioning today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=195.94s)]
*  It's not easy to, it's not hard to pick up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=197.66s)]
*  You'll like this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=199.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=200.86s)]
*  So you think you are completely cleared because you committed no crime. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=201.86s)]
*  That's your definition of cleared. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=204.9s)]
*  You had just fathered a child two months before by a woman that was not your wife. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  I am shocked that you would stand here and say you're completely cleared. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=211.46s)]
*  Everything you said back in I think 2002 about former President Bill Clinton that he should [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=216.28s)]
*  resign if the scandal, the Lewinsky scandal turned out to be true, you still hold true [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=220.32s)]
*  to those words you said back then? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=224.58s)]
*  I had some feelings of disappointment back then, but you know, and that's now 20 years [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=226.6s)]
*  old. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=230.88s)]
*  Past controversies aren't that important to me now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=231.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, do you think your feelings have changed? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=233.8s)]
*  It was a feeling I had at the time, but now I'm thinking about what do we do to help this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=236.96s)]
*  country be strong? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=240.66s)]
*  And so past controversies don't have anything to do with that question. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=243.24s)]
*  Tim Kaine, loser, always has been, always will be, classless, self-important career [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=248.72s)]
*  politician with few actual real achievements. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, he was serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and Gitmo. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=258.44s)]
*  Tim Kaine, he was running for office over and over and over again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=262.64s)]
*  He's the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the Washington swamp, but he's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=267.16s)]
*  not alone. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  He's with many Democratic senators, they disgraced themselves. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=273.52s)]
*  At one point, Elizabeth Warren almost got laughed out of the room. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=279.52s)]
*  Will you put your money where your mouth is and agree that when you leave this job you [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=280.52s)]
*  will not work for the defense industry for 10 years? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=286.14s)]
*  Senator, it's not even a question I've thought about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=289.46s)]
*  You can think about it right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=291.78s)]
*  It's not one, my motivation for this job has never been about what could conceivably [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=294.28s)]
*  come next. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=299.96s)]
*  Time is short. I just need a yes or no. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=300.96s)]
*  I would consult with the president about what the policy should be in the Defense Department. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  In other words, you're quite sure that every general who serves should not go directly [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  into the defense industry for 10 years, but you're not willing to make that same pledge? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm not a general, Senator. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=319.0s)]
*  You've got to admit, it's such a waste of time, a colossal waste of time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Senator Gillibrand, New York, also looking foolish today after accidentally exposing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=329.12s)]
*  a real problem with the U.S. military caused by her party. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=338.04s)]
*  The statements you said about people who have views differently than you, that we're the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  enemy, are you saying that 50 percent of the DOD, if they hold liberal views or leftist [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  views or are Democrats, are not welcoming the military? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=350.0s)]
*  Are you saying that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=354.16s)]
*  Senator, I volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan under Democrat President Barack Obama. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=355.74s)]
*  I also volunteered to guard the inauguration of Joe Biden, but was denied the opportunity [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=360.84s)]
*  to serve because I was identified as an extremist by my own unit for a Christian tattoo. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=365.88s)]
*  Oh, the vapors. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=371.52s)]
*  Faint selective outrage, as usual. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=373.76s)]
*  To recap, Democrats attacked Pete Hegseth, not for being a Democrat. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=376.7s)]
*  They attacked him for having a tattoo of a cross. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=381.68s)]
*  He believes in Jesus, and he mentioned his personal Lord and Savior. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=384.96s)]
*  Oh, the thought of it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=389.23999999999995s)]
*  They attacked him over his personal life, even suggested he was an alcoholic. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=391.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=395.88s)]
*  He might have had drinks at social functions like most people. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=396.88s)]
*  No one on Capitol Hill would ever do that, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=400.52s)]
*  Because today, Mark Wayne Mullen, oh, look at this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=403.32s)]
*  That looks like a little bar, a little party. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  Chuckie's pulling out the beer. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=408.76s)]
*  Is that Tim Kaine and Kristen Gillibrand? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=410.44s)]
*  Anyway, Mullen exposed that incredible display of hypocrisy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=414.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=417.4s)]
*  The senator from Virginia starts bringing up the fact that what if you showed up drunk [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=418.6s)]
*  to your job? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=422.64s)]
*  How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=424.48s)]
*  Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign from their job? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=430.28s)]
*  And don't tell me you haven't seen it, because I know you have. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=434.76s)]
*  And then how many senators do you know have got a divorce before cheating on their wives? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=437.4s)]
*  Did you ask them to step down? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=442.88s)]
*  No. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=445.6s)]
*  But it's for show. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=447.24s)]
*  You guys, make sure you make a big show and point out the hypocrisy, because a man's made [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=448.68s)]
*  a mistake. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=453.48s)]
*  And you want to sit there and say that he's not qualified? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=455.4s)]
*  Give me a joke. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWzZ-eEUAY&t=458.44s)]
