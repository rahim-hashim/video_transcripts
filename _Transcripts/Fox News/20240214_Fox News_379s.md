# Lara Trump: Nikki Haley is poised to lose in a 'very embarrassing way'
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=0.0s)]
*  We are only two weeks away from the South Carolina Republican primary, and the latest [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=3.68s)]
*  CBS poll has President Trump leading Nikki Haley by 35 percent in her home state. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=8.0s)]
*  So with President Trump closing in on the GOP presidential nomination, the former president [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=13.94s)]
*  is looking to shore up the RNC ahead of the general election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=19.06s)]
*  Now, yesterday, the president endorsed North Carolina GOP chair, a guy by the name of Michael [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Wotley, to replace Ronald McDaniel for RNC chair, along with his daughter-in-law, Laura [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Trump, for co-chair. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=32.68s)]
*  Laura joins us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  She's the host of the Right View podcast, which I don't know how you're going to pull [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=35.28s)]
*  it all off, but it's great to have you back, Laura. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=40.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=42.44s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=43.44s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=44.44s)]
*  First, let me get your reaction. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=46.44s)]
*  I was a little surprised. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=48.36s)]
*  I wasn't surprised by Mitt Romney's comments. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=49.36s)]
*  I wasn't surprised by Biden's comments. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  You know, if you don't support the Ukraine bill and you believe in securing our borders [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  first, that means you're pro-Putin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  But I was surprised at Nikki Haley's comments. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  That did surprise me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=65.3s)]
*  I've not been a strong critic of her. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=66.3s)]
*  I think she's a nice person. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=67.96s)]
*  But if she wants to win the nomination, I'm not sure, you know, saying, you know, putting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=71.4s)]
*  Ukraine ahead of American border security is a good idea or claiming that if you support [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=76.4s)]
*  that, that somehow you're siding with the thug Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=82.0s)]
*  Nobody's siding with the thug dictator murderer Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=85.48s)]
*  Yeah, we want to protect our country first and foremost, Sean. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=89.6s)]
*  I mean, everybody knows that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=93.2s)]
*  I think everyone understands that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=94.72s)]
*  The fact that we're even talking about Nikki Haley at this point right now is kind of insane. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=95.92s)]
*  I mean, the fact that she is still running for president supposedly is a bit outrageous. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=100.36s)]
*  I assume she would only say something like this to maybe garner a little bit of media [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=106.64s)]
*  attention. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=110.52s)]
*  She is poised right now, Sean, as you just mentioned, to lose her home state of South [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=111.8s)]
*  Carolina in a very embarrassing way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=117.56s)]
*  Maybe it's not quite as embarrassing as losing to none of these candidates, which just happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=120.52s)]
*  in Nevada. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=126.5s)]
*  But it's time for us to all garner our support behind the obvious Republican nominee Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=128.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=134.72s)]
*  We have a must-win election on our hands right now against Joe Biden. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=135.72s)]
*  Let's face it, Sean, if we wait and do nothing and allow Joe Biden another four years and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=139.88s)]
*  Democrats another four years to destroy this country, that's exactly what is going to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=144.88s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=150.48s)]
*  We will not have a country left. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=151.48s)]
*  Why Nikki Haley is still in this and why she says things that are so ridiculous and outrageous, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=153.0s)]
*  I wish I could tell you, but it makes absolutely no sense, Sean. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  So here's what I see, that the Republican National Committee is finally beginning to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=161.84s)]
*  get right and there's one part of the puzzle that's missing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=166.4s)]
*  Now, just as a predicate, let me add that if I had my way, Election Day would be one [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  day, it would be a national holiday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=175.48s)]
*  You would make exceptions for the military, the infirm, the elderly, that they could vote [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  by mail. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  I'd have voter ID, signature verification, chain of custody controls, updated voter rolls [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  and partisan observers watching the voting all day in every precinct around the country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=188.04s)]
*  and the vote counting all night. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  That's not the system we have. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=196.44s)]
*  We got to deal with the Hamwheel dealt and the Hamwheel we are dealt is such that a lot [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=197.98s)]
*  of states have voting, it's seemingly in perpetuity, weeks on end. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=203.5s)]
*  I don't particularly like it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=207.5s)]
*  I think it lends itself to integrity issues. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  But the Republicans, Republicans and conservatives around the country have been reluctant and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=211.92s)]
*  resistant to voting early and voting by mail. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=216.98s)]
*  And I think they better overcome that resistance or they're going to start out election night [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  down three or 400,000 votes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=225.38s)]
*  The other part of the puzzle, and the RNC, by the way, did say bank your vote. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=227.66s)]
*  They came out with a campaign. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=231.62s)]
*  I support it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=232.74s)]
*  But they haven't really seemed to have dealt with the issue of legal ballot harvesting, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=233.96s)]
*  which I think the Democrats have pretty much mastered. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=238.14s)]
*  Surprising it's legal, but it is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=240.9s)]
*  And if Republicans don't match or surpass the efforts of Democrats, especially in swing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=243.42s)]
*  states, that is a vulnerability that I believe, you know, could sway an election. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=248.22s)]
*  If six states and a couple of hundred thousand votes make all the difference, that could [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=252.82s)]
*  be the difference. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=256.82s)]
*  Will that be a top priority? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=258.5s)]
*  Well, absolutely, Sean. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=260.18s)]
*  I mean, we have to be six or seven steps ahead of the Democrats. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=262.46s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=266.74s)]
*  We have to beat them at this game. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=267.74s)]
*  We thought as Republicans we could play the game we always have. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=269.38s)]
*  And that just isn't the case anymore. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=272.94s)]
*  As you just explained, we have to deal with what we have right now in this moment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=275.02s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, the RNC should have one goal and one focus. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=279.82s)]
*  And that is ensuring that the leader of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump, is elected [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=284.38s)]
*  as the 47th president of the United States and we are able to save this country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Here's what I can assure you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=295.02s)]
*  Any person walking into the doors of the RNC with any other goal in mind will be shown [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=296.86s)]
*  the door if I were elected to this position as coach chair of the RNC. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=303.02s)]
*  We have no time to waste. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=308.5s)]
*  We have nine and a half months. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=309.78s)]
*  We have to ensure that every single penny raised goes to voter registration, as you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=311.62s)]
*  just said, legal ballot harvesting, which we have been beaten by the Democrats at forever [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=318.1s)]
*  at this point, game day operations. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=322.86s)]
*  We need to understand on election day where we are in every single precinct around this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=326.08s)]
*  country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=331.18s)]
*  We need a ground game that is unmatched. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=332.18s)]
*  And we need to have the most lethal fighting machine in the American political history [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=334.72s)]
*  you have ever seen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  That happens day one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=342.14s)]
*  If I'm elected coach chair of the RNC, I can assure you we have no time to waste. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=343.62s)]
*  We better get started today. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=348.46s)]
*  Listen, I like your passion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  I like your ideas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=352.14s)]
*  Dealing with those two issues to me are critical ahead of the next election. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=353.38s)]
*  I don't know, though, whether to congratulate you or to offer condolences because I think [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  that's one tough job. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=361.74s)]
*  But we appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll follow up closely. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqptGJ426M&t=365.38s)]
