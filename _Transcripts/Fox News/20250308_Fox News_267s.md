# Does Gavin Newsom want to be president?
**Fox News:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8)
*  Turning Point founder, CEO Charlie Kirk. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=0.0s)]
*  Charlie, great to have you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  So last night, I knew you were on the show tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=4.28s)]
*  I tuned in and I was listening to the podcast. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=7.66s)]
*  And I didn't get through all of it, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=11.3s)]
*  but first of all, you were very gracious. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=13.24s)]
*  You were very nice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=15.84s)]
*  You could have gone at him really, really hard. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=16.72s)]
*  You did it in a really nice way. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=19.04s)]
*  And I know Gavin too well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=21.48s)]
*  I've interviewed Gavin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=25.28s)]
*  I moderated, I think you brought it up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=26.68s)]
*  I moderated the debate with DeSantis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=28.8s)]
*  And I have tried to reason with this man, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=31.32s)]
*  and he does not listen, ever. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=34.52s)]
*  Maybe, is this a tipping point for him? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=37.6s)]
*  Did you get the feeling he really wants to change? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=39.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=44.52s)]
*  I think he wants to be president, Sean, more than [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  anything else on the planet. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=47.36s)]
*  I think you can agree he has more political ambition [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=48.68s)]
*  than almost anybody in the Democrat Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  And I think he understands that the entire country is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=53.0s)]
*  moving center right and is accelerating at a rapid pace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=55.64s)]
*  In fact, we are course correcting after four failed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=59.56s)]
*  years under Joe Biden and all of the woke stuff [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=62.0s)]
*  and the anti-common sense movement. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=64.68s)]
*  Gavin Newsom had me on his podcast, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=66.8s)]
*  and I was shocked all of a sudden where he decided [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=68.48s)]
*  to diverge away from the orthodox opinion [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=71.12s)]
*  in the Democrat Party, which is as simple as saying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=74.6s)]
*  that it's not fair that a biological man can compete [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=77.2s)]
*  in female sports. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=81.4s)]
*  Now, number one, I don't believe that he actually [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=82.76s)]
*  has any heartfelt beliefs in this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=84.8s)]
*  I think it's purely political transactional. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=86.24s)]
*  However, everybody in the audience should understand. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=88.96s)]
*  This means that we are winning at such a rapid pace [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=91.32s)]
*  that the governor of the largest state in the country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=94.96s)]
*  the largest Democrat state, who obviously wants [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  to be president, has to adjust his policies [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=99.92s)]
*  against the base of the party to even be taken seriously [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=102.64s)]
*  to run for president in 2028. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=106.16s)]
*  OK, but the problem is it's so transparently [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=108.8s)]
*  about political expediency. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=111.92s)]
*  I don't believe he's gonna change his core beliefs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=113.8s)]
*  And here would be the biggest problem [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=115.52s)]
*  that I would see that he has. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=117.2s)]
*  He has something called a track record. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=118.84s)]
*  He's been in government. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=120.92s)]
*  He's the mayor of San Francisco, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=122.48s)]
*  lieutenant governor for eight years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=124.12s)]
*  At the end of this term, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=125.96s)]
*  he'll have been governor for eight years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  He has a track record. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=128.96s)]
*  So I don't think you get to run away [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=130.48s)]
*  from the positions you have been holding for decades, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=132.4s)]
*  just by talking to conservatives like Charlie Kirk. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=137.64s)]
*  He never invited me on the podcast. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=141.04s)]
*  I'm offended by the way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=142.88s)]
*  I'm very offended. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=144.28s)]
*  I feel left out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=145.12s)]
*  You should text Gavin. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=147.6s)]
*  And secondly, you're exactly right, Sean. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a moment of podcast. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=151.2s)]
*  Before you went on, I can't stand him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=152.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, there was a moment of podcast. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=152.88s)]
*  And look, there was this back and forth [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  where I drilled him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=157.24s)]
*  I said, look, you have the highest cost [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=158.16s)]
*  of living in California. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=159.32s)]
*  You have the most homelessness [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  in the country in California. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=161.56s)]
*  You have the highest poverty rate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=163.12s)]
*  in the country in California. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=165.04s)]
*  You have the second highest home prices in the country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=166.32s)]
*  You guys control the House, the Senate, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=168.76s)]
*  the governor's mansion, lieutenant governor's mansion, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=170.88s)]
*  the secretary of state and attorney general, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=172.64s)]
*  and every statewide elected office for the last 20 years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=174.04s)]
*  How is this Republicans fault? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  What record are you gonna run on? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And you could, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=179.76s)]
*  every time there's anything California specific, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=180.6s)]
*  you know this from moderating [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  the wonderful DeSantis debate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  He gets hyper aggressive [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=185.55999999999997s)]
*  and focuses on one little minute detail. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  And he just tries to bring you down into the ditch. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  But everyone has been voting with their feet [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to California over the last couple of years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=193.04s)]
*  They have net population loss. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  People are leaving in record numbers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=197.27999999999997s)]
*  They also had the highest gas prices, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  unnecessarily highest gas tax. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=200.96s)]
*  And so look, there's nothing to run on [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=203.0s)]
*  except for the fact that he is very slippery and slick [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  and he's trying to reinvent and rebrand himself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  And look, I'll talk to anybody at any time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=211.08s)]
*  There was a whole part too, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=212.68s)]
*  where I even got him to tacitly admit [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=214.12s)]
*  that President Trump is unlike any other cultural phenomenon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=216.16s)]
*  we've ever seen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=219.32s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=220.16s)]
*  I went to the Oval Office of President Trump [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=221.0s)]
*  and I had a great time with him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  I said, well, are you gonna work with President Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  with ICE and immigration and border patrol? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=225.44s)]
*  And of course he had a slick answer to that as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=227.32s)]
*  But I think there is a looming Democrat Civil War happening [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=229.64s)]
*  because Gavin Newsom is realizing that if he does not come [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=232.44s)]
*  to the middle on a lot of issues [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=236.0s)]
*  and magify some of his positions, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=237.32s)]
*  there will be no chance for him in a general election. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=239.4s)]
*  But President Trump has completely remade [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=241.68s)]
*  the American body politic. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=243.76s)]
*  And you can start to see [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=245.4s)]
*  the most opportunistic Democrat of them all, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=246.32s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, at least attempting to adjust [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=248.72s)]
*  with some of his rhetoric. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll see if his actions follow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=252.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=254.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP6ESutfwR8&t=259.6s)]
