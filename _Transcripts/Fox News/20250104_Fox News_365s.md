# A crime was committed in the Trump courtroom, GOP lawmaker says
**Fox News:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI)
*  Is the brand new United States senator from Ohio just sworn in earlier today, Bernie Moreno? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=0.0s)]
*  Congratulations, Senator. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=6.46s)]
*  We can officially call you that now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=9.4s)]
*  What's it feel like? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=11.84s)]
*  You raise your hand, you get sworn in as a senator. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=12.84s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  What did you tell your wife and your family and your in-laws and everybody else that they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=16.12s)]
*  believe that you're now a senator? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, the good news is I have a big Catholic family, so they all came to Washington, D.C., [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=21.72s)]
*  to be part of this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=27.28s)]
*  You know, it's a little overwhelming. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=28.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm a kid born in Columbia, South America, blessed to death by this country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=29.64s)]
*  I got the ability to build great businesses here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=34.88s)]
*  And this is my time now to give back to this country that I love and eager to get to work [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  to get stuff done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=42.38s)]
*  Well, congratulations to you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  It's quite a moment in anybody's history. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=47.28s)]
*  The task is big. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=50.0s)]
*  I've seen your committee assignments. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=51.0s)]
*  I want to follow up on the law fair that's out there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=53.16s)]
*  You know, there's this prevailing feeling, I think, across the country that justice is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=56.24s)]
*  not applied equally, that somehow if you're a conservative or Republican or have the name [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=59.68s)]
*  Trump, that you're just not going to get the same sort of treatment as somebody on [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=65.2s)]
*  the other side of the aisle. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=69.2s)]
*  What can you do as a senator to help even that playing field and restore justice and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=70.88s)]
*  confidence in our justice system? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=75.08s)]
*  Well, Jason, as you know, what makes America unique and a great country is that we have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  a justice system that works. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  When we see what's happened over the last four years with the law fair, the weaponization [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=84.92s)]
*  of the justice system, the attacks of political opponents, President Trump, of course, namely [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=88.72s)]
*  number one, the crime that was committed was a crime in that courtroom. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=93.56s)]
*  Judge Barchand is a total absolute disgrace to the American legal system. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  What we have to do in the Senate right now is get every single one of President Trump's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=104.28s)]
*  nominees confirmed. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=109.72s)]
*  We've got to get Pam Bondi in there, Cash Patel in there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=110.72s)]
*  We've got to make certain that they are allowed to do the job to restore the confidence of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=113.8s)]
*  the American people in our legal system, because without that confidence, we can't go forward [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=118.72s)]
*  as a country in a meaningful way, the way we've been able to be so successful and a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=123.56s)]
*  shining light of liberty to the rest of the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=127.96s)]
*  People in Colombia look to places like America as the example, but when you see ridiculous, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=130.44s)]
*  idiotic judges like Barchand, it's a disgrace to this country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=136.16s)]
*  It's an embarrassment to this country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=140.04s)]
*  We've got to get these guys out of office. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  One of the committees that you're assigned to is the Homeland Security Committee, and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  we had some dramatic happenings, both in New Orleans and then in Las Vegas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  We've also had Secretary Mayorkas for a long period of time, I think, deceiving the American [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=155.72s)]
*  people by claiming that they had operational control of the budget or the border and that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=160.48s)]
*  they had control of it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think any of that is true. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  What are the early plans for Homeland Security to try to clean up a department and agency [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=170.04s)]
*  that includes FEMA, it includes the Secret Service, it includes the TSA, it includes [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=174.68s)]
*  so many different departments and agencies, including all the different things, the different [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=181.56s)]
*  avenues of border? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=186.56s)]
*  What can you do from a Homeland Security standpoint? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  The first thing I do is we've got to get Chrissy Noem in there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=192.84s)]
*  We've got to get, again, Trump's nominees in there confirmed quickly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=195.38s)]
*  We've got to get them in there by January 20th. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=199.14s)]
*  They should be ready to go so that when President Trump's inaugurated, we have a full cabinet [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=201.1s)]
*  in place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=206.61999999999998s)]
*  That's the job of the United States Senate for the next two weeks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  Then what they've got to do is they've got to go in deep into these organizations and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  reform them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  Now, what we have to do is, through legislation, stop these loopholes like asylum that allow [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  people to cross the border illegally and then raise their hand and claim asylum. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  ridiculous legislation that exists. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=226.78s)]
*  Make it very simple. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=229.86s)]
*  If you come into this country illegally, you're not caught and released into the interior [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=230.94s)]
*  of the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  You're immediately returned to the country where you came, and you're never allowed [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  to claim asylum for the rest of your life. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=241.82s)]
*  Look, we have to make it so that you can come here legally and zero tolerance for illegal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=243.78s)]
*  immigration. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=248.3s)]
*  And if you're in this country illegally, you're going to be deported very, very soon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=249.34s)]
*  We should make the plans before we're forced to get you out of this country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=254.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think President Trump has a great opportunity to reset the standard for credible [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=259.64s)]
*  fear and enforce the law. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=265.32s)]
*  If you don't come in through a port of entry, guess what? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=267.0s)]
*  We're going to detain you and deport you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=269.24s)]
*  That is the current law. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=270.82s)]
*  Last question here, Senator. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=273.24s)]
*  You were just elected from the great state of Ohio. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=274.24s)]
*  Great expectations. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=278.24s)]
*  When you look back five, six years from now, how should the people of Ohio and the people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=279.36s)]
*  of the United States are going to look at you? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=284.64s)]
*  What would be a success in your mind? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=286.56s)]
*  What do you need to achieve during those six years that you've been granted this opportunity [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  to serve as a senator? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=292.56s)]
*  Well, I think we have to complete the promises that we made in the campaign campaign trail. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=294.76s)]
*  We have to have a secure border, a zero tolerance for illegal immigration, only one path into [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=299.06s)]
*  America a legal way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=303.96s)]
*  We got to lower the cost of everyday living. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=305.64s)]
*  We have to re-industrialize this country, especially in the automobile industry, where [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  we've gutted our middle class, gutted our auto factories, shipped them to Canada and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=313.28s)]
*  Mexico, reverse course, shrink the size and scale of the federal government, get our budget [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=317.67999999999995s)]
*  under control, make sure we have peace and stability around the world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=322.96s)]
*  And Jason, we do too much here in D.C. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  Get stuff out of Washington, D.C., back to the states. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=329.08s)]
*  If we can do that over the next six years, I think the Republican Party can be the party [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=332.11999999999995s)]
*  for generations to come. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  We have an opportunity. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=339.26s)]
*  We don't have six years, though. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=340.26s)]
*  We have 18 months to get these things done, and I'm confident that we can do it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=341.68s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=348.72s)]
*  I can tell why you're the senator. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=349.72s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFScl2PTXEI&t=351.72s)]
