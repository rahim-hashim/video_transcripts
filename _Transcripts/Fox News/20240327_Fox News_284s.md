# Sean Hannity: RFK, Jr. has Biden worried
**Fox News:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0)
*  In fact, Biden's press secretary doesn't even want to answer even the obvious questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=0.0s)]
*  Some would consider tough. I don't think it's that tough. The question that everybody has [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=6.72s)]
*  on their mind, the question that polls are showing that a vast majority of Americans [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=11.28s)]
*  agree with, and that has to do with her boss's cognitive decline. Watch this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=16.5s)]
*  When I told a number of people that I was talking to you today, it was interesting, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  they all said, would you please just ask her, does the president have dementia? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=26.24s)]
*  So before I move on from that, does he? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=31.84s)]
*  But Mark, Mark, I can't even believe you're asking me this question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=33.68s)]
*  That is an incredibly offensive question to ask. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=37.6s)]
*  But you know people ask it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=40.32s)]
*  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mark, you're taking us down this rabbit hole. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=42.0s)]
*  I'm not even going to truly, truly, really, you know, take the premise of your question. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=48.080000000000005s)]
*  I think it is incredibly insulting. And so we can, you know, we can move on to the next question. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=56.32000000000001s)]
*  Gas prices and grocery prices, then big topics here in North Carolina. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  How does Mr. Biden win votes when people don't have as much disposable income? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=67.36s)]
*  Look, the president understands all the important groceries. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=72.72s)]
*  Those costs have gone down because of what this president has been able to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=76.4s)]
*  And with that, thank you so much, Mark. Have an amazing, amazing day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=80.8s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=85.84s)]
*  She hung up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=87.44s)]
*  Offensive, insulting, grocery prices are down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=89.68s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre, she needs to go shopping. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=93.68s)]
*  The writing is on the wall, anxiety running high. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=96.4s)]
*  And while Democrats panic, the president does nothing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=99.68s)]
*  Today, no scheduled events at all whatsoever. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=103.2s)]
*  Now, President Trump, meanwhile, just accepted an invitation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=106.64s)]
*  He will attend the wake for NYPD officer Jonathan Diller. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=109.92s)]
*  Remember, he was murdered by a 34-year-old career criminal with more than 20 prior arrests. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  How's that defund, dismantle, reimagine the police thing working? No bail laws working. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  Now, Biden probably isn't even aware of the violent crime now erupting in major cities. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=127.28s)]
*  He certainly hasn't ever tried to address it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=132.72s)]
*  Now, tonight, he seems more worried about a political challenge from the left, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=135.04s)]
*  that being RFK Jr., who is now peeling off a significant amount of support from Biden. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=139.36s)]
*  And on Truth Social, President Trump wrote this, quote, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=145.84s)]
*  RFK Jr. is the most radical left candidate in the race by far. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=149.28s)]
*  He's a big fan of the green news scam and other economy killing disasters. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=154.0s)]
*  I guess this would mean that he's going to take votes from Crooked Joe Biden, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=159.68s)]
*  which would be a great service to America. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=163.92s)]
*  Then he continued, quote, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=166.64s)]
*  It is great for MAGA, but the communists will make it very hard for him to even get on the ballot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=168.24s)]
*  Now, Kennedy is now fighting against a bureaucratic nightmare. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=174.32s)]
*  Team Biden is going full force against him, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=178.56s)]
*  but he's vowing to get on the ballot in all 50 states. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  He's considering running as a libertarian now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  If he does, polls show clear wins for Donald Trump in the following states, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=192.8s)]
*  In other words, that would be an electoral blowout. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  But even without RFK Jr., Trump is consistently polling ahead [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=202.08s)]
*  of Biden and almost all of the key battleground states. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=206.24s)]
*  Now, as it turns out, Americans seem to miss prosperity and peace and stability and safety [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=209.76s)]
*  and security. Now they see what Biden is doing at the border. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=216.56s)]
*  They know he has been spending recklessly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  They see Biden inflation. It is starting to surge yet again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=222.72s)]
*  They reject the overbearing Green New Deal regulations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, you've got to get an electric vehicle. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=231.04s)]
*  They want to take away your stove, your refrigerator, your air conditioner, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=233.28s)]
*  and they want you to they want to even take away your meat. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  The high taxes he's pushing for, the vilification of those that work hard, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=239.04s)]
*  risk capital and definitely pay their fair share. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=244.4s)]
*  And then some. And they look at their phones and TV and they see a decrepit politician struggling [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=248.56s)]
*  to get up the stairs of Air Force One, the baby steps, and is so obviously unable to perform the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=255.92s)]
*  duties of his job. There is nothing that Obama can do, Clinton can do to cover up that disaster. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=262.4s)]
*  He might even say it's kind of like putting lipstick on a pig at this point. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6rwkrUIh0&t=268.24s)]
