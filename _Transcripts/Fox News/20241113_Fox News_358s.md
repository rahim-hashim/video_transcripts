# Alina Habba: If Judge Merchan wants to have any dignity, he should 'dismiss' Trump case
**Fox News:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo)
*  And now, tonight, the left-wing's weaponization of justice against President-elect Trump continues [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=0.0s)]
*  to crumble. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=7.74s)]
*  Earlier today, the judge in Donald Trump's falsified business document case, Judge Juan [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=8.74s)]
*  Murchon, paused all court deadlines, including the November 26 sentencing date, to consider [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=14.34s)]
*  the effect of his victory in last week's election. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=20.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, attorney for President Trump and his spokesman, legal spokesperson Alina Haba, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=23.8s)]
*  has, according to reports, emerged as a frontrunner for the role of White House press secretary. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=29.96s)]
*  Alina joins us now with reaction. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=35.24s)]
*  First of all, it was your legal team that, in fact, requested this delay, indefinite [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=37.44s)]
*  delay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=45.44s)]
*  Finally, Judge Murchon agreed to something. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=46.44s)]
*  But for all intents and purposes, isn't this case really dead? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=50.44s)]
*  It was dead upon arrival, Sean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=56.84s)]
*  We know that this case was never supposed to be brought. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=58.4s)]
*  We also know that the DOJ had appointed people, Pomerance included, that were supposed to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=61.4s)]
*  go in and investigate Trump before he decided to run for office. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=65.92s)]
*  And then when he decided to run for office, they brought charges. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=69.32s)]
*  We know what this has been. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=73.6s)]
*  We've been talking about it for years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=74.72s)]
*  This was a sham trial that was brought to keep President Trump in the New York courts, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=76.28s)]
*  as all these cases were. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=80.72s)]
*  And they failed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=82.52s)]
*  So now we have a judge who, frankly, should have dismissed it today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=83.52s)]
*  Hopefully he will. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=86.16s)]
*  He should. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=87.16s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has spoken on this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=88.96s)]
*  You know, it's exhausting to the American people at this point. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=90.96s)]
*  I think they spoke loudly on November 5th about why they're tired of it and the direction [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=93.36s)]
*  the American people want to go, which is America first, policies, security, economic, prosperity, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=97.72s)]
*  things like that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=103.56s)]
*  Not these sham trials and not seeing people from the left put in DOJs to attack political [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=104.72s)]
*  opponents. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  This should never have been brought. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  And if you actually look at it, Sean, this was a case that was denied. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Nobody wanted to bring it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=115.84s)]
*  Alvin Bragg didn't want to bring it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=117.8s)]
*  And then you're looking at people like Jack Smith. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=119.68s)]
*  Fifty million, we found out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=121.28s)]
*  Fifty million dollars of taxpayer dollars against going against a political opponent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=122.68s)]
*  America's had enough. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=128.04s)]
*  They spoke loudly on November 5th. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=129.04s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to the next administration stopping this lawfare and witch hunt. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=130.2s)]
*  OK, so let me ask you, what is the likely decision that the judge will make in this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=134.84s)]
*  case when, I guess, it finally goes before him for a final adjudication? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=139.88s)]
*  It should be dismissed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=145.64s)]
*  There's actual, you know, first of all, there's testimony that came out that should not have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=150.76s)]
*  come out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=154.44s)]
*  There's nothing that the president did wrong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=155.44s)]
*  This case was past the statute of limitations, just like Tish James, just like everything [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  else. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=162.44s)]
*  This was a complete political opponent move. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=163.44s)]
*  This has nothing to do with legal eloquence, legal lawfare, statutes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=166.48s)]
*  It was a state case that was stacked so that they could make it a federal case to try and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=171.88s)]
*  prevent him from becoming president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=176.84s)]
*  And it didn't work, Sean. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=178.96s)]
*  So it should be dismissed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  It should never have been brought. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  And if Judge Mershon wants to have any dignity, any dignity from the American people in the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=183.76s)]
*  robe, in the office of all attorneys and judges and the DOJ, he should stop this nonsense [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=188.72s)]
*  right away. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=194.48s)]
*  As you pointed out, I mean, it was past the statute of limitations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=195.48s)]
*  They didâ€”they stacked charge upon charge upon charge. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=200.56s)]
*  I think maybe one of the more egregious parts of this, and evidence of the weaponization [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=205.08s)]
*  of Biden's DOJ, is their third-highest-ranking official came in to help Alvin Bragg. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=209.88s)]
*  Nobody is going to give up that spot to go work for Alvin Bragg in New York City when [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=217.8s)]
*  they're the third-highest official in the DOJ, but they did that anyway. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  Sean, I'll one-up you on that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=228.0s)]
*  Take a look at the White House logs. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=230.6s)]
*  Take a look at the DAs and the AGs that have come in and coordinated with the president [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=232.2s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=235.72s)]
*  That's the Harris administration. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=236.72s)]
*  That's the woman that just ran against President Trump and lost, in a major way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=237.72s)]
*  America is done with this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=243.28s)]
*  We see it for what it is. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=245.56s)]
*  It was lawfare. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=246.76s)]
*  There is nothing he did wrong. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=247.76s)]
*  They put his legalâ€”the judges, they tried all the way up to the Supreme Court and lost. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=249.48s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  The American people are speaking loudly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  You cannot attack political opponents who have done nothing wrong. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=258.3s)]
*  You cannot put people from the DOJ, you cannot put Hillary Clinton's law firm in charge [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=261.42s)]
*  of prosecuting political opponents. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=266.1s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=268.02000000000004s)]
*  I hope that the American people never have to speak about this again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=269.38s)]
*  I really do, and I believe President Trump will make sure of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=272.62s)]
*  Let's talk about the possibility and reports that you might be the president's press secretary. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=275.54s)]
*  Any truth to it? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  I leave it to the president and three people that are on my board of directors. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=285.66s)]
*  That's Luke, Chloe and Parker, my children. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=288.86s)]
*  Everybody will know in time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=291.18s)]
*  All right, now I got to go in a little harder. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=293.18s)]
*  Have there been any discussions about it? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=296.62s)]
*  Justâ€”Sean, you know me better than that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=299.74s)]
*  You would never have me on prime time if I answered questions like that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=303.92s)]
*  Look, President Trump has put together an amazing cabinet. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=307.26s)]
*  I'm really proud of the work that him and his transition team have done. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=310.38s)]
*  I think when we look at everybody, they are killing it on all fronts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  America's excited for aâ€”frankly, sorry to use Mrs. Waltz's term, but turn a page. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=316.94s)]
*  It's time to turn the page. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=322.18s)]
*  It's time to have advocacy for America first. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  And whatever that looks like for President Trump and his team, I trust it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=326.22s)]
*  It's a decision for all of them to make, not me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, serious question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=331.94000000000005s)]
*  If you were asked to serve in that role or any other role, would you? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  I am very loyal to President Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  I would think about it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=340.82000000000005s)]
*  Very seriously. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=344.14s)]
*  Alina Haba, thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmqCtdUVZo&t=345.14s)]
