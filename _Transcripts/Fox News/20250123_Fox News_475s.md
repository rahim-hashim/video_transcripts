# ‘MAGNIFICENT' MOMENT: Jon Voight celebrates Trump’s inauguration
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A)
*  All right, this is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=0.0s)]
*  We are awaiting President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump and their arrival. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  We are at the Commander in Chief Ball. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  We believe this will be the first ball they stop by. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=9.64s)]
*  Joining us now, he is one of America's greatest actors and President Trump's ambassador to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=12.6s)]
*  Hollywood along with Rocky Balboa himself, Sly Stallone and Mel Gibson, three of my favorite [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=18.56s)]
*  people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=26.0s)]
*  Good night cowboy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=27.0s)]
*  John Voight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=28.2s)]
*  We have been friends for many years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=29.28s)]
*  Great to see you, my friend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=31.96s)]
*  It's wonderful to see you, Sean. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=32.96s)]
*  You know, Sean, I remember, I remember when he came down that, you know, that escalator, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=35.08s)]
*  that golden escalator, and you came forth immediately to back his chances and stayed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=44.2s)]
*  with him from the top. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=51.2s)]
*  And you had a lot of flack coming at you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=52.92s)]
*  And I said, this man can do it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=55.14s)]
*  But I can do it too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=56.92s)]
*  I think you do it, you do it more eloquently. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=58.88s)]
*  There have been moments when you would pop up, very pivotal moments. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=62.56s)]
*  And in that powerful, you make this powerful presentation that very few are capable of, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=67.92s)]
*  which made you one of the world's best actors. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=75.88s)]
*  And it's not easy in your business to do what you do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=78.56s)]
*  Well, I would say, I would say we both experienced that kind of warnings and flack, but we finally [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=82.68s)]
*  made it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=90.72s)]
*  And I remember early on, you and I got together on several Freedom concerts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=91.72s)]
*  And for those of you who don't know what they are, there were these wonderful concerts when [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=97.28s)]
*  he felt, when Sean felt, that the kids were starting to lose a connection with the greatness [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=103.78s)]
*  of the country and our history and the schools and everywhere. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  And he put these concerts on and they were the most wonderful concerts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  And I came here tonight to say, will you please produce a couple of more of those concerts [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  for the children of today? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=125.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a great idea. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  We did it for a scholarship fund for the children of slain soldiers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=129.08s)]
*  And I remember calling you and saying, would you be a special guest? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=135.36s)]
*  And you would command the stage. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=139.7s)]
*  And I felt at that time we had to go all in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=141.82s)]
*  By the way, right behind us, I don't know if you can catch it on camera, but Pete Hegseth, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=145.38s)]
*  soon to be defense secretary, my former colleague, longtime friend. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  He's a great person. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  But you know, this is special. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  I'm not surprised you're at this ball because the military has been a passion and a cause [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=158.98s)]
*  of yours for a long, long time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=164.62s)]
*  That's where we made our first connection. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=168.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=170.46s)]
*  And you know, Pete and I, Pete called me up way back in the early 20s and asked me to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=171.46s)]
*  come and speak to people, to military people who are going to tour the country and get [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=177.66000000000003s)]
*  them up to date about what was happening, you know, across the world with our military. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=184.5s)]
*  This was maybe 2005 or something. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  And I saw him then and he gave a speech. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=194.88s)]
*  And there was maybe only you could have given such an eloquent and passionate speech on [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  behalf of the military. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=202.74s)]
*  And I said, this guy's a comrade. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=203.74s)]
*  Boy, he's wonderful. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=205.5s)]
*  You know what is amazing? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=206.5s)]
*  I don't think and it's funny, you know, other news networks are here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=208.46s)]
*  And I just looked at the monitor and they're putting on Jamie Raskin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's like they don't understand in this election what happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=218.46s)]
*  And I said that legacy media died and they died because they've been lying to the American [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=222.82s)]
*  people ever since he came down that escalator. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=227.78s)]
*  They have peddled conspiracy theories. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=231.22s)]
*  They have weaponized justice, FISA warrants, Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=233.34s)]
*  You know, Mar-a-Lago is worth 18 million when it's really worth a billion or a billion and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=238.78s)]
*  a half. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  And not one Democrat cared. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they question Trump appointees. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=248.62s)]
*  Well, you're not going to weaponize the department, are you? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, where were you back when it matters? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=254.02s)]
*  That's what they understand. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=256.74s)]
*  They know how to do that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=257.74s)]
*  Well, they're pros at it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=259.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=262.14s)]
*  You spend a lot of time with the president. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=263.46s)]
*  I've said to people, I wish people knew another side of him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=265.58s)]
*  I feel he's showing it more. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=272.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=274.02s)]
*  You see the same thing? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=275.02s)]
*  Well, I think people are getting it more. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=276.02s)]
*  I think people are starting to understand it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=277.46s)]
*  He was magnificent today, was he not? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=280.02s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  And what he, when he stepped up today is usually, you know, a little different character. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  He was very serious today with his speech and he really, he really stated everything [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=290.78s)]
*  because he's an honest man. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=298.62s)]
*  He tells you the truth. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=299.9s)]
*  Well, he was able to do that and settle these things. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=301.5s)]
*  This is this and this is that and this is what we're going to do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=305.94s)]
*  One of the things, you know, I mean, so eloquent in that, in that aspect. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=309.82s)]
*  I thought it was one of the best speeches I've ever heard him give because it was, we [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=314.58s)]
*  are going to change. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=318.94s)]
*  We're going to start today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=320.38s)]
*  He literally spent hours today signing executive orders, by the way, and taking questions from [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=322.38s)]
*  the media. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=327.38s)]
*  We haven't seen a lot of that the last four years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=328.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=330.46s)]
*  And I took a lot of. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=331.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=332.46s)]
*  And you know, there's a friend of mine, dear friend of mine who works with me on my speeches [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=333.5s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  Great person. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=339.26s)]
*  And she said at the end of his speech at the Coliseum or the, you know, the that first [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=340.26s)]
*  speech, she said, now that's a president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=347.46s)]
*  And that's. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you mean today's inaugural speech? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  No, not this one. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  Either one. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  She said, that's a president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  Maybe people are starting to get, you know, in touch with so many things because they're [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=359.5s)]
*  hoping that it will make their lives better and it will. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=364.54s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  How come there are there is there is a group of the Americans that in spite of nearly 14, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  15, whatever the whatever the number is, illegal immigrants, we've got the videos, we've got [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=377.54s)]
*  the pictures. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=382.98s)]
*  They're coming from 200 countries. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=383.98s)]
*  What they say to us, Kamala and Joe said the border is secure. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=386.24s)]
*  They said that for four years and they say inflation is transitory. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=390.64s)]
*  It's not transitory. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=395.76s)]
*  And then they said, no, Joe has more energy than than five of the young staffers put together [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  and he can barely put two sentences together. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=403.64s)]
*  And they just flat out lie to us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x1mXNmHf2A&t=406.12s)]
