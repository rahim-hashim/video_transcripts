# Hannity: This is a clear and present danger to the entire country
**Fox News:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg)
*  But first, last night, we played you this disturbing video showing a group of illegal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=0.0s)]
*  immigrants in Times Square viciously attacking NYPD officers last weekend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=5.12s)]
*  Now, the suspects, they were arrested, they were taken to jail, but as per New York law, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=10.32s)]
*  sadly, they were quickly released due to New York's disastrous no bail laws, and two of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=15.76s)]
*  illegals were caught on tape. Given the middle fingers, they waltzed out of jail. That was very, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=21.36s)]
*  very thoughtful of them. Senator Marco Rubio summed it up perfectly in a tweet. He wrote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=26.88s)]
*  quote, message to America from one of the illegal immigrants who assaulted NYPD officers, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=31.84s)]
*  walk free with no bail and heads back to a shelter funded by taxpayers. And now, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=38.8s)]
*  according to new reports tonight, four of the men charged, they've now successfully fled [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=44.4s)]
*  to Gavin Newsom's sanctuary state of California. Good luck getting them back to New York for their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=50.08s)]
*  court date. Earlier today, New York governor Kathy Hochul, she was asked about the suspects. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=55.28s)]
*  She offered this response. Take a look. Any response to police searching for additional [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  suspects in the Times Square attack on police? Get them all and send them back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=65.92s)]
*  You don't touch our police officers. You don't touch any of them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=71.68s)]
*  Wow. All of a sudden a change of heart from what? New York governor Hochul. After all, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=75.12s)]
*  it was her policies that helped lead to the vicious attacks. And by the way, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=80.0s)]
*  let's take a little trip down memory lane. You might remember when she said [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=84.4s)]
*  this kind of thing. Take a look. We want people to come here despite where they came from or [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  despite the circumstances that drove them to this country, into this, into this state. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=94.56s)]
*  We see say you are welcome here. You're welcome with open arms and we'll work to keep you safe. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=99.28s)]
*  We'll not only house you, but we'll protect you. Oh, they were welcome until they got the bill and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  three and four star hotel rooms that they were given to illegal immigrants in New York City. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  All right. This Biden made crisis. It needs to end right now. Illegal immigrants. They're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  just pouring into this country. They're coming from these countries. We keep reminding you Iran, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=122.24s)]
*  Syria, Afghanistan, China, Russia, some of our top adversaries. But now we also have top retired FBI [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=126.88s)]
*  officials warning Congress of the danger, calling this an invasion of military age men. And just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=133.6s)]
*  today ICE officials announcing that they captured a known terrorist who illegally entered the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=140.0s)]
*  country back in March of 2023. And it gets worse. According to a new report in the Washington [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=145.44s)]
*  Washington Examiner, a watchdog investigation found that your tax dollars, they're being funneled [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=151.6s)]
*  directly to illegal immigrants. According to the report, illegal immigrants coming to the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=157.6s)]
*  southern border, they have received over $1 billion in money cards, envelopes of cash [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=162.64s)]
*  and other benefits all paid for by you, the taxpayer. Not only is Joe aiding and abetting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=169.12s)]
*  in the law breaking, he's now using your money to pay illegals to break the law. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  So what's Biden's big solution? Well, he says he needs Congress to help him secure the border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=180.24s)]
*  No, that's another lie. He said he's done everything he can. No, Joe is lying. He doesn't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  need Congress at all. Joe can simply reinstate all of the Trump era policies that were working [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=193.2s)]
*  with this most secure border in history. And he can do it with the stroke of a pen just as quickly [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  as he undid them with a stroke of the pen. And by the way, some members of Congress didn't exactly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=205.2s)]
*  inspire confidence with their votes today. Look at this in the House of Representatives. They passed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  the bill to deport illegal immigrants found guilty of drunk driving, but 150 Democrats voted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=216.8s)]
*  against the bill. Why would anybody be against this? This is the radical, extreme, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=224.56s)]
*  new green deal, climate alarmist, religious cult, Democratic Party of today. This is a clear and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=231.84s)]
*  present danger to the entire country. And even worse, radical squad members like Cori Bush and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman Tlaib, they voted against the bill banning Hamas terrorists from the U.S. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=243.36s)]
*  You can't make up this insanity. Now, the legislation says that no person who, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=250.08s)]
*  quote, participated in planned, financed, afforded material support to or otherwise facilitated the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel or attacks after that shall be ineligible for any [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=263.12s)]
*  relief under the immigration laws. How did Democrats, 150 of them, justify allowing even [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=270.32s)]
*  known terrorists into the country? They have lost their minds. And while Democrats refuse to do [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=276.56s)]
*  anything to secure the borders, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he's taking the necessary action. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=282.08s)]
*  By the way, with the help of 25 Republican governors around the country who deserve a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=287.76s)]
*  lot of credit, but he is refusing to cut down the razor wire. He's leaving the Texas National Guard [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=293.12s)]
*  in place in Eagle Pass. He has the support of nearly every Republican governor across the country, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=298.96s)]
*  including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who today announced he is sending his state's national guard [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  to help and assist what he is calling an invasion. Take a look. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=310.32s)]
*  So today we are going to fortify our presence along the southern border. We're providing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=315.84s)]
*  up to one battalion of Florida National Guard, as well as our first ever deployment of the Florida [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=323.04s)]
*  State Guard. And the goal is to help Texas fortify this border, help them strengthen the barricades, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=330.88s)]
*  help them add barriers, help them add the wire that they need to so that we can stop this invasion [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=339.92s)]
*  once and for all. By the way, Governor DeSantis will join us in a few minutes. But first, our very [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=346.72s)]
*  own Bill Mollugian. He is reporting that there has been a significant shift in illegals entering [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=351.76s)]
*  Texas, with more than 70 percent of the border crossings of illegal immigrants in the last week [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=357.2s)]
*  of January taking place in Arizona and California, not Texas. Maybe Governor Abbott chased them away. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, Bill Mollugian joins us now with the full report tonight. Bill? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=369.76s)]
*  Hey, Sean. Well, we got some new data we've gotten from CBP sources that shows illegal [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=374.24s)]
*  crossings in Texas have just plummeted in recent weeks. And now a large majority of the traffic is [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=378.48s)]
*  moving to Arizona and right here to California. So let's dive into these numbers here. Take a look. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=384.16s)]
*  CBP sources telling me in the last week of January, there were more than 32,800 border [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=388.72s)]
*  patrol apprehensions of illegal immigrants across the southern border. About 23,500 of those were [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=394.48s)]
*  in Arizona and California. That is 71 percent of the crossings in the last week. So why is this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=400.8s)]
*  happening? Well, Texas's Del Rio sector, which includes Eagle Pass, was seeing massive illegal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=407.2s)]
*  crossings back in December, some days with three or four thousand in a single day. We all remember [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  this viral video just showing how bad it was there. Well, since then, Mexico has started [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=416.64s)]
*  increasing enforcement on their side of the border. This was after a late December meeting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=422.0s)]
*  with U.S. cabinet officials. And Texas, as we've been reporting, has locked down their side of the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=426.56s)]
*  border. They've taken over Shelby Park and Eagle Pass. They've kicked the feds out and they've been [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=432.24s)]
*  fortifying the area with legions of razor wire soldiers and troopers. And we'll talk about the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=436.16s)]
*  impact enforcement has had on both sides of the border. Look at these numbers. According to CBP [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  sources, border patrol apprehended over 71,000 illegal immigrants in that Del Rio sector in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=446.56s)]
*  December. Well, that number dropped to just under 17,000 in January. That is a 76 percent decrease [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=452.24s)]
*  in a single month. It's great to see the result where we're seeing the numbers that have now [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=460.48s)]
*  plummeted. I think we're now down to like 200 a day rather than the thousands that we've seen [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=465.04s)]
*  sitting there in Eagle Pass. Now you're seeing the numbers move to California. And Sean, you mentioned [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  earlier Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced today he is sending hundreds of Florida National [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=475.6s)]
*  Guard soldiers and Florida State Guard to Texas to continue to help the state. It was actually [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=480.16s)]
*  Florida Governor DeSantis who was the first governor back in 2021 who sent state troopers [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=484.72s)]
*  to Texas where they've been assisting Texas DPS and the National Guard in making apprehensions [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=489.92s)]
*  of illegal immigrants. We'll send it back to you. Bill, do you have any update on Joe Biden's Friday [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=494.8s)]
*  deadline? Remember he had a deadline Friday that the CBP would have the right to cut down the razor [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=500.56s)]
*  wire. Interestingly, they came out with statements, their union came out with statements saying they [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  have no intention of cutting down that razor wire. They pretty much voiced their support for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=512.32s)]
*  everything the Texas National Guard has been doing. There have been a lot of Democrats wanting [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=517.6s)]
*  Joe Biden to federalize the Texas Guard. Any updates or is Joe going to just let that deadline [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=522.4s)]
*  come and go like most deadlines? The feds backed down. They blinked. They gave him a Friday deadline. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=527.84s)]
*  Texas basically laughed at him, said, nope, we're not doing it. And Attorney General Ken Paxson [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=533.84s)]
*  actually sent a letter to the feds basically saying your request is denied. So no, Texas did [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=539.12s)]
*  not give in. All right. Bill Mollutian, great work at the border. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFZAnvYzdg&t=543.92s)]
