# Hannity: Kamala is now dropping in the polls state after state
**Fox News:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8)
*  And welcome to Hannity this Friday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=0.0s)]
*  We start with this Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=3.88s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is now on stage at a massive rally in Reno, Nevada. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And we're going to take some of his remarks coming up straight ahead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  First we check in with his opponent, Kamala Harris, who is starting, well, to lose it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  on the campaign trail. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=19.56s)]
*  And that's saying it mildly. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=21.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=22.6s)]
*  So when we think about what's at stake in this election, whoa, it's packed with some [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=24.28s)]
*  stuff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=30.8s)]
*  It's packed with some fundamental stuff. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=31.8s)]
*  I say rather articulately. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  Now despite all the nervous, giggling, bizarre giggling, the joy is absolutely gone. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=46.2s)]
*  Kamala is now dropping in the polls in state after state, hemorrhaging support among Hispanic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=52.0s)]
*  Americans, African American men, Barack Obama. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=56.88s)]
*  Well, he was brought in for support. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=59.92s)]
*  And he said they were not supporting Kamala and even suggested because she's a woman, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=62.28s)]
*  accusing what, African American men of sexism? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=67.84s)]
*  I doubt that will be particularly helpful. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=71.16s)]
*  In reality, many are supporting Donald Trump because their lives were simply better under [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  his administration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=79.2s)]
*  Let's look at the numbers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=80.2s)]
*  Under Trump, 4.1 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=81.66000000000001s)]
*  While under Obama, the amount of people living under poverty went up 787,000, according to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=85.54s)]
*  Fox Business. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=91.36s)]
*  Minority groups experienced what was the largest improvements. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=93.14s)]
*  While the overall poverty rate declined 1.3 percentage points, black poverty, African [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=96.94s)]
*  American poverty fell by 2 percentage points. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  Hispanic American poverty fell by 1.8 percentage points. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=107.26s)]
*  Asian American poverty, that fell by 2.8 percent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=110.9s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=114.3s)]
*  Wages were also way up for everyone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=115.3s)]
*  Quote, while the overall growth rate was 6.8 percent, real median income grew by an even [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=118.38s)]
*  greater 7.9 percent for African Americans, 7.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, 10.6 [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=124.42s)]
*  percent for Asian Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=131.94s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, inflation was almost nonexistent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=134.06s)]
*  But under Biden and Harris, things have changed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=137.34s)]
*  Americans are struggling to get by. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=140.26s)]
*  But those first three years, record low after record low after record low, unemployment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=141.74s)]
*  for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=148.22s)]
*  African American youth unemployment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=152.98s)]
*  Before the pandemic, we were rolling. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=155.14s)]
*  Now, Kamala is only offering more of the same, or frankly, worse, if her stated positions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=157.34s)]
*  ever became reality. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=163.42s)]
*  In fact, with her radical economic views and her stated plans on new taxes, we would, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  as a country, be in huge trouble if she gets elected. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=170.86s)]
*  It is radical. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  It is extreme. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  It would be, well, the New Green Deal would be the end of capitalism as we know it, other [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  than constantly claiming that she grew up in a middle class, which seems to be the answer [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=180.78s)]
*  to like every question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  Kamala has no plan to bring down prices. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=187.18s)]
*  But she did go on Univision last night, and she did unveil a brand new accent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=190.1s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=195.94s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for the question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=196.94s)]
*  I hope your family is OK and your home is OK. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=199.5s)]
*  Yes, you are, ma'am. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=202.58s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=203.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=204.58s)]
*  Does Kamala have a plan to fix the economy? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=205.58s)]
*  No. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=208.18s)]
*  Does she have a plan to fix the border? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=209.18s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=210.18s)]
*  Will she bring peace in the Middle East and Europe? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=212.06s)]
*  Will she hold Iran in check? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=214.9s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=216.62s)]
*  But she does have a lot of different accents. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=217.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  Have you no empathy, man? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  You know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  Hello to all my Divine Nine brothers and sisters and my sorrows. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  You better thank a union member for sick leave. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  You better thank a union member for paid leave. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  You better thank a union member for vacation time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  You all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  Let's just get through the next 64 days. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  Have a... [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  And yesterday, extremists passed book bans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  Book bans for this year of our work 2024. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=256.3s)]
*  The courts are going to handle that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=259.3s)]
*  We're going to beat them in November. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=261.3s)]
*  Do I see people testifying? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=262.3s)]
*  Can I get a witness? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=267.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=270.3s)]
*  Luckily, there is more to the Harris campaign, the nervous giggling and fake accents. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=271.3s)]
*  But the giggling, it's getting weird. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=276.22s)]
*  To use their favorite phrase. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=279.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=281.22s)]
*  Roughly a trillion dollars with a T. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=282.22s)]
*  I had to. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=287.22s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=289.22s)]
*  One of the things I love are Venn diagrams. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=294.22s)]
*  I love Venn diagrams. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=300.22s)]
*  More parents are seeing the value of educators when they had to bring their kids. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  And saying, we're not paying them nearly enough. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not giggling when I go to the grocery store or if I fill up my car when I see unvetted [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  Harris Biden, illegal immigrants, and read stories they commit murder and rape and other [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  violent crimes, and it's costing tens and tens of billions of dollars. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not laughing when FEMA, we find out that a billion dollars was raided out of FEMA, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=331.46s)]
*  which is supposed to help Americans during disasters, and that money went to Harris Biden [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=338.46s)]
*  unvetted illegals. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=343.46s)]
*  I'm not laughing when they're lifting sanctions and making the mullahs in Iran rich again [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=345.46s)]
*  so that they can foment more of their terror as the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=351.46s)]
*  Now, she can laugh and laugh and giggle and giggle, but this weekend her campaign is rolling [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=356.46s)]
*  out Kamala's running mate to woo male voters, according to Politico. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=360.58s)]
*  Quote, the Harris campaign is sending the Minnesota governor on a man-focused media [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=365.58s)]
*  blitz. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=371.58s)]
*  OK, what's that? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=372.58s)]
*  That includes football-focused TV interviews, pheasant hunting with digital influencers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=373.58s)]
*  OK, after all, what blue collar guy doesn't relate to a pheasant hunting trip with influencers? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=380.58s)]
*  With influencers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=387.7s)]
*  For the record, I've never been pheasant hunting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=388.7s)]
*  But the governor's first stop on his man-focused media blitz was an interview with former NFL [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=392.46s)]
*  star Michael Strahan, and it didn't really go that well. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=397.38s)]
*  And Michael's not exactly, you know, the toughest interviewer in the world, but he [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=400.86s)]
*  did press him a little. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=405.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=406.26s)]
*  Do you think that Biden has done everything right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=407.26s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know if any of us do everything right, but I can tell you he's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=409.46s)]
*  done everything in the best interest of the American public. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=412.94s)]
*  He's listened to what the public did. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=415.62s)]
*  He's asked for answers and I think, you know, and reevaluated afterwards. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=417.94s)]
*  And I think if your values and the judgments you're making and the ethical decisions you're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=421.7s)]
*  making, he's done that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  He said, I think all of us know the electoral college needs to go. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=427.42s)]
*  But the campaign came out later that night, and they said that's not their stance. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's not the campaign's position. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=434.98s)]
*  And the point I'm trying to make is that there's folks that feel every vote must count in every [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  state. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=441.5s)]
*  So that's not something that you and our president Harris disagree on? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=442.5s)]
*  I have spoken about it in the past that she's been very clear on this and the campaign and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=445.26s)]
*  my position is the campaign's position. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=448.94s)]
*  Can you make sense of that? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=452.78s)]
*  I can't. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=453.86s)]
*  Anyway, instead of trying to pander to different groups of people, maybe the Harris campaign [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=454.86s)]
*  should figure out what they stand for and what they're going to do for the country [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=459.06s)]
*  short of, yeah, we like everything that Joe did. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=463.34s)]
*  And of course, Kamala's true ideology is so radical and extreme that most Americans, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=467.86s)]
*  if they knew about it, wouldn't ever think about voting for her. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=473.66s)]
*  So they're trying to fake their way into the White House, of course, with the help of the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=476.9s)]
*  state-run media mob. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  And meanwhile, tonight, former President Trump, he's on the campaign trail. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=482.26s)]
*  He's in Reno, Nevada, where he's holding a huge rally. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=485.9s)]
*  As a matter of fact, let's take some of that live. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKg-bJOaO8&t=488.7s)]
