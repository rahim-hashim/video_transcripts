*  No, do I find it funny that somebody that's been vice president of our country? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  For four years now all of a sudden on day one is going to deal with inflation and secure the border on then she did mention [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=14.82s)]
*  That she would give a path to citizenship in other words amnesty to all the illegal immigrants. She let in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=21.6s)]
*  I'm sure she hopes they vote for her [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=27.54s)]
*  Of course [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=31.0s)]
*  Sean that's the whole point isn't it? That's the reason that they've [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=33.08s)]
*  endangered America in the way that they have and all of us especially women and children you're seeing day after day [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=37.72s)]
*  these sexual predators who are illegal aliens that were allowed in by the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=44.92s)]
*  borders are Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=50.72s)]
*  attacking raping and murdering young girls and women [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=54.82s)]
*  it's you know, it really isn't safe and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  It's terrifying and for Kamala Harris to portray herself as some sort of champion of women [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  She is the opposite. She doesn't care about women at all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  All she's interested in is herself and these lies that she tells this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=73.44s)]
*  Pretends that she's going to be tougher on the border than Donald Trump. I mean she could do it tomorrow [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=79.0s)]
*  She could change [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=85.84s)]
*  What's going on now tomorrow, but she won't because she never will that's not her plan [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  Her plan is to regularize all these illegal aliens and sexual predators and criminals that are in the country [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Thanks to her and if you believe that she is going to crack down on the border [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=99.56s)]
*  Then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=104.48s)]
*  You know the person I find this amazing governor Huckabee and I'm sure you have a humorous take on it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=108.12s)]
*  There's nothing really funny about it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=114.26s)]
*  But the person that actually was a tie-breaking vote when it came to the Inflation Reduction Act that hired all these these IRS [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  Agents to go after people that are taxed on that are not paying their taxes on tips [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  The same woman that said she wants a mandatory gun buyback doesn't want anymore the same person that said [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I absolutely am against fracking and drilling and all of these conversions only happened [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=134.28s)]
*  Once she became the presumptive nominee to be the Democratic candidate that tells me that they know [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=141.10000000000002s)]
*  This campaign knows that if she stands on her position [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=147.74s)]
*  She cannot win and the media is protecting them as per usual reaction. I [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Think as much as I enjoy using humor to communicate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=157.86s)]
*  There's just nothing I can laugh about here because the people who are hurting the most [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  This 46 year old woman who was violently raped at Coney Island for God's sake supposed to be a place to go and have some fun [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  By people who should never have been here the guy that beat up the cop in broad daylight in Times Square [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=175.84s)]
*  And he gets no bail he gets back on the street and he's now arrested again [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=181.84s)]
*  Somebody might say and the progressives usually do well this could have happened without it illegal immigrants [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=186.18s)]
*  That's not the point it happened because there were people who should never have been allowed in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=191.3s)]
*  And if they committed a crime, they should have been deported immediately are imprisoned immediately neither of which happened [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=196.56s)]
*  This is a lawless administration and I've got friends who say well, I don't want to vote for Donald Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=203.76s)]
*  I just don't like his personality. My answer to that is get over it. You're not voting on a person or a personality [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=209.62s)]
*  You're voting on policies and the policies of this administration are deadly and dangerous for a lot of innocent Americans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=216.6s)]
*  Like Lincoln Riley and others who were murdered who will never have their lives back their families shattered beyond belief [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=223.52s)]
*  Because this government that is currently in power. They just simply don't care [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=231.08s)]
*  All right. Thank you both governor. Appreciate you being with us Miranda Devine. Thank you when we come back [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT9OVNwtdsY&t=238.16s)]
