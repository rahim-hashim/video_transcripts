# President Donald Trump: It's like a nuclear weapon went off in Los Angeles
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4)
*  In less than 48 hours, President Trump granted more access to the press than his predecessor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=0.0s)]
*  did in four long years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=6.24s)]
*  Here's part two of our exclusive interview. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=8.96s)]
*  What do you do, sanctuary states, by definition, or sanctuary cities, they're aiding and abetting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=13.24s)]
*  in the law breaking? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=19.68s)]
*  OK, they're going to get federal funds? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=20.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=22.96s)]
*  We're trying to get rid of them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=23.96s)]
*  We're trying to end them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=24.96s)]
*  And a lot of the people in those communities don't want them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=25.96s)]
*  You know, California is a big example. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=27.92s)]
*  They cut off their money. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  I might have to do that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=30.84s)]
*  Sometimes that's the only thing you can do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=32.48s)]
*  Look, California is a great example of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=34.32s)]
*  If you actually polled the people, they don't want sanctuary cities, but Gavin Newsom does [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=37.4s)]
*  and these radical left politicians do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=42.2s)]
*  And you know, if you asked them why, they couldn't even answer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=45.96s)]
*  I watched Gavin Newsom try to answer that question. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  He was unable to even answer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=51.04s)]
*  He looked like an idiot. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=52.4s)]
*  He was unable to answer. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  I ask him one other question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=55.12s)]
*  Why is it that you don't want millions of gallons of water a day pouring throughout [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=57.32s)]
*  California? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=62.48s)]
*  You know, the farmland in California is, they say, the equivalent of Iowa, great land, but [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=63.48s)]
*  it's got no water. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=68.92s)]
*  And you sit there and it's literally, you can see it burning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=70.6s)]
*  It's on flame. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=73.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=74.6s)]
*  All they need is water and they have big farmland. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=75.6s)]
*  And I ask him, why, how is it possible that you're not allowing this water? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=77.56s)]
*  They diverted out to the Pacific Ocean where it drops into the ocean. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=82.24s)]
*  And you know what it's like? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=86.6s)]
*  It's like nothing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=87.6s)]
*  To the Pacific Ocean, it's like two glasses of water. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=88.72s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=93.52s)]
*  Millions of gallons of water is diverted way up north in California into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=95.3s)]
*  That water, you know, they have the pipes in it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=103.56s)]
*  It's half pipes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=106.0s)]
*  You see them all the time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Half pipes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=108.74s)]
*  People live in those half pipes now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=110.24s)]
*  You know, they have homeless living in those half pipes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=112.16s)]
*  But this is water that millions of gallons of water a week and a day in some cases, you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=114.64s)]
*  know, depending on the flow, so much water they wouldn't know what to do with it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=122.8s)]
*  Your sprinklers would be filled. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=126.96s)]
*  They can even—you remember when I took criticism because they said, you have to manage your [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=129.12s)]
*  forest? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  The head of a country that lives in forests—a number of them, actually. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=134.8s)]
*  Finland told me this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  Austria told me this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=141.4s)]
*  Head of Austria, head of Finland. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  And it was beautiful the way they expressed it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  They said, we live in a forest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=147.4s)]
*  We are a forest nation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=150.46s)]
*  That's beautiful, isn't it, to say that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=151.96s)]
*  We have trees that are the most magnificent in the world, far more beautiful than what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  they have in California and much more flammable. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=160.72s)]
*  He said, we don't have forest fires. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=164.0s)]
*  We manage our forests. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=166.2s)]
*  You can get a degree in forestry. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=167.2s)]
*  Well, they'll do cuts, yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=168.88s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=170.32s)]
*  But you don't need much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=171.32s)]
*  You have to clean the floors of the forest. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=173.64s)]
*  You know, when they had forests—I go to see some of the sites I watched in California. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=176.72s)]
*  They used billions of dollars of money. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=182.2s)]
*  And they do say—you know, and look at what happened. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=184.72s)]
*  Los Angeles—that's like a nuclear weapon went off, what's happened to Los Angeles. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  And you know, that thing went for four or five days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=193.12s)]
*  Nobody was even fighting it because they didn't have any water. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=195.08s)]
*  Their fire departments aren't funded properly. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=199.08s)]
*  And the firefighters were brave as hell. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=202.36s)]
*  They were fighting without water. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=204.52s)]
*  I mean, they turn on a fire hydrant. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=205.96s)]
*  There's no water that comes out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=208.0s)]
*  And they're sitting—and the fires are rushing at them at 30, 40 miles an hour. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=209.9s)]
*  Those firefighters were brave. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=214.44s)]
*  What happened to that state is incredible. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=217.08s)]
*  And then you listen to—I remember when Ron DeSantis and Gavin Newsom were debating on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=220.0s)]
*  your show. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=226.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=227.96s)]
*  And Newsom's talking like, everything's great. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=228.96s)]
*  Oh, everything's great, just great, just great. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=231.24s)]
*  More people left California this year than ever have left in history before the fire. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=234.44s)]
*  But look at it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=241.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=242.72s)]
*  And you know, the amazing thing, these are wealthy people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=243.72s)]
*  Many wealthy people lost their homes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  I saw somebody on television, one of the wealthiest people, one of the most powerful people in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=247.64s)]
*  the country, being interviewed as though he were a vagrant. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=252.4s)]
*  His shirt was—and you have to know him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=256.4s)]
*  He's a mean, horrible human being. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=258.44s)]
*  He's a tough guy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=260.64s)]
*  Very tough guy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  A horrible person. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  But he's very rich and very— [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  He's rich, but he's a horrible person. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=265.64s)]
*  No, he's a horrible human being. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=266.64s)]
*  I know you have rich people that are very nice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=268.12s)]
*  But this guy's a terrible person. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=270.08s)]
*  So I say, that's so-and-so. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=271.76s)]
*  I said to Milani, I said, look at it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  They were interviewing him as a guy that lost his house. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=277.84s)]
*  He said, they took my house away. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=281.08s)]
*  And he's literally in his underwear and his t-shirt. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=283.96s)]
*  It looked like he just got out of the bedroom. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=287.64s)]
*  And I say, that's one of the wealthiest guys in the country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=290.2s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=293.2s)]
*  Take a look at him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=294.88s)]
*  Somebody I'll tell you the name, maybe after the interview. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=295.88s)]
*  But you won't even believe it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  But he was on television as somebody that— [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=301.84s)]
*  Milani, they wouldn't let him go to his house, which was on fire. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=302.88s)]
*  They wouldn't let him go, because, you know, they don't want him to die. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=306.32s)]
*  No, some of the wealthiest, most powerful people lost their homes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  And it looked like our country was helpless. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=313.84s)]
*  This fire was just raging. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=318.58s)]
*  And then it would catch to another air, another air, another air. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=320.88s)]
*  There was nothing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=323.52s)]
*  It took a week and a half. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=324.52s)]
*  And I've never seen anything like it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=326.91999999999996s)]

*  I want to— [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=368.48s)]

*  Right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=384.84000000000003s)]

*  By the way, you see that now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=390.11999999999995s)]

*  The Delta Smelt. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  I was with Devin Nunes, another Republican congressman, and I looked at these vast areas [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  of land, and it looked like it was just burning. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  It was dark. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  It was dry. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=402.67999999999995s)]
*  And then there'd be a little patch, a little tiny patch of green, beautiful green. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=404.32s)]
*  And I said, why—how come all this land has these little patches? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=408.79999999999995s)]

*  No. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=418.28s)]
*  They've turned off the water. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=419.28s)]
*  They turned off the spigot from up north in order to protect the Delta Smelt. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=420.28s)]

*  Just—well, the— [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=432.4s)]
*  It's not endangered, either. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=433.4s)]
*  They have it in other locations, etc., etc. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=434.4s)]
*  They're doing seemingly everything they could do, like New York is in many ways, to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=436.55999999999995s)]

*  No, but could you imagine today— [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=442.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=444.32s)]
*  —when people—and the press doesn't like—when I talk about the water that they're turning [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=445.32s)]
*  into the Pacific, the press never wants to put it on, the fake news. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=448.92s)]
*  They don't want to put it on, Sean. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=453.92s)]

*  fake news. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=463.72s)]

*  And they didn't stop. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=474.6s)]
*  And here's the interesting part to me, is that all of the attacks, all the weaponization, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=476.12s)]
*  all the FISA warrants, all the Russia—Russia, and we can go on, all the various venues, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=482.08s)]
*  the J-6 committee, which kept out a lot of pertinent information. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=489.8s)]
*  How about the J-6 committee? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  I say—I go with the unselect. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=495.16s)]
*  You know, they say it's the select. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=496.16s)]

*  No, no. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=498.16s)]
*  No. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=499.16s)]
*  What they did was criminal. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=500.16s)]
*  That's why they got pardoned. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=501.16s)]
*  No, I'm saying that— [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=502.16s)]
*  They deleted and destroyed all of the information that they collected over two years. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=503.16s)]
*  Why else would they need a pardon? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=506.36s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=507.68s)]
*  Because it proved I was right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=508.68s)]
*  All of that information was deleted and destroyed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  They deleted all of the information having to do with the 10,000 soldiers that I offered [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=513.96s)]
*  to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=518.36s)]
*  And she's now on tape admitting it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=519.36s)]
*  I have four of the five people on tape, and General Milley was the fifth in writing, all [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  saying that you authorized it in the days leading up. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=526.28s)]
*  The Capitol police chief asked for the guard, was begging for the guard. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  Muriel Bowser, in writing, denied the use of the guard. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=534.28s)]
*  That story was— [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  But Nancy Pelosi even more strongly denied it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  She said that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=540.3599999999999s)]
*  She was responsible for the whole thing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  She took responsibility. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  She was—and she took responsibility for her daughter. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=546.56s)]
*  They found the daughter's tape, a videotape of her mother saying that she was responsible. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=548.52s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=553.8s)]
*  And they tried to lose it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  But when— [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me move on to the economy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=557.4399999999999s)]

*  She lost by a number that nobody has ever lost by. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=577.28s)]
*  You know why? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=580.84s)]
*  Because usually, when you have a poll and you're down by, like, 40 or 50 points, you're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=581.84s)]
*  smart enough to drop out. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=585.4s)]
*  She should have dropped out. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=587.24s)]
*  At least she wouldn't have that moniker. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=588.24s)]
*  Before I go to the economy and foreign policy, let me—as long as you brought up this topic, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=589.24s)]

*  They were incredible patriots. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=647.88s)]
*  We had people that suffered. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=649.58s)]
*  You had Bannon put in jail. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=652.52s)]

*  And those people—and people said, you know—and they don't even—they wouldn't have even [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=668.4s)]
*  taken—most of those people, they wouldn't have even taken a pardon. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  This guy went around giving everybody pardons. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=677.2399999999999s)]
*  And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=679.48s)]
*  And if you look at it, it all had to do with him. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, the money went to him. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=691.36s)]
*  Should Congress investigate that? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=693.64s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=695.04s)]
*  It's—you know, I've always— [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=696.04s)]
*  Well, you ordered the DOJ. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=697.04s)]
*  I've always been—look, he didn't give himself a pardon. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=698.04s)]
*  And he didn't give some other people a pardon that needed it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=702.48s)]
*  And I heard Schiff went to him and just begged him for a pardon, because Schiff is a crook. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=705.76s)]
*  Schiff is a crooked guy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a crooked politician. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=712.48s)]
*  He made up the story about Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=714.76s)]
*  He totally made it up. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, he's a storyteller. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  And then, after he made it up, they found out that there was a tape of the conversation [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  made by, you know, I guess, the State Department. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=725.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=730.24s)]
*  When you make calls, they make tapes sometimes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=731.24s)]
*  Not all the time, but sometimes. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=733.24s)]
*  He was the one talking to the Russians. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=734.24s)]
*  So, he, in the meantime, made up the conversation, totally made it up, about quid pro quo. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=735.52s)]
*  There was no quid pro quo. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=740.48s)]
*  Just the—there was a perfect call. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=742.04s)]
*  Tim Scott was the first one to come. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  He read it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=745.4s)]
*  He said, this is a perfect call. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=746.4s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=748.76s)]
*  You're impeaching a man for a perfect call. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=749.76s)]
*  It was Schiff. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Schiff, Hillary, the whole group. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=757.12s)]
*  They should—Schiff is just a bad, sick guy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=758.52s)]
*  And he went to Biden, and he demanded a pardon because he thought he did something. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=764.56s)]
*  He knew he did something. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Thompson won the chairman of that committee. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Thompson destroyed, destroyed, along with that unselected committee, destroyed [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=772.76s)]
*  all of the work that took place over two years. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=780.84s)]
*  You know why? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=783.6s)]
*  It showed that I was right. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=784.6s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ns70m_6r4&t=794.52s)]
