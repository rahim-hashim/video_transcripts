# Hannity: This is what’s at stake in November
**Fox News:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE)
*  Welcome to Hannity. Last night's results have made it all but certain that we in America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=0.0s)]
*  we will have a rematch between Donald J. Trump and Joe Biden come November. That is, of course, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=9.18s)]
*  assuming that Joe doesn't have a disastrous fall or complete cognitive breakdown. What [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=15.56s)]
*  we are seeing from Donald Trump, we're watching history, frankly. Now, he continues to win [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=22.04s)]
*  contest after contest despite opposition from the radical left and what is a politicized and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=26.92s)]
*  weaponized system, Department of Justice. And meanwhile, warning signs there flashing for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=32.64s)]
*  Joe Biden. He lost the American Samoa caucuses to somebody I know I never heard of. I don't think [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=38.44s)]
*  anybody's ever heard of. And elsewhere, a staggering number of Democratic voters, when given the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=44.88s)]
*  opportunity, opted to vote for the uncommitted option. Look there on your page in a protest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=50.0s)]
*  against the president. Minnesota, almost 19 percent. North Carolina, almost 13 percent. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=56.28s)]
*  Massachusetts, more than 9 percent. In Colorado, over 8 percent. Tennessee, 7 percent. And 8 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=61.64s)]
*  percent. Now Alabama, 6 percent. And in Iowa, almost 4 percent of voters. Yeah, they selected [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=68.72s)]
*  not Joe, any other option, but Joe, as we continue. Then we have the polls. Look at Gallup. Joe has a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=75.92s)]
*  38 percent approval rating. That's near record low. Recently ABC had 86 percent of Americans [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=83.0s)]
*  saying, frankly, he's too old. Currently Joe is losing in the New York Times, Sienna poll, the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=89.28s)]
*  Fox News poll, Wall Street Journal poll, NBC poll, CBS poll. Well, Trump is at 52 percent there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=94.88s)]
*  And add to that, he is bleeding massive support among what has historically been the Democratic [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=102.64s)]
*  Party base, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people and suburban women. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=109.0s)]
*  Now on the important issues of our time, Joe is viewed as a failure on almost every issue. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=115.0s)]
*  Now I do add caution to all of this. We are literally 243 days away until election day, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  which is the equivalent of 10 lifetimes in politics. And a lot can and will happen between [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=128.44s)]
*  now and November 5th of this year. But still, over at Morning Joe, Liberal Joe, our old friend [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=134.0s)]
*  at MSDNC, he's trying to claim that Donald Trump wouldn't want to debate Joe Biden on policy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=140.56s)]
*  Take a look. It's a damn shame that that Donald Trump won't submit to this because he's such a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=147.84s)]
*  coward when it comes to politics. But but it would be great to have Joe Biden right there, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=154.16s)]
*  Donald Trump right there around any table and say there's no shouting, there's no this, there's no [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=160.28s)]
*  insults. We're going to ask you about policy and actually have them talk about because Joe Biden, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=167.4s)]
*  like I said, can take you around the world a hundred times. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=175.64s)]
*  Well, Liberal Joe, you might want to look at this. This afternoon, Trump offered to debate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=181.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, quote, anytime, anywhere, any place. We're now in the midst of the biggest choice [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=185.76s)]
*  election in our lifetime. It's election, an election choice between the radical left and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=190.8s)]
*  their insane ideology and common sense, American first conservatism and an agenda that's working [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=195.28s)]
*  that would work for the American people. A choice between the climate alarmist, religious cultists [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=201.84s)]
*  coming for your cars, your appliances, your stoves, refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=207.44s)]
*  even your steak, your red meat and other food that you eat versus not just energy independence, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  but it's a choice between energy dominance, a choice between law and order and safety and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=219.16s)]
*  security, which is a prerequisite for pursuing happiness in this country versus defund, dismantle, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=224.2s)]
*  reimagine, no bail laws and the police bye bye. It's a choice between a thriving economy, lower [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  taxes, less regulation and lower interest rates, or the Biden policy is leading to more than 60% [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=238.92s)]
*  of Americans that live currently paycheck to paycheck, a choice between peace through strength [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=245.88s)]
*  or more appeasement of our top geopolitical adversaries, Russia, China, Iran and others. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  The entire world is watching a weak and frail Joe Biden fail to stand up to them on every front. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=258.76s)]
*  It is a choice between safe and secure borders or Joe Biden's open borders agenda that is allowing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=266.12s)]
*  millions of unvetted illegal immigrants into our country from places that hate us, including China, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=272.2s)]
*  Russia, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan. This is what is at stake come November 5th. And last night, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=279.32s)]
*  as results were pouring in, well, over there at MSDNC and their Super Tuesday panel, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=286.36s)]
*  they're actually mocking Republicans for their concern in this particular case in the state of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  Virginia over the issues. And of course, well, they also played the race card. Take a look. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=298.68s)]
*  Republican voters don't vote that way. They don't vote based on economics or based on the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=305.88s)]
*  benefits they're getting economically from the president. They're increasingly from the Tea [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=310.68s)]
*  Party on they're voting on race. They're voting on this idea of an invasion of brown people over [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=314.76s)]
*  the border, the idea that they can't get whatever job they want. A black person got it, therefore [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=319.96s)]
*  drive all the blacks out of the colleges, get rid of DEI. That is what they're voting on. They're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  just voting specifically on racial animus at this stage. It isn't about economics. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=329.64s)]
*  No, which is why Trump killed the immigration bill. Correct. That's why. And because otherwise [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=334.68s)]
*  he can't run against the other and brown people and people who don't look like him, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  like his supporters, his base of supporters coming across the border and scaring people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=346.36s)]
*  and killing people or whatever he's threatening out there. I mean, if you look at some of these [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  exit polls, I mean, I live in Virginia. Immigration was the number one issue. I mean, again, these [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=355.56s)]
*  could change in Virginia. Virginia does have a border with West Virginia. Very, very contested. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  What? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  Seriously? I dare them to say that to Laken Reilly's parents. Let me educate the sanctimonious [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  conspiracy theory peddling leftist elites over at MSDNC because illegal immigration is a nationwide [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  problem and Virginia is no exception and voters were rightfully concerned. Listen to these alleged [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=384.44s)]
*  crimes committed by illegals in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Just in the last year, an illegal [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=391.16s)]
*  immigrant from Venezuela was arrested. Why? Allegedly sexually assaulting a 14 year old little [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  girl. Just last month, Jen Psaki, by the way, are you still giggling? Maddow, you giggling too? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=403.8s)]
*  And this past June, another illegal was arrested attempting to abduct a four year old little girl. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  And in August, an illegal from Nicaragua was arrested after allegedly fracturing a police [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=416.76s)]
*  officer's skull in a DUI. Also that month, yet another illegal immigrant was charged with [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=423.08s)]
*  abduction and three counts of rape. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. They don't keep [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  national statistics on violent crimes of illegal immigrants, but over at MSDNC, well, you got Jen [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=434.68s)]
*  Psaki, you got conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid. You want to mock this? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=441.24s)]
*  Why don't you take the time and call their family? See how they feel about it. And you want to mock [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=447.8s)]
*  voters and their concerns over what is a very real, clear present danger, which is the biggest [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=452.76s)]
*  national security threat in our lifetime. Or as a former top FBI official said, an invasion of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=459.16s)]
*  military age men, it's all frankly repulsive, ignorant, out of touch, but it shouldn't surprise [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  anyone. This is but the latest example in a long list of insults launched at Republicans, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=471.56s)]
*  you know, irredeemable, deplorable, smelly Walmart shoppers and on and on and on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUsfB_paaUE&t=477.32s)]
