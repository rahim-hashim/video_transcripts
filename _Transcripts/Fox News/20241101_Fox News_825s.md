# Hannity debunks the left's 'smear tactics' as Election Day closes in
**Fox News:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU)
*  Welcome to Hannity this Friday night, and we start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=0.0s)]
*  At this hour, we are monitoring a massive Trump rally tonight in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=6.2s)]
*  where the former president will soon take to the stage, and we will bring you his remarks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=11.34s)]
*  live as they happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=15.16s)]
*  But first, another day, another desperate hoax from the Harris campaign and their allies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=16.44s)]
*  and the state-run media mob. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=22.52s)]
*  They know of no shame. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=24.66s)]
*  If you watch fake news CNN, MSDNC, the three major networks, or read the headlines on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=26.66s)]
*  Google, or any other wing of the state-run media mob, you might think that Donald Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=32.1s)]
*  called for Liz Cheney to be shot and killed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=38.42s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=41.38s)]
*  For example, here's the awful AP quote, Harris assails Trump for saying Liz Cheney [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=42.58s)]
*  should have rifles shooting at her. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=48.0s)]
*  It is not only misleading, it is completely false, and yet another outright lie, a big [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=51.22s)]
*  lie designed to smear, slander, besmirch Donald Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=58.76s)]
*  Let's listen to what Donald Trump actually said in its full context, and you will understand it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=63.44s)]
*  She's a radical war hawk. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=70.42s)]
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=73.06s)]
*  Let's see how she feels about it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=77.18s)]
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=79.22s)]
*  You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=82.66s)]
*  oh gee, Will, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=86.62s)]
*  But she's a stupid person, and I used to have, I'd have meetings with a lot of people, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=93.26s)]
*  she always wanted to go to war with people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=99.74s)]
*  So Donald Trump, frankly, rightly, accusing Cheney of being a war hawk, and from the comfort [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=103.74s)]
*  and safety of the United States, without ever having to fight a war, but they'll send your [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=110.16s)]
*  sons and daughters to fight a war they're all jacked up to fight, only to politicize [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=115.1s)]
*  the war, only to leave, you know, and having failed in their mission. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  How often has that happened in Washington? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=125.06s)]
*  The hysteria on the left, all of it is phony, fake and fraudulent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=127.36s)]
*  But this sums up the entire far-left extreme radical Democratic Party. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=133.54s)]
*  It sums up the entire Harris campaign and their propagandists and the state-run media [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=137.66s)]
*  mob. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=142.94s)]
*  It is all built on one big lie after another. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=143.94s)]
*  They have been lying to you for almost 10 years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=147.42s)]
*  This is what Trump has had to go through for almost 10 years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=151.1s)]
*  They accused Donald Trump, putting the Capitol complex at risk on January 6, despite the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=154.46s)]
*  president's request for National Guard protection three days prior and the request of the Capitol [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=159.64s)]
*  police chief and others, five witnesses confirming that Donald Trump did, in fact, offer 10,000 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=166.2s)]
*  plus National Guard troops. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=173.92s)]
*  The Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel Bowser, she said no in a formal letter, in writing, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=176.16s)]
*  denying Donald Trump's request. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=182.88s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi on tape taking responsibility. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=184.72s)]
*  I should have taken it more seriously for the security breakdown, which would be her job. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=188.4s)]
*  The left's entire narrative about that day is one big lie. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=193.08s)]
*  Of course, they ignore Kamala Harris, and the bail fund will get to that in a second. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=197.32s)]
*  Then of course, Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=201.72s)]
*  Another huge, big lie. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=205.84s)]
*  The left-wing radical leftist Democrats and the state-run media mob, three long years [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  of nothing but lies and phony conspiracy theories peddled by the Democrats and the media to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=215.1s)]
*  you, to all of you, to all of us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=221.14s)]
*  The Ukrainian quid pro quo, another big lie, as they ignored the likely quid pro quo. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=224.1s)]
*  That would be with Joe Biden. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=229.5s)]
*  Now, both impeachment, they were built on big lies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=230.78s)]
*  The claim that Trump was going to cause World War III, no, another big lie. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=233.94s)]
*  The Hunter Biden laptop story is Russian, likely Russian disinformation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=239.34s)]
*  Another big lie perpetrated by Biden and led by Wink and Tony Blinken, getting 51 former [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=244.22s)]
*  intel officials that do nothing about the laptop to lie to the American people, to give [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  him a talking point for a debate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=256.62s)]
*  And what, 30-plus percent of Americans said they would have voted differently had they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=259.14s)]
*  known it was real, and big tech suppressing it all. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, and as usual, a repulsively, abusively biased, corrupt media, they went along with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=266.1s)]
*  the lie. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=272.38s)]
*  Oh, inflation is transitory. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=273.58s)]
*  That was another big lie. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=275.62s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act is going to reduce inflation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=277.02s)]
*  No, another lie. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=280.34s)]
*  And by the way, if you're interested, the economy is still a nightmare. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=281.5s)]
*  We have the latest numbers, as usual, horrific. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=284.74s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=288.3s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=289.9s)]
*  That was a big lie for three years, from Kamala and Joe and Mayorkas, Kamala's own surrogate [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=291.44s)]
*  Bill Clinton. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=297.38s)]
*  He actually admitted campaigning for Kamala. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=298.38s)]
*  I talked to her family, lovely people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=301.02s)]
*  She would still be, likely still be alive today, had her killer been vetted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=303.74s)]
*  And meanwhile, it was a big lie to tout a border security bill from day one, when in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=308.9s)]
*  reality, that was never a border security bill. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=313.38s)]
*  It was an amnesty bill that allowed nearly 2 million illegal immigrants in a year, unvetted [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=316.26s)]
*  also. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=322.18s)]
*  It was not a border security bill. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  It was an amnesty bill. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=324.94s)]
*  It was a big lie that Trump will wage lawfare against his political opponents. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=326.44s)]
*  Instead, that is exactly what has been done to him by a weaponized Department of Justice [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=330.56s)]
*  under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=336.44s)]
*  The entire Harris agenda is also a big lie. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=338.88s)]
*  It's a big lie that she won't ban fracking and offshore drilling. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=342.64s)]
*  She has stated over and over again she will do this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=346.1s)]
*  It's a big lie she won't try to limit the Second Amendment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=350.24s)]
*  Repeatedly, in her own words, she has said she wants a mandatory gun buyback program. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=353.32s)]
*  Where I grew up, we'd call that gun confiscation. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=359.08s)]
*  It's a big lie that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are big gun people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=362.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=366.84s)]
*  Tim Walz could barely even load his own shotgun during a pheasant hunt campaign stunt a few [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=367.84s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a big lie Kamala won't try to eliminate the filibuster to pass the $93 trillion Green [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=376.36s)]
*  New Deal that would eliminate capitalism as we know it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Now how do I know that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  Because she co-sponsored the bill in the U.S. Senate with Bernie Sanders and said she would [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=386.56s)]
*  eliminate the filibuster to pass it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a big lie that Kamala won't raise taxes on everyone. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=393.44s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=396.72s)]
*  She lies when she says Trump will raise taxes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  That's a lie, too. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=400.32s)]
*  It's a lie that Kamala will even try to bring down prices. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=401.64s)]
*  And it's a big lie that she won't eliminate private healthcare plans because she stated [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=406.48s)]
*  it emphatically when she supported the Government Health Care for All Act with the elimination [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=411.3s)]
*  of private health insurance. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=416.14s)]
*  It's a big lie Kamala will magically secure the border as president, like it was a lie [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=417.86s)]
*  when she blames Trump for the border disaster that she herself as the border czar created. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=422.38s)]
*  It's a big lie that Kamala is a law and order candidate. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=428.7s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  Take a look at the bail fund she supported. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=436.34s)]
*  Four days. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=437.34s)]
*  It's a 574 riot summer of 2020. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  Four days after Minneapolis police precinct burned to the ground, she sends out a bail [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  fund tweet. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  At the time, she goes on CBS and tells that hard-hitting newsman Steve Colbert that the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=448.46s)]
*  rioters, take note, beware. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  The rioters are not going to stop, and they shouldn't stop, and she's not going to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=456.65999999999997s)]

*  this will all work itself out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=732.76s)]
*  They're still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a fact. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=734.52s)]
*  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jryMuS9E5YU&t=737.68s)]
