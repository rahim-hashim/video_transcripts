# Sean Hannity: This is good news for the country and the world
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ)
*  First, we have major developments from President Trump's peace through strength diplomacy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Good news for the country, good news for the world. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=4.74s)]
*  Today, the president threatened major large-scale sanctions against Russia and Vladimir Putin [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=6.96s)]
*  if they continue to escalate their war with Ukraine while he is negotiating a peace. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=12.56s)]
*  The president was particularly tough on Putin, writing, quote, I am strongly considering [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=18.34s)]
*  large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=23.24s)]
*  settlement agreement of peace is reached to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=29.84s)]
*  Get to the table right now before it is too late. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=35.04s)]
*  Putin is now saying he is ready for a truce. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=38.56s)]
*  Critical talks with Ukraine and the U.S. are planned for next week in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=41.64s)]
*  That's called progress. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  What did I say a week ago? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=47.84s)]
*  We're not patting ourselves on the back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=48.84s)]
*  What did I say after the Zelensky meeting didn't go well at the White House? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=51.04s)]
*  I said he would be back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=55.04s)]
*  He has no other place to go. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=56.78s)]
*  It's in everybody's best interest that the killing and destruction ends. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=58.8s)]
*  This did not take long. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=64.2s)]
*  Now the president is ratcheting up the heat on Putin and not too far away in Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=65.6s)]
*  Peace might also soon be on the horizon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=70.68s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's maximum pressure campaign there appears to be paying off. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=73.36s)]
*  Today the president teased a possible nuclear deal that would put an end to the Mueller's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=77.72000000000001s)]
*  nuclear aspirations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  In fact the president sent a letter to the Mueller's of Iran, discussed the contents [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  of that letter with our very own Maria Bartiromo. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=89.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=92.4s)]
*  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=93.4s)]
*  as good as if you won militarily. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  But the time is happening now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=99.98s)]
*  The time is coming up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=101.48s)]
*  Something's going to happen one way or the other. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I hope that Iran, and I've written them a letter saying I hope you're going to negotiate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=104.68s)]
*  because if we have to go in militarily it's going to be a terrible thing for them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  Now that entire interview with Maria will air this weekend on Sunday Morning Futures [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=115.34s)]
*  on the Fox News channel right here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  But after weeks of nonstop action it's safe to say that the Trump agenda is making big [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  progress both at home and abroad. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=126.04s)]
*  Now the same cannot be said for the Democratic Party. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=128.28s)]
*  They have no discernible plan to improve the country at all whatsoever and then to make [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=131.34s)]
*  matters worse. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=136.66s)]
*  Where's the hope and the joy? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=138.3s)]
*  There's no sense of humor, no optimism, just anger, hatred, rage, no big ideas, no leadership. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=140.02s)]
*  Just anti-Trump rage 24-7 along with a heavy dose of intolerance for anybody with a different [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  opinion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=153.34s)]
*  After years of woke indoctrination, cancel culture, righteous indignation, Democrats [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=154.5s)]
*  totally forgot how to kind of just be normal, authentic, to have a heart, a conscience, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=160.22s)]
*  a soul, sympathy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=165.46s)]
*  We got yet another weird, bizarre, cringe-worthy video. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=167.5s)]
*  This time from the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries who filmed himself doing some kind [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=172.78s)]
*  of pre-rehearsed rant. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=178.06s)]
*  Okay, take a look. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  Here's the latest. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=181.54s)]
*  Just finished up a telephone town hall meeting with my dynamic sister, our attorney general [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=182.54s)]
*  Tish James, and my team informs me that some far-right extremists have introduced a resolution [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=187.66s)]
*  to try to throw Democratic members of the House off of our committees. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=196.26s)]
*  That resolution is going nowhere. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  You ain't throwing no one off of any single committee. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=205.86s)]
*  These people are malignant clowns. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=211.86s)]
*  You aren't throwing anyone off of any committee in the House of Representatives. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=215.3s)]
*  Don't make me expose you to folks who don't know you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  Only thing missing was they're Hitler, they're Stalin, they're Mussolini. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  This is the leader of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  By the way, I didn't see him standing for the mothers that lost their daughters to unvetted [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=236.34s)]
*  Joe Biden Harris illegals or a 12-year-old young man that beat cancer or the wife of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  a hero whose husband died in the line of duty. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=249.22s)]
*  Why wasn't he standing? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=252.5s)]
*  Why wouldn't he stand for the First Lady? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  He would be speaker today if Democrats didn't get crushed in last year's election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=256.98s)]
*  And now he frankly looks empty and pathetic like his entire party. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=261.74s)]
*  And to be honest, this past week looked like a cry for help more than anything else, a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjRtgIBbCQ&t=265.78000000000003s)]
