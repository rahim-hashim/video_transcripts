# Kudlow: Thereâ€™s gonna be revolt over this
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY)
*  All right now for the latest liberal lunacy senator Bernie Sanders. Yes, the commie socialist from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=0.0s)]
*  Vermont introduced the bill it would establish a 32-hour workweek without any reduction in pay [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=7.48s)]
*  How generous of him problem is this would likely hurt a lot of small businesses [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=13.8s)]
*  We'll have more than in a moment. Meanwhile out in the great state of California [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=19.2s)]
*  lawmakers there are proposing a surcharge on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=22.92s)]
*  Electricity bills based off your income instead of usage [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=26.32s)]
*  Oh, I thought we treat people equally meaning the more you make the more you're gonna pay for the same exact energy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now is the host of cuddle Oh on the Fox Business Network. Larry cuddle is with us [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  All right, so I'm reading this and I'm like looking looking at this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  They already have the highest paid [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=46.76s)]
*  the highest income taxes in the country out in California [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=50.08s)]
*  You see business after business after business [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=53.78s)]
*  Leaving California the headquarters and you can't blame them [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=56.94s)]
*  Why don't they just say all of you people that make money and create jobs get out of our state? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=60.78s)]
*  Because that's ostensibly what they're they're doing anyway [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=65.62s)]
*  Yeah, give it yeah give us your money give us your money I mean what's so wonderful about this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=70.62s)]
*  California thing is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=76.66s)]
*  It's not even tied to electricity use [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=78.78s)]
*  It's just an income. It's an income tax increase and by the way [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=81.69999999999999s)]
*  Yes, the upper end pays more but the stupid part of this and this is where there's going to be revolt [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=86.66s)]
*  You look at the numbers here Sean the middle class is going to be charged significantly [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=92.46s)]
*  I did the math here the middle class right now pays about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=97.82s)]
*  3200 bucks a year for their electricity bills that by the way is at the highest in the nation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=103.06s)]
*  This would add about 1200 bucks whether you consume more or less [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=109.82s)]
*  Electricity it's going to go on your bill [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=116.66s)]
*  It's almost a one-third increase on middle class and yeah up the income ladder [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=118.5s)]
*  It pays more this just it's not it's not a carbon tax [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=124.06s)]
*  It has nothing to do with reducing in fact energy use may go up [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=128.3s)]
*  Under this thing in the certain cases and the whole problem in California is they don't have enough electricity [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=133.3s)]
*  Because renewables don't work. They're not sustainable. They break down. They're very expensive [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=140.02s)]
*  They should use oil which they have a lot of they should use natural gas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=147.26s)]
*  They could use coal they could use nuclear power, but they don't so they don't you can't plug in your car [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=152.18s)]
*  If you have an EV electric vehicle [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  You can't plug it in because they're always brownouts and blackouts of electricity this thing is just a dumb [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=162.1s)]
*  Middle-class tax hike in California. That's all it is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  And then when they tax corporations, and then they sue corporations like the sue and oil companies who pays the bill [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=173.7s)]
*  For those expensive law firms that have to defend themselves wouldn't that be the consumer Larry you're the expert [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=180.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no no that stuff gets passed along [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=187.84s)]
*  All the time and by the way that you know they're gonna start losing stuff in the courts [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=192.56s)]
*  I mean they're not these mandates that California is making up [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=197.36s)]
*  That had never been adjudicated. There are no congressional laws the state legislature [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=202.88s)]
*  May or may not pass this thing from what I gather there's a tax revolt going on look [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=207.76s)]
*  This is dumb and the Bernie Sanders 32-hour workweek is dumber or as dumb because there you've got [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=213.24s)]
*  Let's not work. Okay [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=220.52s)]
*  Already the participation rate among prime workers is at an all-time low [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=222.84s)]
*  there's probably 10 million people outside the workforce that could be producing and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=228.44s)]
*  Growing the economy and creating income, so let's not work Sean okay [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=234.68s)]
*  Let's just hang around watch TV. We got a video games habit joint. Let's not work. How dumb is that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8aMSEvMBaY&t=239.12s)]
