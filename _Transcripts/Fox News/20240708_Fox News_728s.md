# Sean Hannity: They’re obviously hiding something about Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and we are just 119 days away from the 2024 presidential election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=0.0s)]
*  only 70 days away from early voting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=12.0s)]
*  It begins in Pennsylvania, then rolls out in many states across the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=16.02s)]
*  And in just a moment, the 45th and possibly 47th president of the United States, Donald [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=21.34s)]
*  Trump, will join us for an exclusive interview. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  This will be President Trump's very first interview since Democrats and the state-run [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=30.2s)]
*  media mob started to acknowledge the obvious truth about Joe Biden's mental and physical [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  health and his cognitive decline. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=41.12s)]
*  The charade, the cover-up, the corruption, the lying, is now officially over. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=43.72s)]
*  They're pointing fingers and they're blaming and acting as if they were not complicit, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=48.76s)]
*  which is a joke. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=52.64s)]
*  And now it is America's time for choosing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=54.08s)]
*  Now, this isn't a choice between Trump and Biden. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=56.84s)]
*  Instead, you, you will decide and need to decide whether we have a constitutional republic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=59.92s)]
*  for the people, by the people, or will a cabal of Biden enablers and liars and state-run [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=66.08s)]
*  media lying and covering up and far-left, unelected deep state bureaucrats continue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=72.8s)]
*  to run this country into the ground with Biden or some other Democrat as their front person? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=78.6s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=85.48s)]
*  Joe Biden is not in charge at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=86.56s)]
*  He's not calling the shots. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=90.4s)]
*  He's not making the decisions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=91.72s)]
*  In fact, Joe has been a cognitive wreck from before he was even sworn in, which is something [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=93.04s)]
*  we have been reporting and been criticized for for more than four years before the 2020 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=106.16s)]
*  Take a look to remind you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=107.16s)]
*  We turn once again to the ever-weak, frail, cognitive mess that is all things Joey Biden [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=108.16s)]
*  and Sippy Cup. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=114.28s)]
*  He's so obviously having cognitive issues. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=115.76s)]
*  That's being polite. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=118.72s)]
*  After all, he's having more and more trouble recalling basic facts, what day of the week [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=120.16s)]
*  it is, what office he's running for. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=124.28s)]
*  They are obviously hiding something about Joe Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=126.8s)]
*  In all likelihood, they are hiding the full extent of Joe's cognitive struggles, because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=130.44s)]
*  when he does go out two, three days in a row, it's an unmitigated disaster. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=136.16s)]
*  In spite of the feigned outrage and shock and horror at the debate, everyone that works [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=141.72s)]
*  in state-run media, the mob, as I call them, they have known beyond any doubt that Joe [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=147.84s)]
*  Biden is mentally impaired. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=153.16s)]
*  For three years, he barely did any press conferences or other unscripted events. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=155.32s)]
*  He did very few sit-down interviews. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=160.28s)]
*  They were few and far between. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=163.12s)]
*  He struggled to walk with an unusual shuffle, barely getting his feet off the ground. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=164.52s)]
*  We saw him fall over and over and over again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=170.12s)]
*  Then the big boy steps up to Air Force One. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=173.56s)]
*  They were soon replaced with the little boy's staircase. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=175.9s)]
*  Also, Joe took almost every weekend off, and when he was at the White House, his calendar [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=178.68s)]
*  featured barely one public event on average per day. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=184.56s)]
*  Those events were always very short, tightly controlled, and still Joe struggled. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=188.84s)]
*  The majority of Americans, as much as 70 percent, have long believed that Biden is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=194.16s)]
*  not fit to serve. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=199.7s)]
*  It has been obvious Joe was never up to the job, but the media mob did their best to cover [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=201.64s)]
*  this up and lie for him for years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  They even tried to gaslight any American into thinking very real videos showing Biden's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=209.92s)]
*  struggles. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=217.24s)]
*  They were cheap fake videos. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=218.24s)]
*  Again, those very real videos were unedited. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=220.04s)]
*  This was only a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=224.12s)]
*  They attacked the special counsel, Robert Herr, because he dared to refer to Biden as [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=226.16s)]
*  an elderly man with a poor memory who was asking questions like, was I still vice president [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=231.32s)]
*  in 2009? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=237.16s)]
*  And now Joe Biden's weaponized Department of Justice is refusing to let you see the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Herr interview and decide for yourself. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, that is the DOJ's campaign contribution to Joe and a cover-up of monumental and historic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=247.0s)]
*  proportions. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=254.36s)]
*  This is bad for our country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=255.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, I was attacked repeatedly, called the conspiracy theorist, for pointing out [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=257.92s)]
*  the obvious, the transparent truth about Joe Biden's cognitive state. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=263.6s)]
*  They have been lying and covering up for Joe in what has been a coordinated effort to beat [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=269.08s)]
*  Donald Trump at any and all costs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=275.16s)]
*  They told the world that Biden was as sharp as ever. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=277.88s)]
*  He gets more done in an hour than most of you accomplish in a single day. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=281.12s)]
*  It's one huge lie. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=286.4s)]
*  And every American has been betrayed by this and this cover-up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=289.76s)]
*  And the country has suffered needlessly from the radical policies implemented by this new [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  Green Deal radical socialist Marxist party, all supported by state-run media and the mob. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=300.76s)]
*  But now finally the truth has started to emerge from the left, not out of concern for Biden [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  of the country, but because they fear they're going to lose to Donald Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=314.12s)]
*  The polls, they don't look good for Joe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=318.56s)]
*  Recent survey taken after Joe's disastrous debate shows Donald Trump up by 15 points [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=321.08s)]
*  in Arizona. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  That same poll has Trump up by five in Pennsylvania, four in Michigan. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=328.28s)]
*  Trump is ahead in every battleground state in the country and is up by several points [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=333.04s)]
*  in multiple nationwide polls. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=337.92s)]
*  But by the way, now Democrats, the media, they are trying to humiliate Biden, force [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=339.76s)]
*  him out of this race. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=345.2s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing bombshell reports like this one from ABC, quote, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=347.0s)]
*  Parkinson's expert visited White House eight times in eight months, met with Biden's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=351.56s)]
*  doctor. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=357.44s)]
*  And this story from Axios detailing the tremendous effort needed just to get Joe on a stage, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=358.44s)]
*  not only do staffers help guide the president in person, but apparently they also print [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=365.2s)]
*  out big pictures for Joe showing him the exact path to get to the podium and the stage, given [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=371.44s)]
*  simple step-by-step instructions and huge font like, walk to podium. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=378.52s)]
*  Actually says that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  But anyway, we continue. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  One staffer working at a fundraiser told Axios, quote, It surprised me that a seasoned political [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=389.76s)]
*  pro like the president would need detailed verbal and visual instructions on how to enter [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  and exit a room. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=401.56s)]
*  But it gets worse. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=403.08s)]
*  This week, our suspicions were confirmed. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=404.08s)]
*  It appears the White House, the Biden campaign, is in the habit of feeding pre-approved questions [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  to so-called journalists ahead of their interviews. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=412.32s)]
*  At least two radio hosts now have come forward admitting the Biden team provided, quote, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=415.56s)]
*  acceptable questions for the president. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=421.32s)]
*  And despite all of this assistance and collusion, Biden still struggles in a big way. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=423.6s)]
*  Here's Biden accidentally referring to himself as a black woman. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=433.92s)]
*  By the way, I'm proud to be, as I said, the first vice president, the first black woman [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=434.92s)]
*  to serve with a black president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=442.0s)]
*  On Sunday, another pretty unusual moment from Biden, who appeared to freeze up during a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=446.08s)]
*  church service, nervously looking toward his handlers for guidance. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=455.0s)]
*  Let us stand together, oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=456.0s)]
*  the burden of my heart rolled away. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=467.48s)]
*  It was there, my faith, I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=474.48s)]
*  Anyway, all weekend, Biden tried to demonstrate vigor, and instead he just humiliated himself [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=497.88s)]
*  Weird rambling stories, a thousand-yard gaze with emptiness in his eyes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=499.36s)]
*  You decide. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=504.72s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=505.72s)]
*  Once, after our—I went to a local parade, a little parade, a little place called Hocass [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=506.72s)]
*  in Delaware, right on the Pennsylvania border after our son had passed, and I was sitting [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=514.72s)]
*  there at home thinking he was his favorite parade, so I decided just to go into it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=520.32s)]
*  And I was walking along in this small community, and three guys, four guys about your size [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=525.12s)]
*  came running up to me. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=530.52s)]
*  I thought the secret was going to kill them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=531.52s)]
*  And they came running up. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=533.52s)]
*  I swear to God, true story. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=534.52s)]
*  I said, Joe, what's all this damn stuff about Pennsylvania? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=535.52s)]
*  You're from Delaware. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=538.52s)]
*  You're from Delaware. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=539.52s)]
*  Yeah, but it never gets—it never leaves you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=540.52s)]
*  And with your help, I know we have your help. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  With my help, helping us working together, we're going to get a hell of a lot done for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  the American people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=549.24s)]
*  And we're going to make sure these things are—so, anyway, I guess if I stand here [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=550.24s)]
*  long enough, all those folks in the back are going to die of sunstroke. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=555.88s)]
*  But I'm not able to do what I used to do. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=558.52s)]
*  I'd be riding down the street in the vehicle before and see a bunch of kids in the schoolyard [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=560.28s)]
*  waving. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=564.92s)]
*  I'd stop and get out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=565.92s)]
*  Realistically, I can't do that anymore. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=566.92s)]
*  It's just too dangerous, what's going on out there. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=568.92s)]
*  Remember, how many times have we shown videos? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't know whether to exit stage left, stage right, or turns and he shakes air, like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=579.92s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created by the thing. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=580.92s)]
*  Oh, you know the thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  God, the creator of everything. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=586.8s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  We still have yet to see a lengthy press conference from Joe. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=590.24s)]
*  Instead, on Friday, he sat down for a whopping 22 minutes with former Clinton attack dog [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=593.24s)]
*  Georgi Stephanopoulos in another sad attempt to demonstrate vigor. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=599.12s)]
*  He told Georgi will have no regrets about staying in the race so long as he does, quote, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=603.28s)]
*  his goodest job he can do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=609.12s)]
*  Okay, take a look. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=612.12s)]
*  And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you're warning about comes to pass, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=614.72s)]
*  how will you feel in January? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  I feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=622.48s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=628.88s)]
*  Goodest job. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=630.88s)]
*  And only a message from God himself would cause him to step down. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=631.88s)]
*  But now more and more Democrats disagree. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  They want Joe out, but Joe's closest advisers are not going to let that happen. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jill and Hunter Biden want Biden to stay in this race no matter what. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=642.08s)]
*  They are desperately clinging to power in what Michael Moore is comparing to elder abuse. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=647.26s)]
*  So will Biden survive this politically and make it to November? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=652.08s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=656.0s)]
*  Let me tell you what is clear. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=657.08s)]
*  Joe isn't running the show at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=658.72s)]
*  And know this, know that one thing, every name of every Democrat mentioned as a possible [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=662.36s)]
*  replacement, understand this is a radicalized, New Green Deal, socialist Marxist party. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=669.8s)]
*  They will implement the same failed policies as Joe on the economy, immigration, law and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=679.72s)]
*  order, on energy, education, America abandoning their role as the leader of the free world. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=685.76s)]
*  It won't make a difference if it's him or any of the other Marxist, socialist, radical [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=692.6s)]
*  New Green Deal Democrats. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=698.04s)]
*  So if you truly value our Democratic Republic over a permanent bureaucracy, there's really [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=700.14s)]
*  only one choice this election, early voting. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=706.96s)]
*  It starts in 70 days. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=710.4s)]
*  When we come back, my exclusive interview with Donald J. Trump. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=712.52s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myL49XLz1KA&t=715.56s)]
