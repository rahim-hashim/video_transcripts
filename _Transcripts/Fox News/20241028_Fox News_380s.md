# Hulk Hogan leg-drops the polls, Kamala Harris' word salads
**Fox News:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0)
*  So, after captivating America with his Trumpamania speech at the RNC and endorsing Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=0.0s)]
*  Paul Kogan, he appeared on stage at Donald Trump's massive Madison Square Garden rally [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=5.76s)]
*  in New York City yesterday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=11.28s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  You know, when I hear my president and our president, Donald Trump, speak, he sounds [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  for real, brother. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=20.96s)]
*  He sounds like he has a heart of gold that's all for the USA. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=22.64s)]
*  But when I hear Kamala speak, it sounds, yeah, it sounds like a script from Hollywood with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=28.56s)]
*  a really, really bad actress. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  We all know Trump is the only man that can fix this country today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=43.84s)]
*  And with Trump as our commander in chief, peace through strength will fix all the problems [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=53.44s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=60.92s)]
*  Here with more wrestling legend himself, what does that say on your shirt? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=63.36s)]
*  The one and only legend, Hulk Hogan, is with us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=68.2s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=71.0s)]
*  You are having too much fun out there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=72.0s)]
*  I'm great, brother. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=73.64s)]
*  I still got my Trump pump on, brother, from Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=74.96s)]
*  You know, I work out, not that—I'm not taking you on either. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=80.4s)]
*  You were great in one of the Rocky movies, and I remember the size difference. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my gosh, that was brutal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=88.64s)]
*  And then at the end, it was funny. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=92.04s)]
*  All right, so you tapped into something that I think is really relevant. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump is real. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=97.92s)]
*  I do interview after interview after interview with Donald Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=99.2s)]
*  I have one tomorrow with him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=102.18s)]
*  And these are not scripted answers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=104.76s)]
*  These are answers from the heart. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=107.34s)]
*  Namela can't talk about her real views, so she has to hide them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=109.12s)]
*  I think that's a big part of why she's not doing well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=113.56s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=115.64s)]
*  Well, the main problem I have with her is she will never answer the question. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=116.64s)]
*  Whenever she's confronted, if she has the answer, she won't tell you the answer, because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=123.48s)]
*  at the end of the day, all the policies are bad. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=128.32s)]
*  They're taking this country in the wrong direction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=130.44s)]
*  So when people talk about the word salad, in the wrestling business, we call it a bunch [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=132.74s)]
*  of gaga, you know? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=136.56s)]
*  And it just doesn't mean anything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=137.92s)]
*  So when you talk to Trump, you got a feeling, you know, that he's real, he's tangible, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  he connects with the American people, and he loves this country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=145.1s)]
*  I've known the guy since WrestleMania 4 and 5 almost 40 years ago. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=148.12s)]
*  He hasn't changed a bit. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=152.4s)]
*  He's the same generous, honest guy he was back then. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=154.2s)]
*  He loves this country, he loves life, and he loves his family. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=157.8s)]
*  And when he talks about bringing God back into our homes and back to our country and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=161.0s)]
*  back to our schools, the people understand he's for real. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=165.56s)]
*  He's sincere about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=168.96s)]
*  What do you make of the Nazi, fascist, racist closing argument, the psychotic rage that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=171.32s)]
*  has now overtaken the Joy campaign? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=177.32s)]
*  Well, there's a clip that you didn't show, and when I went on stage, I said, no, this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=179.6s)]
*  is the house that Hulkamania built, or whatever I said, and this is Trumpmania. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=186.44s)]
*  I can't remember what I said, but I looked around, 22,000 people, and I said, I don't [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=189.44s)]
*  see no stinking Nazis in here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't see any domestic terrorists. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  I just see hardworking people, men and women, that love this country, that want safety, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  security, they want to be, how would I say, be able to pay their bills and get along in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  life and just have a good life in God and country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Just good American, real American people in the building. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  What they're saying is just spewing venom. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=217.32s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=219.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  The people that get up every morning, they work hard, obey the laws, they raise their [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=222.04s)]
*  kids, they take them to church, they cook dinner, pay their taxes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=226.6s)]
*  I mean, they're the people that really make the country great. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=232.36s)]
*  They're the people—that's been your audience your entire career. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=235.0s)]
*  That's been my audience my entire career. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=238.64s)]
*  Our lives are because of very generous people that have blessed us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=241.48s)]
*  I hate to see the American dream that we have both benefited from disintegrating before [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=246.0s)]
*  our very eyes, and there's not a single thing they can point to that they can say [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  is successful, in my view. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=256.32s)]
*  Well, when I was talking to the president the other night in the back, I told him, I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=258.8s)]
*  don't buy these polls. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=264.32s)]
*  I mean, I've been pushing, slinging this real American beer for four months. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=265.32s)]
*  I've gone to 18 different states. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=269.76s)]
*  I'm pushing through all 50. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=271.76s)]
*  When my fans are Democrats and they're Republicans, I see 8,000 to 10,000 people a day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=273.64s)]
*  I take pictures, sign autographs. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=278.76s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, they're all for Donald Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's so lopsided. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=284.28s)]
*  Middle America is so lopsided, it's unbelievable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  But what you read in the press, demonizing President Trump, saying we're all domestic [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  terrorists, talking about the Nazi stuff, none of that stuff is true. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  And I told Donald Trump, I can't even buy into these polls. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  And when he says it's too big to rig, that's exactly where this is at now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=301.56s)]
*  I gotta order your beer online. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  I have less than a minute. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=308.84s)]
*  What is it about that iconic arena? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=310.88s)]
*  What is it about MSG? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=312.78s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=314.52s)]
*  Well, it's like the Roman Coliseum. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=315.52s)]
*  If you're an athlete, if you make it in Madison Square Garden, you've made it in your career [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=318.76s)]
*  as far as athletics. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the fact that I was in Madison Square Garden for almost 40 years, when I walked [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  out there the other night and I saw 22,000 people, it was the energy of hulkamania. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=330.14s)]
*  But it was even bigger. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=335.78s)]
*  It was like all the Trump maniacs were all on the same team. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=336.78s)]
*  We all want to make America great again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=340.3s)]
*  And I was kind of worried going out there because I usually have another guy to work [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=342.52s)]
*  with out there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=345.34s)]
*  I was out there by myself and I felt like everybody was with me because we were all [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=346.34s)]
*  on the same team. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=350.78s)]
*  We were on Trump's team, brother. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=351.78s)]
*  And those Trumpomaniacs, those are real Americans. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=353.74s)]
*  They want this country back, brother. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=356.58s)]
*  Bill Kogan, don't as the Washington Post said, the American people should not settle [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=360.02s)]
*  for a townhouse instead of a home with the yard. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZO2e2WAYC0&t=367.35999999999996s)]
