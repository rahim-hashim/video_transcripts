# Sen. Rand Paul: Millions of dollars are being spent on 'magic'
**Fox News:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0)
*  Donald Trump's Department of Government efficiency can't come fast enough. Now, listen to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=0.0s)]
*  latest example of a government waste, fraud, abuse. Now, back in 2022, remember Joe Biden, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=7.0s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act, they paid a defense contractor a whopping $3 billion taxpayer [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=13.8s)]
*  dollars to manufacture all electric mail delivery trucks for the postal service. Now, so far, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=20.84s)]
*  the company has built a grand total of 93 trucks. It was supposed to build 60,000. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=28.6s)]
*  93 trucks in two years, all from a defense contractor, get this, who's never built mail [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=35.72s)]
*  trucks before. Now, of course, it's not the only example of the past four years. The administration [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=42.92s)]
*  allocated $7.5 billion to build electric vehicle charging stations. So far, they've built a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  whopping 226 of them. They also spent $5 billion on electric school buses. Turns out most of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=57.04s)]
*  them were built with Chinese materials, and the administration won't even say how many [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  of them are even on the road. And as Trump and Republicans now move to get back to constitutional [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=70.28s)]
*  order, limited government, greater freedom, cut wasteful government spending, they are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=76.52s)]
*  about to get some ideas from the annual Festivus list that's released by Kentucky Senator [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=81.84s)]
*  Rand Paul, and he joins us now with the preview. All right, can you explain this to me? So [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=88.28s)]
*  they're supposed to build 60,000 electric vehicle postal delivery vehicles. Okay, they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=94.64s)]
*  build a whopping 93. And then they spend $7.5 billion for these charging stations, and we've [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=102.68s)]
*  got a whopping 226, and the school bus is just as bad. Senator, what the hell are they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=110.7s)]
*  doing? My joke is, my joke is when they finally get the charging stations up and running, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=119.34s)]
*  someone's going to go in there with their car and say, oh no, they have the wrong plug. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=125.38s)]
*  It doesn't fit. We can't charge our car here. Government is incompetent, and we should keep [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=128.7s)]
*  government out of everything they do unless nobody else will do it. But you're right, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=133.1s)]
*  we're going to be celebrating Festivus on December 23rd. It's the day of, in which we [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=138.3s)]
*  air our grievances. I will air my grievances towards big spenders of both parties. We will [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  talk about electric charging stations, electric cars, but we'll also be talking about government [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=149.86s)]
*  funding for ice skating drag queens. We'll be talking about taxpayer funded magic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=155.38000000000002s)]
*  Slow down. Can I, let me stop you there. Ice skating. All right. How much money are we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=162.66s)]
*  spending on ice skating drag queens? How much, how many, how many harder and taxpayer dollars [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  on that? I can tell you, I can tell you the total will be in the hundreds of billions [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=175.42s)]
*  for the entire Festivus report. I don't have the breakdown on each individual one, but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=180.82s)]
*  I can tell you that there are millions of dollars being spent on magic. I can tell [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=185.42s)]
*  you that there are also going to be some money for the southern border, but not the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=191.26s)]
*  southern border of the United States, for the southern border of Paraguay. So, you know, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=196.5s)]
*  we fund small businesses everywhere. One of my favorites was when they decided that they [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  would spend a million dollars studying what happens to Japanese quail. Are they more sexually [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  promiscuous when you give them cocaine? This is tough. You can't make it up, but it's both [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=213.98s)]
*  parties and I will bear my grievances with both parties on this. That was about a million [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=220.38000000000002s)]
*  bucks. They used to be, we, citizens against government waste, I think is the name of the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=226.5s)]
*  group. I mean, this is madness. Now on a serious note here, I do like the idea of Elon Musk [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=231.34s)]
*  and Vivek Ramaswamy and they're volunteering. They're not getting paid to do this, but they're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=240.46s)]
*  going to find, they think they can find $2 trillion in government waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=246.02s)]
*  I have always believed that our framers and our founders wanted limited government, greater [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=252.9s)]
*  freedom, not a womb to the tomb, cradle to grave utopia that always ends in failure and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=260.06s)]
*  unfulfilled promises of more poverty and a loss of freedom. So are we going to get to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=266.78s)]
*  that point? You know, I'm helping Doge. I talked to Vivek weekly. I've sent him 2000 [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=271.9s)]
*  pages of waste that we've already discovered. But one thing you have to remember, and I [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  know you know this, that it's a bipartisan problem in the sense that last year they passed [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=283.9s)]
*  a chips subsidy bill. This is a bill where they're giving billions of dollars to big [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=288.78s)]
*  companies like Intel and other people that make chips. But in it, they doubled the size [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  of the National Science Foundation from 4 billion to 8 billion. Where does most of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=298.3s)]
*  crazy studies that I point out, the studies about if you sneeze on the food, are you more [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  or less likely to eat that food? That one costs $2 million. They come from the National [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  Science Foundation and Republicans and Democrats got together last year and doubled the size [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=313.86s)]
*  of the department. So we have to have more pressure on Republicans. We won't get any [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  Democrat votes. We have to have more pressure on the big government Republicans to vote [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=325.34s)]
*  for the things that Doge will bring forward and also the things that I've been bringing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=330.14s)]
*  forward for nearly a decade. Yeah, unbelievable. Senator, thanks for what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=334.5s)]
*  you're doing. I mean, some of this is funny, but it's not funny when you consider how hard [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=340.14s)]
*  the American people have to work to pay a billion dollars in taxes. And you know, they, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=345.82s)]
*  spend this money frivolously and you know what, Americans need their money back and we do have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=352.06s)]
*  to pay down the debt and we do have to fund social security, Medicare. You know, they're both headed [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=357.26s)]
*  towards insolvency. And by the way, we do need to build up our military because we do have a gap of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=363.98s)]
*  vulnerability. This is unreal. Anyway, Senator, Merry Christmas. Have a great party on the 23rd. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvAxSGGUfG0&t=369.1s)]
