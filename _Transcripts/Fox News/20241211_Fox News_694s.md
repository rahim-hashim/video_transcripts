# Judge Jeanine: Daniel Penny was a hero
**Fox News:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU)
*  These public officials would do something so self-serving. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=0.0s)]
*  But how does it serve them to hurt you? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=9.0s)]
*  Just political gain. I mean, these are their policies that are—and I don't mean to get political. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=12.0s)]
*  I don't really want to make any enemies, really, although I guess I have already. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=18.0s)]
*  But I mean, these are their policies that have clearly not worked, that the people, the general population, are not in support of yet. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=26.0s)]
*  Their egos are too big just to admit that they're wrong. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=35.0s)]
*  Again, the full interview will air tomorrow on FoxNation.com, here with a preview. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=40.0s)]
*  She is the co-host of the hit show, The Five, our friend Judge Jeanine Pirro. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=45.0s)]
*  Judge, first let me compliment you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=51.0s)]
*  Your coverage on a daily basis of this trial in the middle of an election season was nothing short of some of the greatest work you've done. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=53.0s)]
*  I know this is your wheelhouse. You've been a DA. You've been a prosecutor. You've been a victim's rights advocate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=62.0s)]
*  This was a clear case of self-defense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=69.0s)]
*  You had witness after witness testify that they felt that their life was in jeopardy based on the actions and the words of Mr. Neely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=72.0s)]
*  and Daniel Penny was a good Samaritan, put his own life at risk, and they put him through all of this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=80.0s)]
*  It's pretty unbelievable. What was your take on him? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just say one thing about those people who are out there yelling for black vigilantism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=90.0s)]
*  I want to know where is Alvin Bragg? Where is Latisha James? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=101.0s)]
*  Where are these prosecutors when you've got a situation where they're literally threatening to kill someone? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=106.0s)]
*  They're nowhere to be found. It's all about ideology. It's not about reality. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=113.0s)]
*  And then when you have the women on the view who come out and say, you know, this is wrong and that's wrong and, you know, this is murder. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=118.0s)]
*  Are you kidding me? The laws in New York are very clear. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=124.0s)]
*  Justification is allowed. If you are confronted with deadly physical force, you can then use deadly physical force, although he did not. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=128.0s)]
*  He did not use deadly physical force. What he did was he was in a position to see that everyone was frozen on that subway car. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=138.0s)]
*  There was a threat to kill a man capable of imminent deadly physical force. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=148.0s)]
*  He made the decision when he took out those earbuds and he told the guy next to him to hold his phone that he was going to help other people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=154.0s)]
*  He didn't say, let me go to another car or let me just get off the subway as soon as it stops. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=162.0s)]
*  He held him down until the police came. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=168.0s)]
*  And what this man died of was sickle cell, psychosis, the stress, the K2 and all of the other things that were going on in his body. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=171.0s)]
*  But this guy that you're looking at right now, Danny Penny, is one of the most decent human beings that I have met in my life. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=181.0s)]
*  He wants no praise. He wants no one to consider him a hero. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=189.0s)]
*  He was willing to go through a thousand days of these trials and these attacks because he couldn't live with himself if he didn't stand up for the women and the children on that subway car. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=194.0s)]
*  And by the way, he was right. He said to the police when he voluntarily went to see them, he said he seemed like he was on K2, which we know is something that makes an aggressor even more aggressive. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=207.0s)]
*  And what he didn't know was that this guy, Jordan Neely, had 42 arrests in seven years, that he was on a list of the 50 most mentally ill and homeless, dangerous people in New York City in a city of 8 million people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=220.0s)]
*  So let's try to get to the bottom line here. And that is we've got a hero and people who needed to be protected. And he was that guy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=236.0s)]
*  And the jury did not get to hear all of that information that you put out. Let me go back to your interview and where he said that Neely was threatening to kill people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=246.0s)]
*  You just identified the law and then saying that he would have felt guilty if someone in the subway got hurt. Let's listen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=257.0s)]
*  What in you caused you to want to get involved? I mean, I'm not a confrontational person. I don't really extend myself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=266.0s)]
*  I think this type of thing is very uncomfortable. All this attention and limelight is very uncomfortable. And I would prefer without it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=275.0s)]
*  I didn't want any type of attention or praise. And I still don't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=285.0s)]
*  The guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, would never be able to live with myself. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=294.0s)]
*  And I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=305.0s)]
*  He was just threatening to kill people. He was threatening to go to jail forever, go to jail for the rest of his life. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=321.0s)]
*  And now where I'm on the ground with him, I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position. If I just would have let go, now he turns. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=329.0s)]
*  Why is that a vulnerable position? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=339.0s)]
*  Well, if I just let him go, I'm on my back. Now he can just turn around and start doing what he said to me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=342.0s)]
*  Killing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=349.0s)]
*  Killing, hurting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=351.0s)]
*  Pretty amazing, Judge. When you get to the law, if everybody testifies, every witness says pretty much the same thing, that they felt their life was in jeopardy, that then therefore triggers justifiable use of force. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=353.0s)]
*  Then we had a DA, you know, who never should have brought this case in the first place. Then we had a hung jury on the manslaughter charge. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=370.0s)]
*  Then, according to New York law, if you don't get a verdict, the entire case should then be thrown out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=379.0s)]
*  But no, they went for a compromise verdict, which brings more corruption into Alvin Bragg's office. What do you make of all of that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=387.0s)]
*  Look, Alvin Bragg's office did everything they could to put Danny Penny in jail. The police did not arrest him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=397.0s)]
*  It was ten days later that they decided to indict him, and that's after Al Sharpton came in and everybody said this case is about race. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=404.0s)]
*  And Alvin Bragg's office should be criticized for the fact that they tried to make it about race. I want you to remember a couple of things. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=411.0s)]
*  Number one, there were minorities on that jury. Number two, there was a Hispanic and a black who assisted Danny in holding down Jordan Neely. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=418.0s)]
*  And number three, on the subway car, the people who were black, Hispanic and white. So nothing about this was racial. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=429.0s)]
*  But they wanted to make this about race. This case was not about race. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=439.0s)]
*  This was a case where the DA's office did everything they could, including when this case should have been dismissed, a mistrial. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=443.0s)]
*  They decided to dismiss the top count, hoping the jury would come back on Monday and compromise on a crim-neg homicide. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=453.0s)]
*  They didn't do that. Alvin Bragg's office tried to weaponize Danny Penny's military service against him, as though the fact that he was a Marine, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=459.0s)]
*  the fact that he did what he was taught, that he used his knowledge of how to defend people from other people to protect people, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=469.0s)]
*  they tried to make that a negative. And so people in the military should stand and salute this guy. Law enforcement should stand and salute this guy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=480.0s)]
*  And Alvin Bragg should be investigated by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice for his trying to politicize, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=490.0s)]
*  as well as violate the civil rights of Danny Penny based on a make-believe racial pretext. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=499.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, I'd be negligent if I didn't talk about the United Healthcare CEO, Thompson, and the people on the left that are joyful and happy and celebratory. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=508.0s)]
*  And, you know, all right, I understand sometimes people have frustration with an insurance company, but this was an assassination. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=521.0s)]
*  Are you as shocked as I am at the left's reaction to this assassination? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=530.0s)]
*  It is mind-boggling. But, you know, Sean, we are just coming out of a long period of this leftist progressive nonsense. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=536.0s)]
*  I was going to say BS. And there are still people who believe in it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=547.0s)]
*  And, you know, you even have people who supposedly know the law, like, you know, AOC and some of the people on The View. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=552.0s)]
*  They don't know the law. They don't care about it. But let's talk about the healthcare system in this country. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=561.0s)]
*  You want to complain about it. You're justified if you feel you've been wrong. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=567.0s)]
*  But, you know, you ought to try the healthcare system in some of these other countries. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=571.0s)]
*  Try going to Canada. And, you know, try going to other countries where you can't even get to a doctor. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=575.0s)]
*  And let's talk about the fact that this government is spending so much money on the healthcare for illegals [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=581.0s)]
*  when we should be using that money to help Americans. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=588.0s)]
*  So, I mean, it's like these people are ignorant. They're ignorant of the reality. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=592.0s)]
*  And this kid, he grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth, and he's so angry. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=598.0s)]
*  I mean, if you've got an issue, you can sue. But this is beyond the pale. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=604.0s)]
*  And I'm telling you right now, Sean, the American people on November 5th, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=608.0s)]
*  they decided they're going to take this country on a different track with Donald Trump. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=612.0s)]
*  It's going to be about law and order. It's going to be about loving America and not hating America. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=616.0s)]
*  It's going to be about respecting our borders. All of this will change. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=621.0s)]
*  And to me, at the pinnacle of this is Danny Penny, who paid a terrible price [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=625.0s)]
*  for this progressive left politicized prosecution and is man enough to say, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=631.0s)]
*  I'll do it again. I don't want people hurt. And the guy wants no attention, Sean. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=637.0s)]
*  This was very hard for him. And I have to compliment his mother and his father for raising a phenomenal human being. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=644.0s)]
*  I would be negligent if I didn't ask. Will he go after Alvin Bragg for malicious prosecution? I've got to run. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=652.0s)]
*  I doubt it. That's not who Danny Penny is. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=661.0s)]
*  Judge, you did a phenomenal job, not just in the interview. It was great, very compelling. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=667.0s)]
*  We'll watch the entire interview on Fox Nation, but more importantly, your entire coverage of the case. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=672.0s)]
*  Anyway, tomorrow on FoxNation.com. You don't want to miss it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL9chXbj_BU&t=677.0s)]
