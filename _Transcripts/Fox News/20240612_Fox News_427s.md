# Miranda Devine on Hunter Biden laptop: 'They knew it wasn't Russian disinfo'
**Fox News:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw)
*  All right, talk about bad timing. After Hunter's guilty verdict, the White House promptly canceled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=0.0s)]
*  the daily press briefing and announced Joe would be headed to Delaware tonight to, quote, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=4.4s)]
*  be with family. But not before Joe had to give a speech to a gun control group. Imagine having [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=9.92s)]
*  to talk about gun control right after your own son is convicted of federal gun crimes. Well, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=16.72s)]
*  Joe took the easy way out. He never mentioned Hunter once, spent most of his speech going [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  after America's law-abiding gun owners and Donald Trump. In fact, the only Hunter Joe mentioned [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=27.44s)]
*  is one he meant campaigning in Delaware decades ago. Who knows if it's true? Maybe an Uncle Bozie [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=34.08s)]
*  moment. The cannibal guy. Take a look. I mean this. I know it's hard because I've gotten those phone [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=41.2s)]
*  calls too saying I lost a son, a daughter, a wife. I know what it's like. We're not stopping there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  It's time once again to do what I did when I was a senator. Ban assault weapons. He said, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=53.04s)]
*  what do you mean I need that done? I said, guess what? If you need 12 to 100 bullets in a gun in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=59.44s)]
*  a magazine, you're the lousiest shot I've ever heard. My predecessor told the NRA convention [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=65.84s)]
*  recently, he's proud that, quote, I did nothing on guns when I was president. And by doing nothing, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=70.96s)]
*  he made the situation considerably worse. How much do you hear of this phrase? The blood of liberty. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=77.36s)]
*  Wash of dough. Give me a break. No, I mean it. Seriously. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=84.08s)]
*  And by the way, if they want to think to take on government if we get out of line, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=92.24s)]
*  which they're talking again about, well guess what? They need F-15s. They don't need a rifle. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=96.88s)]
*  Folks, look, this is crazy what we're talking about. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  And President Obama, then Vice President Biden, they did nothing to stop violence, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=107.44s)]
*  gun violence in Chicago and other big cities. Anyway, here with reaction to the day's news, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Miranda Devine of the New York Post and former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Well, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=117.36s)]
*  the laptop from hell, you, our friend Emma Jo Morris, you guys were right the whole time, Miranda. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=123.28s)]
*  And to me, the verdict is, it was the right verdict. The evidence was overwhelming. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=131.2s)]
*  But the bigger story is the government introducing that laptop into evidence. And that means all the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  other contents in that laptop are now meaningful as it relates to the law and Joe and Hunter Biden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=145.28s)]
*  Would you agree? Absolutely. And the fact that the Joe Biden, the Biden campaign, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=151.6s)]
*  the CIA, the FBI, those 51 former intelligence officials went to such lengths to lie about the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=160.08s)]
*  laptop. Big Tech censored the New York Post when we wrote about the laptop and the contents of it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=168.08s)]
*  What that shows you is that they were absolutely terrified about the contents of the laptop [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=174.16s)]
*  because they knew that it would be so damaging to Joe Biden that it would wreck his campaign. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=180.48s)]
*  And they successfully managed to suppress the story. And as you said earlier, that amounted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=187.52s)]
*  to election interference. And that is why none of those 51, you saw James Clapper the other day, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=194.4s)]
*  you've seen others of them, they all refused to admit that they lied, that if they were wrong, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  that they had zero evidence that it was Russian disinformation. They knew it wasn't Russian [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=206.4s)]
*  disinformation. The FBI had had the laptop since December 2019. It was well known within the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=211.36s)]
*  intelligence community that that information was real. And yet if they admit that they knew it [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  wasn't Russian disinformation, they are admitting that they were part of an election interference, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  a coup really, to ensure that the president, Donald Trump, didn't win a second term. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=232.4s)]
*  It really comes down to that, doesn't it? Now that we know all of this, Pam Bondi, we know also [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=238.24s)]
*  that Merrick Garland, DOJ, the FBI, they've all known this for four years. There's a lot of other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=246.0s)]
*  information, damning information on that laptop. It implicates Joe, it implicates Hunter, it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=254.16s)]
*  implicates the brother, it implicates all these other people. They've had this evidence. They [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=260.0s)]
*  haven't done a thing with this evidence. What's your reaction to that, which to me is the much [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=265.68s)]
*  bigger story here? It sure is, Sean. And I'm glad, I am glad they got a conviction on this because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=270.88s)]
*  now they can use the gun conviction in the tax charges, the only charges that are currently [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=277.36s)]
*  left against Hunter Biden, because the cases in 2014 and 2015, of course, the statute of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=282.8s)]
*  limitations had run. They let it run about dealing with foreign agents. The cases that could most [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  likely implicate James Biden, Joe Biden, the entire Biden family, they let those run. But now [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=294.56s)]
*  they're faced with the tax charges. Let's see what happens. Let's see if there's not a plea deal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=301.84s)]
*  I think there probably will be at this point because of this conviction. But yeah, thanks to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=305.92s)]
*  Miranda, thanks to great reporting, everyone now knows that the laptop from hell, as she says, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=310.96s)]
*  is real and everything on it is real, including all the other incriminating evidence that could [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=317.52s)]
*  be great for prosecutors. Well, what about Garland? He's had this information, this damning [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=323.2s)]
*  information. They all knew that Joe lied about, I never talked to my son, my brother or anybody [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  about their foreign business deals. And what about leveraging a billion dollars so his son [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  continues to get paid? What about the money they're getting from a former Russian oligarch? What [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  about meeting that oligarch in Cafe Milano? What about calling into all the meetings? What about [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  the millions of dollars the family's raking in? Hunter has no experience in energy, oil, gas, coal, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=350.56s)]
*  Ukraine or China. How does he make it all that money while he's addicted to drugs? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=356.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. And remember, President Trump asked that simple question of President [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=362.8s)]
*  Zelensky. And look what happened. They tried to impeach him over it. And President Trump was, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=367.2s)]
*  of course, right all along. Yeah. Merrick Garland is our chief law enforcement officer [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=371.6s)]
*  in this entire country. You know, we talk about the weaponization of the FBI, the CIA, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=376.64s)]
*  ATF now, the IRS. Well, it all starts at the top with Merrick Garland. He has to respond to this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=381.76s)]
*  He has to be held accountable. This is way too important for the American people. And our justice [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  system is at stake, Sean. Well, Miranda, maybe now your book Laptop from Hell will be a bestseller [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=393.76s)]
*  again. And people can now look a little more deeply now that finally the government four years [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=402.16s)]
*  later has confirmed that which you and Emma Jo and others reported way back when. All right. Thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITaDug_Zqjw&t=407.04s)]
