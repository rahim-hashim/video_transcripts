# 'GOD'S WORK': Trump negotiator gives pivotal update on Hamas hostages
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg)
*  All right, joining us now with reaction, incoming special envoy for the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's negotiating with him as we speak. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=4.16s)]
*  Steve Witkoff is back with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Steve, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=8.0s)]
*  Let's start with what the president said. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=9.72s)]
*  Look, all hell will break loose if those hostages are not back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=12.44s)]
*  He was talking to you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=17.0s)]
*  You were in that picture. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=18.36s)]
*  I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=19.76s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break loose in the Middle [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=22.36s)]
*  East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=27.96s)]
*  You're talking to them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=29.36s)]
*  The one thing I think the world believes, if Donald Trump says it, he means it, how [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=31.52s)]
*  are those negotiations going? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=37.72s)]
*  Well, I think they're going well, Sean. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=40.24s)]
*  First of all, thanks for having me this evening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=44.4s)]
*  I think they're going well, but I would also tell you that it's the president's strong [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=46.36s)]
*  stance, his certitude in asserting that all hell will break loose, that is moving people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=52.4s)]
*  I think we should have had a deal 10 days ago, candidly, but hopefully we've got some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=63.4s)]
*  people really doing God's work at that negotiating table. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=70.2s)]
*  The Sheikh of Sheikh Mohammed, the prime minister of Qatar, the Israelis are dug in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=75.16s)]
*  Everybody wants to see this happen, so I am hopeful it happens before the inauguration. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  And if it does happen, it'll be in large part because of the president's directive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=88.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=93.96s)]
*  So, you have a fairly high level of confidence that you can get the deal done? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=94.96s)]
*  You know, I don't know, maybe call it aspirational. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=102.64s)]
*  It's been going on for too long. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=106.08s)]
*  You have to agree with every—I agree with everything the president has said. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=108.84s)]
*  The hostages should never have been taken. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=114.28s)]
*  But you have these families that I talk to, the president talks to. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=116.16s)]
*  He doesn't refuse a single telephone call. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=119.44s)]
*  He gets on the phone with the families. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=122.2s)]
*  He's talking to them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=124.0s)]
*  It's harrowing to listen to it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=125.4s)]
*  And as you know, Sean, I lost a son. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=127.84s)]
*  I lost a child. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=130.92s)]
*  And so these parents think about this every single night when they go to sleep. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=132.4s)]
*  We have to get them home. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=136.36s)]
*  It's the American hostages. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=138.76s)]
*  It's all the hostages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=140.08s)]
*  They just don't—they're living in terrible conditions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=141.08s)]
*  And it's time for everybody to come back. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=144.08s)]
*  And by the way, there'll be plenty of Palestinians who will be released as a result of this, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=147.64s)]
*  and they'll go home to their families. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=152.12s)]
*  So I think this is something that the world needs to see. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=154.48s)]
*  We need this moment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=158.64s)]
*  One of the successes of Donald Trump's first term was he put together a coalition. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=162.48s)]
*  It was the U.S., it was Israel, it was the Saudis, it was the Emirates, it was Jordan, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=168.56s)]
*  it was Egypt, all standing against Iranian hegemony. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=173.76s)]
*  If you look at all of the proxy wars that are going on in the Middle East, they have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=178.4s)]
*  one common denominator, and that is Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  We keep reading that the Iranians and their radical mullahs are on the verge of getting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=186.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons, maybe three, four, five months away. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  To me, the world cannot risk them having those nuclear weapons. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=196.72s)]
*  Is that part of a strategy that has come up? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=202.88s)]
*  Well, we have all heard the president's position on nuclear. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=206.16s)]
*  He will not allow a bomb to be gotten by the Iranians. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=217.6s)]
*  We're not going to that place. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  We're not going to have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  I work for him, and I happen to believe in the policy, but it's his directive, and we're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=223.96s)]
*  going to implement that policy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=229.28s)]
*  Now, hopefully, hopefully, we can solve it diplomatically. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=230.84s)]
*  The president is all about solving it diplomatically, if that's possible, and if people are going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=235.36s)]
*  to adhere to their agreements. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  But if not, then the alternative is not necessarily a good one, but we're not going to allow any [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=243.96s)]
*  weaponization happening out of Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=253.44s)]
*  God bless all the peace makers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=258.24s)]
*  All hell will break loose. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=260.44s)]
*  I hope they are hearing Trump loud and clear. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=262.56s)]
*  I can tell them with a hundred degree of certainty that he means what he says. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=265.64s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, Godspeed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=271.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5bNJeZNyg&t=272.36s)]
