# Sean Hannity: Biden is leaving behind a colossal mess
**Fox News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs)
*  But we start tonight on a high note. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=0.0s)]
*  Less than seven days, one week from today, Joe Biden will be out of the White House for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=2.22s)]
*  good. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=7.32s)]
*  At this time next week, Donald Trump will once again be the president of our country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=8.32s)]
*  Joe is leaving behind a colossal mess for President Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=12.34s)]
*  America's second-largest city is in ruins, more than 40,000 acres gone, filled with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=15.8s)]
*  homes and businesses and schools. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=21.5s)]
*  Entire communities burned to the ground. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=23.66s)]
*  We have a death toll now, 24, and going higher, over 12,000. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=25.94s)]
*  Structures, they have been destroyed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  And the fires, they continue to burn, completely out of control. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=32.52s)]
*  Water remains scarce or completely unavailable, finger-pointing and blame a running rampant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=36.56s)]
*  And last week, the L.A. Fire Department was sent out to battle the blaze without water. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=41.74s)]
*  Crucial fire hydrants, they were dry. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  A key reservoir was completely empty. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=49.96s)]
*  Taxpayer-funded reservoirs, five of them that were supposed to be built, the voters approved [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  of this in a referendum in 2014. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=58.68s)]
*  They were never built. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=61.2s)]
*  Nobody informed the firefighters. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=62.6s)]
*  Pleased by the police, the fire chief were completely ignored. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=64.6s)]
*  Firefighters' budget was cut. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=68.52s)]
*  Billions yet set aside for wind turbines. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=70.76s)]
*  Over $650 million federal state dollars allocated to make the port of Los Angeles green, whatever [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=73.92s)]
*  that means. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=80.62s)]
*  Nobody had a backup plan. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=81.92s)]
*  You know, nobody was ready to go. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=83.64s)]
*  Nobody had water tankers lined up to save these neighborhoods. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=86.6s)]
*  Nobody's taking responsibility. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=90.28s)]
*  Not the president, not the governor, not the mayor, not the fire chief. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=91.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Did the city of Los Angeles fail you and your department and our city? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  It's my job to stand up as a chief and exactly say, justifiably, what the fire department [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=101.36s)]
*  needs to operate to meet the demands of the community. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=108.32s)]
*  Did they fail you? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=111.12s)]
*  That is our job. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=112.48s)]
*  And I tell you, that's why I'm here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=113.48s)]
*  So let's get us what we need so our firefighters can do their jobs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=115.04s)]
*  Did they fail you? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=119.64s)]
*  The $17 million budget cut and elimination of our civilian positions, like our mechanics, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=120.64s)]
*  did and has and will continue to severely impact our ability to repair our apparatus. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=126.84s)]
*  Over the last three years, it's been clear that the fire department needs help. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=132.88s)]
*  We can no longer sustain where we are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=138.4s)]
*  We do not have enough firefighters. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  With that, I have also requested multiple budgets, interim budgets, to show how understaffed, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=144.2s)]
*  under-resourced and under-funded the LAFD is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=150.84s)]
*  Now, as the city's fire budget was just slashed by tens of millions of dollars, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=154.96s)]
*  city, the state, they spent lavishly on libraries, green energy boondoggles, social justice [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=160.76s)]
*  programs, DEI initiatives. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=166.72s)]
*  The state is a sanctuary state. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  LA is a sanctuary city, untold hundreds of millions of dollars spent on illegals for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=170.76s)]
*  their food, their housing, their healthcare, their education. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=176.92s)]
*  It is the highest tax state in the entire country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=180.12s)]
*  They were not prepared for what was a predictable wildfire with predictable Santa Ana winds. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=183.26s)]
*  But the California legislature, well, they did just pass a $50 million deal to Trump-proof [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=189.48s)]
*  the state of California. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=195.88s)]
*  It's a great way to ingratiate themselves to the new president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=197.0s)]
*  Gavin, great move. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=200.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, around LA, the dry brush was not managed at all. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  The science of forestry, you can get a degree in it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=206.16s)]
*  As we pointed out, it was ignored. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=209.28s)]
*  The fire department was short-staffed, preoccupied with equity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=211.32s)]
*  None of California's overpaid bureaucracy and political class, none of them did their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=215.8s)]
*  jobs. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=220.8s)]
*  Now, none of the city's critical fire infrastructure and emergency planning was properly tested. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  Now, the mayor, Karen Bass, was in Africa when the fire erupted, despite an earlier [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  forecast of heavy winds and the risk of wildfires and a promise she wouldn't travel as the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  mayor of Los Angeles. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=238.8s)]
*  The governor indicated it was not his problem. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=240.52s)]
*  This is local governments. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=243.36s)]
*  They need to figure out those fire hydrant things themselves. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  And yet again, the Biden administration was caught totally flat-footed, completely unprepared. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=248.04s)]
*  The people of California were failed by a Democratic mayor, a far-left bureaucracy, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=253.44s)]
*  a governor, a Democratic legislature, a Democratic president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=258.16s)]
*  And by the way, guess who in the end is going to end up paying for the rebuild? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=262.32s)]
*  You. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=265.8s)]
*  Mark my words. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=266.8s)]
*  And this is a Democratic president that can barely form a coherent thought, much less [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=268.08s)]
*  manage a major disaster. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=274.48s)]
*  We saw that with Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=276.32s)]
*  The people of North Carolina, they're still struggling to this day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=279.36s)]
*  He didn't seem to remember that Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in November. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=283.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=287.76s)]
*  Mr. President, do you regret your decision to run for reelection? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=288.76s)]
*  Do you think that that made it easier for your predecessor to now become your successor? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=292.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=296.96s)]
*  I think I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump, and I think that Kamala could [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=297.96s)]
*  have beaten Trump, would have beaten Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=305.24s)]
*  There's no other way to put this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=309.44s)]
*  Joe Biden is out of it, delusional, a cognitive mess. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  In fact, he just said with a straight face that illegal immigration came way down when [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=315.08s)]
*  he became president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=320.44s)]
*  Can't make it up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=321.44s)]
*  You decide. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  Look, let's get something in mind about the border. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  When I became president, the numbers came way down, number one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Number two, we had a circumstance where I pushed very hard for a bipartisan agreement [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  to put more people on the border, more, more, more secret service agents. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=338.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=345.24s)]
*  This is nowhere close to reality. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=346.5s)]
*  His border bill was an amnesty bill. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=348.48s)]
*  This is a complete total delusion on his part. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=354.44s)]
*  Take a look at the numbers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=355.44s)]
*  Remember that chart? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=356.44s)]
*  You might remember that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=357.44s)]
*  Butler, PA. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=358.44s)]
*  Massive spike, you know, on the right side of your screen. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=359.44s)]
*  Yeah, that would be Biden. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=363.08s)]
*  But the delusions, they don't stop there. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=365.12s)]
*  Today, Biden announced that America is stronger than ever and the world is a more peaceful [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=367.04s)]
*  place. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=372.4s)]
*  Maybe he don't, nobody told him there's war in Europe and war in the Middle East. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=373.4s)]
*  Maybe he forgot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Compared to four years ago, America is stronger. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Our alliances are stronger. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=383.76s)]
*  Our adversaries and competitors are weaker. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=386.04s)]
*  We have not gone to war to make these things happen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=388.96s)]
*  During my presidency, I've increased America's power at every dimension. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=392.64s)]
*  We increased our diplomatic power, creating more allies the United States has ever had [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  in the history of our nation. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=401.44s)]
*  Today, I can report to the American people, our adversaries are weaker than where we came [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=402.64s)]
*  into this job four years ago. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=407.88s)]
*  Just consider Russia. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he'd conquer Kiev in a matter of days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=412.58s)]
*  The truth is, since that war began, I'm the only one that stood in the center of Kiev, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  not him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay, beyond laughable, actually sad. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaupyftmFs&t=423.84000000000003s)]
