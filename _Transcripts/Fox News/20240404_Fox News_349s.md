# Ted Cruz: Biden views migrants flown to Texas as future Dem votes
**Fox News:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I)
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's swing state lead is likely bolstered by voters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=0.0s)]
*  who trust Trump more than Biden on the economy, inflation, immigration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=5.0s)]
*  Immigration again and again shows up as the number one issue on people's minds. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=10.02s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=14.0s)]
*  One thing I keep reading is not only are the Biden people signaling that they're going [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=18.52s)]
*  to target Florida. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=23.3s)]
*  I think their odds are very low. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=24.6s)]
*  That's my take. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=26.5s)]
*  But also your state of Texas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=28.0s)]
*  This has been a dream of the Democratic Party for a long time, knowing if they flip Texas, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=29.98s)]
*  it's probably game set match. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  It's over for a long time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=37.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  Look, Sean, that's exactly right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  We've got a battle nationally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  The polling numbers we're seeing nationally are encouraging, but it's close. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=44.46s)]
*  It's going to be a battle to see who shows up and who votes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=48.28s)]
*  And when it comes to Texas, Chuck Schumer has been explicit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=50.94s)]
*  He's coming after Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=54.78s)]
*  I'm his number one target in the entire country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  I'm on the ballot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=58.98s)]
*  I'm running for reelection and the Democrats are coming after me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=59.98s)]
*  They are going to spend more than one hundred million dollars this year. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  George Soros is already spending millions of dollars in the state of Texas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=68.02s)]
*  My opponent, a liberal Democrat named Colin Allred, is out raising Beto O'Rourke, my last [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=72.36s)]
*  opponent, three to one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  They are flooding millions of dollars into Texas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  And the reason is simple. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=83.36s)]
*  You remember my last reelect. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=84.36s)]
*  It was a three point race. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=86.08s)]
*  I won by two point six percent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=87.18s)]
*  And so Chuck Schumer, his view is he floods millions into Texas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  He gains three points and that's how they win. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=93.56s)]
*  And I'll tell you how we're fighting back against it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  You've got the Democrat fat catch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=98.78s)]
*  You've got big tech. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=100.42s)]
*  You've got celebrities writing checks to my opponent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=101.42s)]
*  We're supported by millions of Americans, millions of conservatives all across this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  country that go to our website. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=108.4s)]
*  It's Ted Cruz dot org. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=110.48s)]
*  They go to Ted Cruz dot org. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=111.64000000000001s)]
*  They give twenty five bucks or fifty bucks or a hundred bucks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=113.34s)]
*  That's how we stand up to the George Soros and the Chuck Schumers and the Mark Zuckerbergs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=116.5s)]
*  is the twenty five and fifty bucks at Ted Cruz dot org because we got to fight to defend [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=120.86s)]
*  Texas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=126.1s)]
*  If we lose Texas, we lose the whole country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=127.16s)]
*  By the way, I was there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=130.7s)]
*  I was on the ground. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=131.7s)]
*  I was covering your race at the time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=132.7s)]
*  I remember it was that close and I remember many a conversation we had at the time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=134.06s)]
*  It's amazing how fast six years go by. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=139.78s)]
*  But I don't think they're going to succeed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=143.46s)]
*  And I'll tell you why, because Texas, more than any other state, has had to deal with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=145.5s)]
*  Biden's disaster at the border. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=151.66s)]
*  You have been in the forefront. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=154.46s)]
*  Governor Abbott has been in the forefront of fighting. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=156.14s)]
*  I don't know how you felt when I read that now they're flying people direct. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=158.94s)]
*  You don't have to pass go collect 200 bucks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=163.2s)]
*  You don't have to make the the the difficult trip to our border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=165.86s)]
*  Now they're just flying people in directly with American taxpayer money from whatever [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  country they're coming from, you know, to whatever state they want to go to. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  But they're targeting Florida and Texas and dropping and dumping 90 percent of these illegal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  immigrants in your state and now my state. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, let's be clear. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=189.48s)]
*  The 10.4 million illegal immigrants that Joe Biden and the Democrats have led in have deliberately [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  led in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=197.88s)]
*  They're letting them in because they view them as future Democrat voters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=198.88s)]
*  They hope as many of them as possible will vote illegally right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=202.28s)]
*  They want them to stay in Texas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=205.72s)]
*  They want them to be in Florida because they want to flip our states. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, if they bring a million illegal immigrants into Texas and they vote Democrat, Texas is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=210.16s)]
*  in real trouble. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=214.56s)]
*  And that's what the Democrats are aiming at. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=215.56s)]
*  It's why they're flooding our state. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=217.56s)]
*  And I got to say, you know, the point you just made, you're right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=220.0s)]
*  It's not just the invasion every day at the southern border of thousands upon thousands [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=222.84s)]
*  of people coming. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=227.88s)]
*  The Biden administration is literally flying people in from Venezuela, from Cuba, from [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=229.2s)]
*  Haiti. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=235.0s)]
*  Last year, 320,000 people, the Biden administration flew from their countries to America. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=236.28s)]
*  They flew them to over 40 different airports in America. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=242.0s)]
*  They won't tell us which ones, but you want to know the consequences. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=245.04s)]
*  We saw just two weeks ago a tragic story about a Haitian that the Biden administration flew [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=248.22s)]
*  in from Haiti. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=254.04s)]
*  They flew him to Boston, Massachusetts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=255.36s)]
*  And just two weeks ago, he was arrested for brutally raping a 15 year old girl who's severely [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=258.32s)]
*  disabled. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  This is what the Biden administration is doing is literally bringing criminals to our communities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's Texas, it's Florida, and it's every other state in the union. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=272.44s)]
*  You know, I've said this before, Senator. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=276.92s)]
*  I said this is a tipping point. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=280.2s)]
*  This is an inflection point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=282.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=283.6s)]
*  We've ever been more concerned about our country, borders, the economy, law and order, America's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  place in the world, war in Europe, war in the Middle East, things heating up even more [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=291.8s)]
*  every day, a new axis of evil. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  These are consequential times. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=299.88s)]
*  This will be a consequential election and we will live with the government we vote for. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, and you know what makes that perfectly clear? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  The Democrat Party abandoning Israel, Chuck Schumer demanding the elected leader of Israel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=311.48s)]
*  step down, Joe Biden orchestrating the United Nation to effectively condemn Israel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=316.92s)]
*  That's never happened before. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=321.92s)]
*  It's how radical they're getting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=323.36s)]
*  If you want Israel to stand and stand with America's support, we got to win in November. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=324.68s)]
*  That means Donald Trump needs to win. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  It also means I need your support in Texas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  So please come to Ted Cruz.org and let's fight to pull this country back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAKPaFIN4I&t=333.20000000000005s)]
