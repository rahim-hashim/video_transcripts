# Sean Hannity: Voters heard confusion from Biden
**Fox News:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY)
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight, Democrats, they are in complete panic mode. The media [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=0.0s)]
*  mob, they're pretty hysterical. And talk of mutiny inside the Democratic Party is now [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=6.68s)]
*  widespread. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=12.26s)]
*  We are one day removed from the first 2024 presidential debate. It did not go well for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=13.26s)]
*  Joe Biden. It went very well for Donald Trump. In fact, many analysts, including myself, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=18.92s)]
*  believe that for Joe Biden, this was the single worst debate performance in American televised [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=24.12s)]
*  presidential debate history. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=30.8s)]
*  Now, here's a Politico headline, quote, Democrats really have no way to spin Biden's disastrous [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=32.52s)]
*  debate. And another, quote, WTF panic them start looking for alternatives to Biden. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=39.2s)]
*  Here's an actual headline from Fake News CNN. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=48.04s)]
*  We are effed. Democrats despair over Biden debate performance. Don't blame me for the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=51.12s)]
*  language. Anyway, everyone watching last night witnessed what? A weak, frail, mentally impaired [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  man with a very poor memory. They saw the thousand yard stare, open mouth, glossy eyes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=63.22s)]
*  They heard confusion, muttering, trouble with numbers and names and concepts. In other words, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  In post debate, well, we saw Biden struggle to get down three or four stairs, getting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  off the debate stage with his wife, helping him every single step of the way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=82.84s)]
*  Now, a few minutes later, the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, led a cringe worthy post debate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=87.68s)]
*  rally while her husband, the president, stared off into space like he did all during the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=92.72s)]
*  debate. Take a look. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=98.12s)]
*  Joe, you did such a great job. You answered every question. You knew all the facts. And [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=99.12s)]
*  let me ask the crowd, what did Trump do? Why? Yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=106.12s)]
*  Joey, you did it. You did good. You answered every question and everything. I guess love [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=118.92s)]
*  Joe Biden clearly is not well, but this isn't some kind of breaking news revelation here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=124.7s)]
*  Biden has obviously been in a very steep cognitive decline for years as we have been reporting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=132.34s)]
*  on this show over and over and over again since before he was president. As a matter [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=138.46s)]
*  of fact, we got criticized often for doing so. You might remember. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=146.1s)]
*  It's not just as terrible record and it's hard left turn. Add to that as well. Let's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=152.94s)]
*  be honest, cognitive struggles that are now more than a little concerning. So obviously [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=157.5s)]
*  having cognitive issues, that's being polite. Every hostile regime in the world sadly knows [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=163.14s)]
*  that Joe is weak and frail. And they also know what all of you know, that he's a cognitive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=169.24s)]
*  mess, unfortunately. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=175.38s)]
*  And you might remember when I started talking about Joey gets a good night bedtime story [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=177.1s)]
*  and warm milky and sippy cup. Remember that? That was 2021. You know, we were only stating [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=182.9s)]
*  the obvious. Biden's poor performance last night was not anything new. It was not out [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  of the ordinary. We show it to you almost every night. We saw this every single week, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  speech and yet for years, the state run media mob, their friends in the Democratic Party, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=203.66s)]
*  they're saying this is a conspiracy theory. As of a few days ago, what were they claiming? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=210.22s)]
*  Oh, that's right. Unedited videos of Biden. These are cheap, fake videos. No, they were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=215.7s)]
*  real. Take a look at your screen. Here's the New York Times on the left. They call [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=222.66s)]
*  videos of Biden struggles, quote, misleading. That was last week on the right, at least [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=227.02s)]
*  four headlines after the debate begging Joe to drop out because of his cognitive decline. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=232.74s)]
*  But it wasn't just the New York Times. Here's MSN, DNC's liberal Joe, our old friend. Take [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  a look. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=246.78s)]
*  Start your tape right now, because I'm about to tell you the truth and F you if you can't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=248.46s)]
*  handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically is the best Biden ever. Not [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=253.54s)]
*  a close second. And I've known him for years. We saw last night why this race has been close [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=264.98s)]
*  and why I fear Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States unless things [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=273.5s)]
*  change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=280.86s)]
*  The best Biden ever. If you can't handle the truth, thank you. Joe, want to apologize [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=281.98s)]
*  for that? Anyway, I guess Democrats thought they were going to be lying their way into [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=289.06s)]
*  reelection. According to the left, according to the media mob, Biden was always on his [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=293.86s)]
*  game. They said Joe would accomplish more in one hour than most Americans do in an entire [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=299.06s)]
*  day. He's got more energy. I'm having a hard time keeping up with him. Some of these [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  young staffers would be out there saying and this was only a couple of weeks ago. Take [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=310.58s)]
*  a look. He's fine. All this right wing propaganda that his mental acuity is declined is wrong. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=315.74s)]
*  President Biden has a photographic memory. He is sharp, intensely probing and detail [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=322.18s)]
*  oriented and focused. I think there is so much misinformation, disinformation as we've [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=328.38s)]
*  been talking about. You talked about the video of the president wandering and it's not true. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=333.34s)]
*  President Biden is taking this debate prep incredibly seriously. You will see a very [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=339.82s)]
*  energized president Biden. I can assure you of that. Joe Biden does have any concerns [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=343.82s)]
*  about his mental fitness, nor do I. I've spent an incredible amount of time with Joe Biden. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=348.06s)]
*  That's just the fade that the other side is pushing. You all have called this the cheap [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=352.3s)]
*  fakes video and that's exactly what they are. They are cheap fakes video. Cheap fake videos. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=355.74s)]
*  All the Democrats, all the media, they've all been lying to you and to the American [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=363.54s)]
*  people for four plus long years. But after last night's debate, well, the gig is up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=369.86s)]
*  No one is fooled. Democrats are now desperately looking. Should we make a last minute change [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=377.66s)]
*  or not? Not because of the truth, which is they've known about Joe Biden's cognitive [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  and mental decline or the fact that he has been a terrible president, but because they [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=388.22s)]
*  may lose in November and the polls are showing that now they're going to get worse. They [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=393.62s)]
*  have been fully aware of Joe's decline, lying about it, hiding it all from the American [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  people. For them, political power is all that matters. They don't care about the truth [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=404.42s)]
*  or logic or doing the right thing. In 2016, they perpetrated the dirty dossier that Hillary [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=410.5s)]
*  Clinton bought and paid for, that dirty Russian disinformation dossier. Yeah, guess what? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=417.44s)]
*  That dossier and then of course, no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute Hillary for top [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=423.12s)]
*  secret classified information on her servers. What about the fact that she deleted, oh, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=428.32s)]
*  that's right, 33,000 emails, used something called bleach pit, destroyed devices with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=436.52s)]
*  SIM cards. What about the four phony FISA warrants to spy on President Trump? No consequences [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=443.44s)]
*  for anybody. Three long years, state-run media mob and Democrats lying about a Russia hoax [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  all paid for by Hillary Clinton and put together for money that she paid for. Then of course, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=459.2s)]
*  in 2020, Wink and Tony Blinken, he gets 51 Intel experts, supposedly former or though [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=466.32s)]
*  some at the time were current, to sign a bogus letter suggesting that Hunter's very real [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=473.28s)]
*  laptop was Russian disinformation. None of them ever saw the laptop. None of them knew [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  a thing about the laptop. The only thing they knew is they hated Donald Trump. They wanted [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=483.8s)]
*  Biden to win and they wanted to give Biden a talking point in that debate after the laptop [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=488.52s)]
*  story broke. So now what? In 2024, what can you expect now? What's the scheme that they're [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=494.62s)]
*  going to come up with this time? Because you need to know how deep, how profound and how [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=501.62s)]
*  dangerous Democrats, the media and the deep state have become in this country. And again, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=508.22s)]
*  nobody has ever held accountable unless of course, your last name is Trump, then they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=516.02s)]
*  make it up. And after last night, we all now know why your attorney general Merrick Garland, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  his weaponized DOJ won't release the Robert Hurd tapes and why they are using lawfare [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  against Donald Trump and protecting Joe Biden from the extremely damning information on [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=533.82s)]
*  Hunter's very real laptop where Hunter implicates his own father. Ten percent for the big guy. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=539.74s)]
*  Pops gets half my salary. Which account should we pay for Pops' home repairs? You know, remember [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=546.9s)]
*  those things? Are Democrats really now planning to topple Joe Biden? Now, of course, if they [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  want to make a change, that's not going to be easy. Joe and Joe Biden have yearned for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=558.54s)]
*  the White House for decades. You think they're just going to give up, pack it up and leave [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=563.02s)]
*  for good and the greater good? The Bidens only care about themselves. They are most [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=567.02s)]
*  certainly not weighing the impact to their party or their country. Now today, after dozens [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=572.54s)]
*  of calls to bow out from high level Democrats, well, President Biden appeared to double down [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=579.18s)]
*  on his caffeine or whatever. I don't know what it is. And they sauntered out at a campaign [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=584.38s)]
*  rally in North Carolina on a stage where he appeared, well, just as confused as normal, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  that look, that blank stare. But then today, the return of jacked up hyper caffeinated Joe [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=597.14s)]
*  and all the rage and insanity that comes with it. That's right, angry, screaming, jacked [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=606.74s)]
*  up Joe. He's back. Take a look. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  America bows to no one, no one, no one ever. Your freedom, your democracy, American self [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  is at stake. I told them how he had called a veteran and given their lives in the country [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=626.74s)]
*  in World War I and refused to go to the gravesites. He called them suckers and losers. My son [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=631.74s)]
*  was one of those people, not a war woman in the beat. Folks, Donald Trump's the first [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=636.74s)]
*  president I've heard of that's stood up there in front of the president having been one [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=641.74s)]
*  term saying, America's a failing nation. Where the hell does he think he is? America's not [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=645.74s)]
*  a losing nation. America's winning. As I stand here today, I can honestly say I've never [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=650.74s)]
*  more optimistic about America's future in my whole career. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=656.34s)]
*  It's declining because of his horrific policies and the horrific policies of radical socialists, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=660.42s)]
*  Marxists, Democrats. They're destroying the country. If Democrats want a new candidate, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=667.42s)]
*  they're going to have to force Joe off the tickets, kicking and screaming and yelling [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=672.9s)]
*  the entire way. Well, in a post on X, Barack Obama now is kind of tepidly defending Joe, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=677.5s)]
*  bad debate nights happen, but this election is still a choice between someone who has [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSIopmjVEY&t=685.02s)]
