# Joe Concha: Bad actors want to prevent Trump from being heard
**Fox News:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw)
*  And earlier tonight, former President Donald Trump returned to X, the platform formerly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=0.0s)]
*  known as Twitter, for a live conversation with its owner, Elon Musk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=5.88s)]
*  They spoke about the border, for example. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  You have millions of people coming in a month, and then she gets up and she tries to pretend [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  like she's going to do something. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  She had three and a half years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=20.92s)]
*  And by the way, they have another five months that they can do something, but they won't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=22.52s)]
*  do anything. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=26.64s)]
*  It's all talk. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=27.64s)]
*  It is essential to have a secure border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=28.8s)]
*  I mean, you're really not a country unless you have a secure border. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=32.36s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=36.08s)]
*  Trump also explained why America needs a strong and tough president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=37.08s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=41.8s)]
*  There are some real tough characters out there, and if they don't think the American president [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=42.8s)]
*  is tough, they will do what they want to do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=47.08s)]
*  I know every one of them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=49.0s)]
*  And that puts the whole world in danger. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=50.0s)]
*  Elon, I know every one of them, and I know them well. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=52.64s)]
*  I know Putin. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=55.0s)]
*  I know President Xi. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=56.0s)]
*  I know Kim Jong-un of North Korea. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=57.0s)]
*  I know every one of them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=58.44s)]
*  And let me tell you, people will say, oh, this is terrible. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=59.8s)]
*  He said, I'm not saying anything good or bad. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=62.76s)]
*  They're at the top of their game. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=65.44s)]
*  They're tough. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=67.28s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=68.12s)]
*  They're vicious. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=69.44s)]
*  And they're going to protect their country, whether they love their country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=70.72s)]
*  They probably do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=73.4s)]
*  It's just a different form of love, but they're going to protect their country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=74.28s)]
*  But these are tough people at the top of their game. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=77.4s)]
*  All right, here we're now with Reaction Project, 21 founder Horace Cooper, along with the author [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=81.8s)]
*  of the new book, Progressively Worse, Fox News contributor Joe Concha. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=86.24s)]
*  Horace, let's start with you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=90.08s)]
*  Let's get your reaction. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=92.24s)]
*  Again, I go back to what Elon Musk says is a DDoS attack, which limited the number of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=93.24s)]
*  people that could actually hear the interview, which is chilling in and of itself. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=98.96s)]
*  But that's on the heels of Donald Trump's website being attacked. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=103.8s)]
*  That's on the heels of the EU trying to silence, you know, X and Elon Musk and a platform [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  where people speak freely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Guess they don't believe in free speech or do they want to influence an American election? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=117.52s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, X is a global platform. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=123.84s)]
*  And at one point, Twitter was showing that some 51 million people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=126.16s)]
*  attempted to access. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=132.56s)]
*  Apparently about one and a half, one to one and a half million people were able to consistently [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=134.28s)]
*  listen in. I was one of those people who was able to do so. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=139.88s)]
*  It is troubling to me when the European Union suggests that a conversation that our founders [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=144.12s)]
*  intended to take place, our elected leaders are aspirants to be leaders in our country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=152.56s)]
*  We should always welcome a conversation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=161.4s)]
*  Frankly, I think rather than making jokes, it would be useful for the Biden-Harris [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=165.96s)]
*  administration to announce an open investigation to ascertain what is going on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=172.28s)]
*  By the way, if you can do this to the world's richest man, what's our electric grid like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=179.2s)]
*  if you want to shut it down? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=187.96s)]
*  Such a great point or, you know, electromagnetic pulse attack. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=190.64s)]
*  I mean, the fact that this can happen, Joe, is chilling to me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=194.88s)]
*  But Kamala Harris was laughing about it and making fun of it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=197.52s)]
*  Nothing funny about it to me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=200.72s)]
*  Not at all. And what it underscores, Sean, is that there are some bad actors who continue to want [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=203.28s)]
*  to prevent the former president from being heard on a massive platform. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=207.24s)]
*  We even had today, guys, a Washington Post journalist ask the White House during the press [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=210.84s)]
*  briefing if they could step in and intervene and stop Trump's interview with Elon on X, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=216.88s)]
*  because, well, you look at the numbers now, Elon Musk, Donald Trump's space is not a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=224.56s)]
*  largest in X history with more than 1.3 million listeners. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=229.0s)]
*  And here you have a Washington Post reporter saying the government should get involved and squash [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=233.08s)]
*  free speech, a conversation between two men. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=236.56s)]
*  But wait a minute. But then Harris said 51 million tried to log in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=238.8s)]
*  I didn't see that number. Harris, is that correct? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=243.56s)]
*  It's sitting right there on Twitter. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=246.96s)]
*  And I was able to see it while I was logged on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=248.6s)]
*  The point here is that we should be encouraging participation, not discouraging. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=252.04s)]
*  Sure. You're exactly right about this, Mr. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=257.76000000000005s)]
*  Kaja. Joe, back to you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I think they had to limit the amount of people, yeah, that were were in in listening [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  because of the attack. They couldn't quite get everything back online. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=267.36s)]
*  So they had to limit the number of people that are in there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=270.8s)]
*  That's what I understand. But it was an interesting conversation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  They talked about the assassination attempt at length. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  They talked about illegal immigration even more at length. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=277.16s)]
*  Trump hit Kamala Harris hard for claiming she'll be tougher on the border if elected. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=279.36s)]
*  Yep. She actually said that with Trump saying, where have you been the past three and a half [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  years? And they're still going now as we speak. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=287.24s)]
*  This thing could go to midnight. This conversation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=289.24s)]
*  Trump seemed very relaxed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=291.36s)]
*  All while Kamala Harris has now got 23 days since essentially becoming the domineer without [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=293.0s)]
*  taking one question of substance. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=297.2s)]
*  I mean, you'll find Jimmy Hoppa before you find Kamala Harris in front of a press [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=299.16s)]
*  conference or doing anything remotely resembling a tough interview. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump should continue to post on X even after today, because boy, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=308.08s)]
*  he's getting a lot of views, a lot of attention. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=311.88s)]
*  Well said. I know that X will post this afterwards so people can hear in, you know, this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=313.4s)]
*  spare time like a podcast. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=320.08s)]
*  More Hannity. Straight ahead. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4AsBv0duiw&t=321.76s)]
