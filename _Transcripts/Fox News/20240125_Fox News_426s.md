# Hannity: A major showdown is now underway
**Fox News:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw)
*  Now, to more major news from that southern border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, in recent weeks, the state of Texas, they finally, at a mere necessity, had to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=2.92s)]
*  take total control of a public park. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  This is one an eagle pass that served as a very key entry point for waves of illegal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=10.64s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=16.2s)]
*  Joe Biden unvetted illegal immigrants, now around the 10 million mark. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=17.2s)]
*  For three long years, Joe Biden has refused to secure this location or almost any other [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=21.46s)]
*  location along our southern border. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=26.68s)]
*  We're now, as I said, approaching 10 million illegal, unvetted Biden immigrants pouring [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=29.8s)]
*  into Texas, and then, of course, being distributed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Free transportation by Joe Biden, more than the entire population of Dallas now going [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  to city and states that, frankly, have no idea what to do with these people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=43.2s)]
*  And few, by the way, have undergone any, certainly not proper, security vetting, no health screening, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=47.96s)]
*  all requiring your public assistance dollars. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=54.84s)]
*  This is a crisis that impacts and affects every single corner of the country, but it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=59.02s)]
*  the most severe in border states. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=63.82s)]
*  So Governor Greg Abbott, well, they're not going to enforce the law. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=66.22s)]
*  He had to take matters into his own hands, as he should, and he declared a disaster, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=69.8s)]
*  which it is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=74.38s)]
*  He deployed state police, the National Guard, to secure the Texas border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=75.48s)]
*  He booted the feds out of Shelby Park in Eagle's Pass. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=79.94s)]
*  They weren't doing their job. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=83.66s)]
*  He ordered the installation of new barriers and razor wire to deter illegal crossings. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=85.3s)]
*  So how did the Biden administration thank Texas for their effort to do their job for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=90.46s)]
*  them and secure the border? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=95.2s)]
*  They sued Texas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=96.82s)]
*  Now, this is the same Joe Biden. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=98.06s)]
*  You know, Vladimir Putin can shoot down our drones, no consequences. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=100.14s)]
*  Invade Ukraine? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=105.34s)]
*  Eh, not a lot of consequences. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=106.34s)]
*  President Xi, spy balloons, unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft confronting our [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=108.82s)]
*  Air Force in international airways, our Navy in international waterways. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  The mullahs in Iran walk all over Joe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=120.62s)]
*  What does he do? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=122.78s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=123.78s)]
*  All of a sudden now, your president wants to act tough because he's dealing with the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=124.78s)]
*  state of Texas, because the governor is doing Joe's job, that the governor is upholding [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=128.26s)]
*  the law, that Governor Abbott is trying to secure the border in his state and enforce [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=133.86s)]
*  the laws of our country to keep not only his citizens safe, but all of us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=139.66s)]
*  And Biden's suing the state over a new law enabling local law enforcement to arrest [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=145.04s)]
*  illegal immigrants in this country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And he even sued Texas over the installation of razor wire at the border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=152.9s)]
*  And what was that insane 5-4 decision? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=157.6s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can take down the wire. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=160.5s)]
*  However, if you look at that ruling, they didn't prohibit Texas from putting it up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=165.72s)]
*  So now Abbott has ordered the installation of even more razor wire. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=170.7s)]
*  And the court, by the way, did not give an opinion on Abbott's decision to boot the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=175.1s)]
*  federal government out of Shelby Park. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  So now we're going to have a law enforcement bizarre showdown, which is now underway, between [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=181.26s)]
*  Abbott and Texas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  They want to enforce the law, secure the border, versus Biden and the federal government, the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=188.88s)]
*  ones that have encouraged lawlessness and asylum abuse, the very people that have been [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=193.7s)]
*  abetting those people, breaking the law, allowing unvetted people from all over the world into [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=199.82s)]
*  our country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=205.26s)]
*  And Abbott, by the way, is not standing alone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=206.82s)]
*  We got to give a big shout out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=208.98s)]
*  A lot of Republican governors now from 25 states have signed a resolution supporting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=210.22s)]
*  Texas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=215.9s)]
*  Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin tweeting, quote, Virginia stands with Texas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=216.9s)]
*  Governor Abbott is doing the job Joe Biden and his border czar. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=221.74s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=225.54s)]
*  Refused to do. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=226.54s)]
*  President Biden won't defend us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=228.7s)]
*  States will have to defend themselves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=232.22s)]
*  Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, quote, the Biden administration's policy has been a total [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=234.26s)]
*  failure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  We need change now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  I support Texas and I support Governor Abbott. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also standing firmly behind Texas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=249.82s)]
*  Biden is going after Texas, saying that they must remove fortifications from their border. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=250.82s)]
*  They've put wire. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=256.66s)]
*  They put things to keep people out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=257.66s)]
*  Biden saying you got to take that down to let people come in illegally, which is just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  crazy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=265.26s)]
*  And I remark that if the Constitution was originally understood to mean that a state [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  could not protect itself against an invasion, that the federal government could force a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=272.06s)]
*  state to allow an invasion, the Constitution would have never been ratified in the first [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=276.82s)]
*  place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=281.26s)]
*  So you have Texas here that's holding its ground. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=282.26s)]
*  They have every right to fortify the border vis-a-vis an invasion. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=285.02s)]
*  And that's Article One, Section 10 of the Constitution. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=289.41999999999996s)]
*  So they're in the right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's be clear here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  These aren't just kind words for a fellow governor. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=297.02s)]
*  These 25 states, they're offering manpower. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=300.9s)]
*  They're offering security. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=303.74s)]
*  They're offering real support. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=304.94s)]
*  Blue state governors whine and complain, beg for more federal money. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=306.78s)]
*  You know, Republican governors, they want to take action and enforce the law. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=310.78s)]
*  So is Republican Congressman, by the way, Mike Collins, this week, announcing legislation [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=314.3s)]
*  that would prohibit federal officials from removing barriers at the border. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=318.98s)]
*  But according to MSDNC host Joy Reid, protecting the border is racist, even comparing support [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=323.26s)]
*  for border security to Jim Crow-era segregation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=330.14s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=333.62s)]
*  This is NBC News. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=335.26s)]
*  This massive resistance, it sounds like the old Southerners who said that we will resist [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=338.3s)]
*  by any means necessary, that Chip Roy language. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=342.82s)]
*  How does that read inside of the Latino community? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=345.26s)]
*  Will somebody tell Joy that her favorite president, Joe Biden, once worked with the former Klansman [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=349.3s)]
*  to stop the integration of public schools. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=355.1s)]
*  He didn't want them to be racial jungles. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=357.02s)]
*  She may want to know that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=359.3s)]
*  Pretty delusional otherwise. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=361.1s)]
*  Now, of course, all of the far-left vitriol, next year we could have a commander-in-chief [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=362.1s)]
*  that would actually restore security on our southern border. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=366.78s)]
*  On Truth Social, former President Trump writing, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=370.61999999999995s)]
*  We encourage all willing states to deploy their guards to Texas to prevent the entry [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=373.05999999999995s)]
*  of illegals and to remove them back across the border. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Those that Biden has let in should not get comfortable because they will not, they will [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  be going home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=387.46s)]
*  Now, in the meantime, Governor Abbott, he's not backing down. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=388.46s)]
*  Every day, more law enforcement, more barriers, more razor wire. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=392.02s)]
*  According to Abbott, the showdown will not end until our border is secure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=396.1s)]
*  All right, here's the big question of the night. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=400.34s)]
*  What's Joey going to do? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  Is he going to precipitate a fight between federal law enforcement and Texas Guard? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=404.74s)]
*  Is he going to send troops to confront the Texas Guard? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRjQdUlMCw&t=411.34000000000003s)]
