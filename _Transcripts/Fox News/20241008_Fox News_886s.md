# Sean Hannity: A political storm is brewing
**Fox News:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A)
*  But first, we are just 28 days until an inflection point for our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=0.0s)]
*  That is called Election Day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=3.84s)]
*  A political storm is brewing across the country as the hurricane is now bearing down on Florida. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=5.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris, she decided to pick a fight with Governor Ron DeSantis, who's busy trying [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=11.6s)]
*  to save the lives of Floridians and also prestaging 30,000 utility trucks and trucks with water [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=16.88s)]
*  and food and medicine and supplies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=23.96s)]
*  And she's trashing him in public for not taking the time to speak with her on the phone, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=26.64s)]
*  a call that he never received. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=32.2s)]
*  Last night on this program, Governor Ron DeSantis responded. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=34.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=37.64s)]
*  For Kamala Harris to try to say that my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=38.8s)]
*  selfish is delusional. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  She has no role in this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=50.44s)]
*  I've dealt with a number of storms under this administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=53.24s)]
*  She has never contributed anything to any of these efforts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=56.44s)]
*  And so what I think is selfish is her trying to blunder into this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=60.72s)]
*  No. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  I've had storms under both President Trump and President Biden, and I've worked well [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  with both of them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=70.64s)]
*  She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=71.64s)]
*  of her campaign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=78.36s)]
*  She never one time, never before, ever called Governor DeSantis before, during or after [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=81.76s)]
*  any other hurricane. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=86.64s)]
*  And Kamala's trying to pretend that she cares about hurricanes for the very first time [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  ever. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  And DeSantis, as per usual, is working around the clock trying to save lives and property. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=94.12s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala's boss, Joe Biden, he doesn't seem interested in his vice president's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=100.28s)]
*  dishonest brand of politics. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  And for the second time this week, Joe Biden has overshadowed Kamala's public appearances [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=108.02s)]
*  with his own counterprogramming. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  And today, at the very moment that Kamala was meeting with that hard-hitting news show, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=115.78s)]
*  The Ladies of the View, while smearing DeSantis again, Biden talked to reporters at the White [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=121.16s)]
*  House, and he preys on the Florida governor, my governor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=130.66s)]
*  The governor of Florida has been cooperative. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=131.66s)]
*  He said he's gotten all that he needs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  I talked to him again yesterday, and I said, whatever. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=136.58s)]
*  I said, no, you're doing a great job. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=140.22s)]
*  It's all being done well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=142.5s)]
*  We thank you for it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=145.78s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala Harris has literally offered no help to North Carolina, no help [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  to Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, none. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=153.86s)]
*  She's been out on the campaign trail, out in Hollywood raising money. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=157.58s)]
*  And you may have noticed that both Joe and Jill Biden have been largely absent from the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  campaign trail. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=164.52s)]
*  Many now speculating that the Harris campaign was trying to put distance between the failed [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=166.1s)]
*  policies of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=170.5s)]
*  But today, that hard-hitting interview that she had on The View, if, you know, asked if [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=173.78s)]
*  she would do anything differently over the past four years, Kamala said, not a thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=178.74s)]
*  She wouldn't change a thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=185.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  The influence of a personal experience will have its impact on the presidency? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  past four years? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms ofâ€”and I've been a part of most of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=202.26s)]
*  the decisions that have had impact. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  But on day one, she's going to change inflation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=211.94s)]
*  On day one, she's going to fix the border. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=214.1s)]
*  Day one was January 20, 2021. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=216.22s)]
*  Not a thing? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=221.12s)]
*  Not the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  She was the last person in the room. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=226.36s)]
*  Thirteen American troops dead. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=228.28s)]
*  Let's see, hundreds of Americans left behind enemy lines. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Not the carnage overseas funded by Iranian mullahs with the billions that she and Joe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=234.26s)]
*  made available to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=239.88s)]
*  They helped make Iran rich again. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=241.84s)]
*  What about the record-setting inflation caused by a historic level of new spending from Biden [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=243.72s)]
*  and Harris? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=249.16s)]
*  What about the border crisis? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=250.16s)]
*  A record 12-plus unvetted illegals from over 180 countries, many with terror ties, many [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=251.92s)]
*  from countries that are top geopolitical foes, pouring into the country as her time as border [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=259.24s)]
*  czar. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=265.04s)]
*  And tonight, our very own Bill Mollusian is reporting that the FBI just arrested an Afghan [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=266.04s)]
*  national allowed in under Harris and Biden, who is plotting an ISIS-inspired terror attack [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=271.02s)]
*  on Election Day. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=277.2s)]
*  Oh, and we do have Iranian assassination squads in our country trying to kill Donald Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=278.32s)]
*  On 60 Minutes of what became a train wreck interview, it was supposed to be a layup [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=284.68s)]
*  interview, Kamala Harris was asked not once, not twice, but three times if it was a mistake [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  to allow millions of unvetted illegal immigrants into the country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=295.12s)]
*  She refuses to answer the question. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=299.52s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=301.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=302.32s)]
*  Our rivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=303.32s)]
*  Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=309.44s)]
*  It's a long-standing problem. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=316.04s)]
*  And solutions are at hand. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  first place? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=332.84s)]
*  I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=333.84s)]
*  a problem. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=339.96s)]
*  OK? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=340.96s)]
*  But the numbers did quadruple under your watch. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=341.96s)]
*  And the numbers today, because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  immigration by half. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=350.08s)]
*  But should you have done that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  But we need Congress to be able to act. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=355.76s)]
*  Was it a mistake? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=362.04s)]
*  The numbers quadrupled. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=363.04s)]
*  Your borders are no answer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=364.04s)]
*  Now, coming up tonight, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he'll join us. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=367.04s)]
*  He will respond to Kamala's lies and deflections. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=370.16s)]
*  Now, of course, that 60-minute interview, that should have been a walk in the park for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=372.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  It was designed for her to have a walk in the park. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  Many of the vice president's worst word salads were actually edited from the interview, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=383.12s)]
*  shocking from, abusively biased, CBS. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=388.24s)]
*  But it was still a disaster for Kamala, and that's only the beginning. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=391.44s)]
*  As panic over poll numbers start to set in, the Harris campaign, that's the only reason [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  they're sending Kamala on this media blitz with friendly outlets, you know, CBS, Colbert, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=399.88s)]
*  The View, Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=407.48s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=410.64s)]
*  Oh, Howard Stern. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=412.24s)]
*  We can't forget about Howard Stern's interview, because she sat down earlier with the former [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=413.88s)]

*  What the hell happened to Howard? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=422.32000000000005s)]

*  You know, sadly, now himself is an erotic, you know, woke, polo-loving, cat-loving shadow [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=426.52000000000004s)]

*  He doesn't want them, I guess, to listen to his program anymore, paralyzed by the fear [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  of COVID-19, asking nothing but pathetic, meaningless questions and discussing Kamala's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=443.64s)]
*  favorite brand of cereal? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=449.52s)]
*  Gee, Howard. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=451.76s)]
*  Will the real Howard, you know, Howard come back to life? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=453.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=457.56s)]
*  Why are you eating for breakfast? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=458.56s)]
*  Raisin Bran, I read. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  I feel that's notâ€”for someone who's healthy and you have a good figure, why raisin bran? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of sugar. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=467.32s)]
*  Well, no, so I don't eat raisin bran every morning. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=468.64s)]
*  If you asked me what was my favorite cereal, I would put it right up there with, okay, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=471.6s)]
*  now this is going to be obnoxious, and special K. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=476.16s)]
*  Special K isâ€” [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=479.24s)]
*  Well, it's really great. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=480.8s)]
*  Plus, my mother used to make these special K cookies in honor of me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=481.8s)]
*  Will the real Howard Stern please return to life? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=488.04s)]
*  And who cares what cereal that Kamala Harris likes? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=490.6s)]
*  Is this going to move the political needle? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  Any of these interviews? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=495.82000000000005s)]
*  Not a chance. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=497.24s)]
*  And by the way, what cereal that Kamala loves costs about 28 percent more since she became [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=498.4s)]
*  vice president? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=505.12s)]
*  In fact, most things in America are up over 20 percent. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=506.12s)]
*  And while it doesn't seem to matter to the multimillionaires giving softball interviews [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=509.92s)]
*  to Kamala Harris, these price hikes are like a massive hidden tax for most American families, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=513.76s)]
*  many of which are putting bare necessities on credit cards. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=520.16s)]
*  But again, as she said on The View, there's not a thing she would have done differently, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=523.34s)]
*  which brings us back to her administration's terrible hurricane response, the worst in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=528.12s)]
*  American history. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=532.84s)]
*  Did you know that Kamala Harris regularly skipped the hurricane preparedness briefings? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=533.84s)]
*  Too busy hanging out with her Hollywood friends. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  And it kind of seems pretty important now, doesn't it? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=542.96s)]
*  Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=545.84s)]
*  Pay attention closely. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=548.12s)]
*  Under Biden and Harris, FEMA, they had a preoccupation. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=549.84s)]
*  That preoccupation was with woke politics. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=554.0s)]
*  The information is right there on FEMA.com. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=557.86s)]
*  They're calling it fake news, but it's in their own words. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=561.38s)]
*  There are three stated goals on FEMA's website. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=565.0200000000001s)]
*  Quote, instill equity as a foundation of emergency management. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=568.86s)]
*  According to the wordy description, this goal was about prioritizing and tailoring emergency [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=574.58s)]
*  management for certain races and gender identities. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=580.1s)]
*  The second goal, quote, lead whole of community and climate resilience. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=584.42s)]
*  Now, of course, this was all about the left and their religious obsession about global [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=589.62s)]
*  warming and climate change. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  The very last goal is about emergency preparedness. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=597.86s)]
*  So you can see what the administration is prioritizing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=601.4s)]
*  How about this? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  How about if there's a natural disaster, like there's been in North Carolina, South [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=607.18s)]
*  Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, how about you help out every American in need? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=612.86s)]
*  And how about you not steal the money from FEMA and give it to your unvetted illegal [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=618.94s)]
*  immigrants from 180 countries? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=623.48s)]
*  Because their illegal immigrants seem to be prioritized and are way more important than [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=626.26s)]
*  the American people, the people that are now currently suffering and not getting the help [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=631.9s)]
*  they need in spite of proclamations to the contrary. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=637.02s)]
*  We have DHS Secretary Alejandro Muircas saying FEMA is running out of money and going bankrupt. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=640.9s)]
*  Bankrupt? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=647.3s)]
*  This has not been a busy hurricane season. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=648.34s)]
*  This after the FEMA directed more than $1 billion to pay for housing and food for Harris [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=651.16s)]
*  Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=658.02s)]
*  Because this story looks really bad for Democrats in charge, they are trying to just outright [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=660.54s)]
*  lie to you and pretend this is misinformation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=667.06s)]
*  This is a deep fake statement by conservatives. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=670.84s)]
*  Well, it's also on the FEMA website. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=673.6s)]
*  It's completely truthful. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=676.72s)]
*  It's completely real, just like Hunter Biden laptop was not misinformation, but very real. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=678.0400000000001s)]
*  Democrats, the state run media mob, they simply lie. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=684.48s)]
*  They push propaganda before elections. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=687.9s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=690.4s)]
*  But in April press release from FEMA's own website, let me read it to you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  It states the following. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=696.2800000000001s)]
*  Today, the Department of Homeland Security through FEMA and the U.S. Customs and Border [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=697.6s)]
*  Protection announced $300 million in grants through the Shelter and Services Program, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=702.12s)]
*  which was authorized by Congress to support communities that are providing services to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  migrants. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=712.76s)]
*  Let me interpret. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=714.08s)]
*  That means illegal alien, a word that Kamala wants you to be courageous enough to never [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=715.2s)]
*  use, like radical Islamic terrorists. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=720.0s)]
*  She wants you to be courageous and never use that word either. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  It goes on. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=726.1s)]
*  Additionally, DHS is announcing $340.9 million through the Shelter and Services Program and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=727.6s)]
*  their competitive grant program to be allocated before the end of the fiscal year, the last [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=734.82s)]
*  two years, over a billion dollars from FEMA to help Harris and Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=740.38s)]
*  It is not a deep fake. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=748.14s)]
*  It's not misinformation. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=749.34s)]
*  It is the truth. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=751.08s)]
*  This is the Biden-Harris administration caught red-handed dedicating a massive amount of [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=752.4s)]
*  money that was supposed to be there for emergency relief for Americans in North Carolina, Georgia [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=758.04s)]
*  and elsewhere to dispense to illegal immigrants, while hurricane-ravaged victims all over the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  country are left out to dry. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=771.4599999999999s)]
*  Again, it's about their priorities. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=773.52s)]
*  And under Biden and Harris, the American people also seem to come last. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, earlier today, Sarah Carter, she was asking North Carolinians about FEMA's lackluster [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=780.34s)]
*  response. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=786.54s)]
*  Here is what they had to say. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=787.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=788.98s)]
*  A lot of residents have felt, when I speak to them, they say, you know what, it's been [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=789.98s)]
*  12 days, I feel abandoned, I haven't seen any response. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=794.48s)]
*  Now some response is coming through. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=797.76s)]
*  Some FEMA representatives are down on the ground. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=800.5s)]
*  It's been 12 days later. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=803.46s)]
*  Should have been sooner. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=806.78s)]
*  It should have been immediate. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  It should have been immediate. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=810.52s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, thank God for the people of North Carolina, the residents, the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=811.52s)]
*  fire chiefs. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  We have the two best fire chiefs in this area in the world. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  The response time from our citizens, our residents, they're supporting us. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=821.0s)]
*  That's who's going to rebuild this community. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=826.48s)]
*  President Biden basically made a statement saying that people are getting what they need, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=828.68s)]
*  that they're happy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=834.0s)]
*  Are you getting what you need? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=835.0s)]
*  Are you happy? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=836.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=837.22s)]
*  We're getting what we need, but it's from people in Jimmy Rock. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=838.22s)]
*  Not from the government. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=843.34s)]
*  Oh, like the basic necessities from your friends. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=844.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=847.42s)]
*  But the bigger picture, no. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=848.42s)]
*  We're not happy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=850.42s)]
*  The message right now is just help. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=852.7s)]
*  There's really not much more I can say. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=855.46s)]
*  We need help. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=857.34s)]
*  We're American citizens. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=859.14s)]
*  We're hardworking. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=860.74s)]
*  We do our jobs. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=861.74s)]
*  We volunteer. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aok_pE6q76A&t=862.74s)]
