# Hannity: Illegal immigration is the 'worst,' 'self-induced' crisis in US history
**Fox News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight buckle up for another big interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=0.0s)]
*  Only hours ago, I traveled back to the D.C. Swamp. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=9.92s)]
*  I sat down with the vice president, J.D. Vance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=12.56s)]
*  We're going to bring you that exclusive interview in just a moment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=15.08s)]
*  Also tonight, after Caroline Levitt's shock and awe debut, a star was born in the White [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=18.56s)]
*  House briefing room. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=24.72s)]
*  Well, members of the state-run legacy media mob, they wasted no time launching their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=26.0s)]
*  predictable vile attacks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=31.28s)]
*  Wait until you see what Joyless Behar, Whoopi Goldberg all had to say, and Caroline, she [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=33.24s)]
*  will join us with her response. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=38.68s)]
*  That's straight ahead. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=40.52s)]
*  But first, President Trump, he just is just nonstop continuing to deliver on promise after [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=41.52s)]
*  promise after promise, in this case, to secure our borders. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=48.64s)]
*  Earlier today, he signed the Lakin Riley Act, surrounded by members of her loving [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=51.92s)]
*  family, including her mother, who made a heart-wrenching statement. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=56.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=60.88s)]
*  Our family will forever be grateful for the prayers of the people across our nation and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  for helping to get this legislation into law. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=67.56s)]
*  We also want to thank President Trump for the promises he made to us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=71.08s)]
*  He said he would secure our borders and that he would never forget about Lakin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=75.72s)]
*  And he hasn't. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=82.0s)]
*  He's a man of his word. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=83.0s)]
*  I trust that he will fight for the American people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=84.76s)]
*  Most importantly, I want to thank our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, because without [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=91.08s)]
*  his sacrifices, Lakin's story would have ended on that horrific day that she was taken from us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=95.76s)]
*  Where's Selena Gomez? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=103.2s)]
*  Where's that post? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=104.84s)]
*  A beautiful tribute, a sad loss to a young woman's life, not only to an amazing young [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=106.12s)]
*  woman whose life was cut short by a Harris-Biden-Mayorkas, unvetted illegal immigrant, but also to all [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  of the innocent Americans, all the Lakin Riley's, all of the people that have been murdered, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  all the Americans that have been raped, all the Americans that have been victims of violent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  crimes at the hands of these unvetted illegals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=129.04s)]
*  You might not forget about 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary, or that 13-year-old girl raped in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=132.68s)]
*  broad daylight in a park in Queens, New York that was videotaped, or that 37-year-old mother [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=137.64s)]
*  of five, Rachel Morin, whose young children, they will never, ever see their mother again. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=143.32s)]
*  Remember, these names, we scrolled these names all throughout the election. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=149.32s)]
*  Nobody else in the media talked about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=154.27999999999997s)]
*  We did almost every night. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=156.04s)]
*  And these are people, the names of people that were murdered and raped and victims of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  violent crime. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  If you add up all the victims of these crimes at the hands of Harris-Biden-unvetted illegals, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  the number is in the thousands. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=171.0s)]
*  And the blame for that is directly on Biden, Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=173.4s)]
*  They all have, and I've said it before and I'll say it again, they have blood on their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=179.88s)]
*  hands and they lie to all of you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=184.84s)]
*  They lie to the entire country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  And sadly, there will likely be more blood and even an attack on our homeland as a result [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=190.48s)]
*  of their failure by allowing known terrorists into the country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=196.44s)]
*  But we don't know where they are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=200.28s)]
*  For years, by the way, four years, they sat in their air-conditioned offices, didn't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=202.04s)]
*  bother to go down to the border, did nothing but lie to all of us while allowing a full-scale [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=206.48s)]
*  invasion at our southern border, the worst self-induced national security crisis by far [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=213.0s)]
*  in our country's history. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=219.84s)]
*  Thankfully, President Trump is following through on his promises to clean up this mess that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  the Biden White House left behind. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=228.28s)]
*  And during the signing of the Lake and Riley Act, he also announced an executive order [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=230.52s)]
*  allowing up to 30,000 of the most violent, criminal, illegal aliens to be sent to Gitmo. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  But Trump didn't stop there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=242.8s)]
*  He also signed an executive order pledging to cancel student visas for the pro-Hamas [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=244.2s)]
*  protesters who disrupted college campuses all across our country, the virulent anti-Semitism [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=249.56s)]
*  we witnessed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=255.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, the effects of the president's crackdown on illegal immigration are being [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=256.84s)]
*  felt all across the country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=261.12s)]
*  In an early morning raid today, DEA agents arrested four suspects in Colorado with purported [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=263.24s)]
*  to one of these violent cartel gangs and the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=270.56s)]
*  The arrest came just one day after federal law enforcement officials conducted immigration [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=276.52s)]
*  raids in New York City. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=280.64s)]
*  DEA agents said this critical operation would not have been possible without President Donald [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=282.44s)]
*  Trump's leadership. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=288.44s)]
*  Now an alleged ringleader of that violent Tren de Aragua gang is off the streets, and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=290.2s)]
*  DHS Secretary Kristianou was there when it happened and has now revealed he was trying [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  to buy grenades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  And thanks to Biden and Harris and Mayorkas, this is likely the tip of the iceberg. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  This will be their long-term legacy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=308.46s)]
*  But in the meantime, thankfully, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, he is launching [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  an investigation asking sanctuary city mayors to come and testify before Congress. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=315.84s)]
*  How many times on this show have we said they're aiding, they're abetting the law [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=322.36s)]
*  breaking, they're helping in human trafficking? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=325.92s)]
*  And as borders are, Tom Homan said, local politicians who obstruct the mass deportations, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  they themselves could face charges. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=336.0s)]
*  But predictably many on the left wing and the left wing state-run media mob and Democrats, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=338.44s)]
*  once again, they go back to their tried and true nine-year-old mantra. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, fascist, racist, Nazi. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=348.6s)]
*  This is what the Democrats and the state-run legacy media mob have become. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=354.44s)]
*  This is who they have been now for 10 years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  Just take a look at how they conducted themselves during RFK's confirmation hearing from earlier [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  today. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no issue that's united us more than this chronic health epidemic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=374.16s)]
*  These are our kids. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=378.36s)]
*  66% of them are damaged. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=379.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody is going to be able to do this like I have because of my peculiar [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=382.56s)]
*  experience, because I've litigated against these agencies. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=389.4s)]
*  When you litigate against them, you get a PhD in corporate capture and how to unravel [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=393.84s)]
*  it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=398.32s)]
*  I've written six books about these agencies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=399.32s)]
*  I know a lot about them and I know how to fix it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=402.76s)]
*  And there's nobody who will fix it the way that I do because I'm not scared of vested [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=405.68s)]
*  interest. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=411.32s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=412.32s)]
*  He did an amazing job on Capitol Hill, just like all the other cabinet officials that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=413.32s)]
*  went before the U.S. Senate. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=419.48s)]
*  They didn't really lay a glove on him. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=420.8s)]
*  They're just angry. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=422.4s)]
*  Despite spending more money on health care than any other country in the world, the overall [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=423.56s)]
*  health and well-being of the American people is not in a good place. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  And Trump, RFK, no, we can't be strong if our people are all sick. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=432.44s)]
*  But the Democrats at today's hearing must have missed the memo because they acted like [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=436.8s)]
*  a group of overgrown, petulant children throwing a temper tantrum. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  And at one point, Bernie Sanders screaming about baby onesies. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  Can't make this up. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=449.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=451.56s)]
*  Will you commit not to fire anyone in the health arena who currently works on protecting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=452.56s)]
*  Americans from cyber attacks in their health care files? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=459.9s)]
*  I will. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEuT4d-x94&t=462.78s)]
