# Sean Hannity: This is a problem
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and we are broadcasting from the great state of South Carolina, home [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Gamecocks, by the way. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=5.96s)]
*  Anyway, tonight, I told you this would happen, that your president, Joe Biden, would get [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  desperate and then go back to the Democratic playbook. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=12.52s)]
*  And at 38 percent approval rating from Gallup and 86 percent of the people thinking he's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=16.12s)]
*  too old to be president, well, he's that desperate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=21.98s)]
*  So what does he do? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=25.16s)]
*  He resorts to using the worn-out race card tactics to attack Republicans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=26.8s)]
*  You're not going to believe the lies that he's spewing this time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=31.76s)]
*  Now, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, he will join us in a few minutes, as well as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=36.04s)]
*  Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=39.92s)]
*  But first, tomorrow, former President Trump and former Governor Nikki Haley, they will [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=40.92s)]
*  square off in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Now, after coming in third in the Iowa caucuses, losing by double digits in New Hampshire, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  losing to the option of none of these candidates in Nevada by more than 30 points, I would [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=55.32s)]
*  argue that everything is pretty much on the line for Nikki Haley in her home state. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  Across the board, pundits are wondering, is this the last chance for former Governor Nikki [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=67.0s)]
*  Haley in the presidential primary? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  She has promised to stay in the race regardless of the results, but here's a problem, and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=74.16s)]
*  it's very real. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=78.68s)]
*  According to the RealClear Politics polling average, she trails former President Donald [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=79.68s)]
*  Trump by more than 25 points. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=84.84s)]
*  That's a big margin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, I would argue, as we get closer to Election Day, things always tighten up in the final [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  days of a primary. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=93.72000000000001s)]
*  But where will she win? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  What state will she win if she doesn't win her home state? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=97.92000000000002s)]
*  And how would, you know, any double-digit loss be in her home state? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=101.2s)]
*  And while she spent the last week desperately making the case to voters in what is a last-ditch [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=105.9s)]
*  effort, well, there's a lot of ground to make up in one single day. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=111.86s)]
*  And meanwhile, Nikki Haley's bus tour continues. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=115.9s)]
*  Donald Trump, he held the huge primary eve rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina tonight. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look at some of these highlights. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  — Tomorrow, you will cast one of the most important votes of your entire life. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  And honestly, we're not very worried about tomorrow. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=132.66s)]
*  We want to aim toward a time called November 5th. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=134.96s)]
*  That's what we need. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  November 5th. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Got to beat crooked Joe Biden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  If it's going to be him, I don't know if he's going to make it to the starting gate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=145.08s)]
*  We're going to do great tomorrow, but it's really important you get out and vote because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=148.36s)]
*  we want to send a signal to the real, the real hardline people, the people that are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  destroying our country, Joe Biden. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  We got to send them a signal that we're coming. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=159.96s)]
*  We're going to send them a big, so get out tomorrow. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=162.36s)]
*  We're going to win this state, and then we're going to tell crooked Joe Biden, you're [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=164.6s)]
*  fired. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=170.16s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=171.16s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=172.16s)]
*  Now, earlier today, Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhart, well, she spoke with voters [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=173.16s)]
*  in Columbia, South Carolina, by the way, her hometown, ahead of Election Day tomorrow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=181.32s)]
*  And here's what they had to say. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=186.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=187.76s)]
*  Tomorrow's the election. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=188.76s)]
*  Are you going to go to the polls? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=189.76s)]
*  We are, yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=191.16s)]
*  Who are you all voting for? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=192.16s)]
*  We're going to vote for Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=193.16s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=194.72s)]
*  We have a very large family, and, you know, we just need things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=195.72s)]
*  They were not like this a few years ago when he was in office. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=200.56s)]
*  So we just want to see if we can get lower gas prices and lower groceries and things [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=202.92s)]
*  like that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=207.22s)]
*  Voting tomorrow, who are you voting for? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=208.22s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=210.22s)]
*  OK, why is that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=211.22s)]
*  Because I like where we were four years ago. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=212.22s)]
*  Who are you voting for? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=215.04s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=217.8s)]
*  But I'm going to support whoever the Republican is that gets nominated at the convention. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=218.8s)]
*  And so if President Trump gets the nomination, that's who I'm—I will definitely support [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=227.52s)]
*  him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=233.44s)]
*  You've already voted. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=234.44s)]
*  Do you mind if I ask who you voted for? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=235.44s)]
*  We voted for Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=237.36s)]
*  OK, why? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=238.68s)]
*  I think we need some strength in this country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=240.24s)]
*  And having served in the military for over 26 years, I think we need to have that sort [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  of mentality to be strong again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=249.88s)]
*  I am going to the polls tomorrow, and I am on the fence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=253.4s)]
*  You know, I really am. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=256.04s)]
*  I mean, I know Donald Trump did a fabulous job when he was president, and that just keeps [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=258.08s)]
*  hounding me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=264.52s)]
*  But sometimes I'd like a change, too. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=265.52s)]
*  And Nikki Haley did so much for our state, and I'm just so proud of how well she has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=268.76s)]
*  become as a woman. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=274.64s)]
*  So I think I'll know when I walk in there tomorrow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=276.72s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm voting for Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  OK, what do you like about Trump? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  He seems to get things done. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  He's concerned with the same things I'm concerned with, primarily the border. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=284.8s)]
*  I feel like we've already lost our country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=290.0s)]
*  I don't know that we'll ever get it back. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=291.6s)]
*  To catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=298.68s)]
*  else. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k7xf5dwyo4&t=303.52s)]
