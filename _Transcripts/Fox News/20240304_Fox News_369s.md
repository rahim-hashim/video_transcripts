*  Dakota where the polls are now officially all closed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=10.4s)]
*  We'll continue to monitor and update you throughout the evening and of course [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=13.86s)]
*  Super Tuesday is tomorrow and these are the states that will be voting tomorrow [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=18.3s)]
*  Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=23.28s)]
*  Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  There'll be a test after the show but first former president Donald Trump scored a major victory today when the US Supreme Court [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=33.0s)]
*  Unanimously reversed that ruling that barred him from appearing on the Colorado ballot ahead of tomorrow's primary [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Now saying in the majority opinion quote states have no power under the Constitution [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=47.32s)]
*  to enforce section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=52.72s)]
*  presidency [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=57.64s)]
*  President Trump reacted to this decision on truth social calling it a big win for America and he's right based on the oral [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=58.56s)]
*  Arguments the decision is not a surprise [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=66.56s)]
*  This should have been and was a slam-dunk case and while they issued a concurring opinion [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=69.28s)]
*  Even the three liberal justices they sided with Trump now today's decision has ramifications well beyond just Colorado [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=74.84s)]
*  Remember a judge in Cook County in Illinois ruled that Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=82.32s)]
*  It was ineligible for the state's primary ballot just last week and of course in the state of Maine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  They have a leftist secretary of state [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  Unilaterally decided to remove him from the ballot in that state without any legal proceedings [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=94.08s)]
*  But today's decision from the Supreme Court [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=100.08s)]
*  Well quote no pun intended it trumps those rulings and states had no business with this issue in the first place [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=102.63999999999999s)]
*  And even the courts well liberal justices agreed now [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=110.12s)]
*  This would have created nothing but complete chaos in Colorado if Colorado had done this and gotten away with this and again [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=114.04s)]
*  It was a slam dunk, but what's extremely alarming is the left's reaction? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look at their collective meltdown today following this nine zero decision watch [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=126.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court handed Trump a second gift in as many weeks on a constitutional technicality [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=132.44s)]
*  There are a lot of Americans out there [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=137.76s)]
*  They're just their blood is boiling over what Donald Trump did on January 6 what he did leading up to January 6 [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=139.2s)]
*  And they they just think that he's just getting let off the hook Scott free left and right the Supreme Court has just said it's up [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=145.32s)]
*  To Congress so what have they done well? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=151.44s)]
*  They've put it in the capable hands of folks like Jim Jordan James Comer Marjorie Taylor green Matt Gates and others [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=153.8s)]
*  I'm glad we're a nation of the rule of law and the highest court in the United States has ruled on this and that is important [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=161.44s)]
*  Right. We are still right now effectively a democracy, but in the court of public opinion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=167.48s)]
*  Trump will take this spin it spread the misinformation disinformation on it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=172.84s)]
*  I think the Supreme Court has issued bad decisions on democracy and here we have in this context [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=177.48s)]
*  Right a hesitance. That's a reticence a refusal to hold this man accountable [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=185.32s)]
*  unfortunately for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=192.0s)]
*  America [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=193.72s)]
*  The court isn't necessarily wrong that this is the way the framers wanted it to be I had far too much [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=194.8s)]
*  hope [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  That the court would be united in this and not overstep in favor of Donald Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=202.68s)]
*  And I think what we saw was a court where justices that behaved in a partisan manner [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  Now in the majority opinion the justices did acknowledge that a disqualification for quote insurrection can occur [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=215.84s)]
*  But only when Congress enacts necessary legislation and of course some House Democrats well predictably immediately floated the idea [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=223.18s)]
*  Here's what the radical Democrats socialist Jamie Raskin had to say watch the Supreme Court punted and said it's up to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=231.22s)]
*  Congress to act and so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=238.82s)]
*  I am working with a number of my colleagues including [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=241.22s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Swalwell to revive legislation that we had to set up a process [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=244.66s)]
*  By which we could determine that someone who committed insurrection is disqualified by section 3 of the 14th amendment and the House of Representatives [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=251.38000000000002s)]
*  Already impeached Donald Trump for participating in insurrection by inciting it. So the house is already pronounced upon that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=259.98s)]
*  This is just another pathetic desperate ploy from the left to interfere in the election and take Trump down by any means necessary [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=268.58s)]
*  It is important to note must we must all remember with all the legal hurdles that they have thrown at Donald Trump the former president [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=276.22s)]
*  He's never even been charged with insurrection [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=284.18s)]
*  Which has a criminal statute if you want the specifics it is title 18 US code [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=287.5s)]
*  2383 that reads whoever incites sets on foot assists or engages in any rebellion or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  Insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof or gives aid and comfort there too [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  Shall be fined under this title or in prison not more than ten years or both and shall be [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=308.14s)]
*  Incapable of holding any office under the United States. That simply means that even Joe Biden's weaponized DOJ [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=314.38s)]
*  They didn't even charge him never mind convict him with all of this likely knowing that they'd never get a conviction [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=321.66s)]
*  But thankfully today the Supreme Court issued the correct decision and preserved the integrity of the Republican primary process [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=329.18s)]
*  It's been a very busy few days in the court system [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=336.82s)]
*  Well earlier today also the Supreme Court put the new Texas immigration law [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=339.46s)]
*  on hold until March 13th and on Friday a federal appeals court panel ruled that some January 6th [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  Defendants had their sentences improperly lengthened. All right a lot of news today. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4DpRyt2Gc&t=352.26s)]
