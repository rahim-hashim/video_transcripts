# 'FEELS GOOD': Trump talks his return to office
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A)
*  And now more of my interview with President Trump from the Oval Office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=0.0s)]
*  This is serious. I mean Israel's fighting a seventh-front war. October 7th happens. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=4.32s)]
*  You made it clear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=10.32s)]
*  all hell will break loose in the Middle East if they don't start releasing these hostages. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=12.16s)]
*  They did the day before you were inaugurated. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=16.88s)]
*  It's only for that reason. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=18.68s)]
*  The sources I have and the people that I talk to, pretty smart people, and what I read [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=20.44s)]
*  says Iran may be three, four, five, six months away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=27.44s)]
*  There's only, I think the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=33.04s)]
*  I'm not the commander-in-chief you are. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=36.64s)]
*  There's only two solutions that I see, is to knock out their finances, which would be their refineries, and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=39.28s)]
*  Israel and or the United States has to recognize they can never get a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=46.28s)]
*  That would mean taking out those sites. Is that something? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  I know you will not telegraph what you might do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=59.12s)]
*  Of course you wouldn't. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=59.62s)]
*  I can't. I would never tell you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=60.12s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you see this as a possible necessity? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  Had the election been fair, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=64.2s)]
*  we would have had a deal within one week after the election, and they wouldn't have had a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=66.48s)]
*  And the only thing I've said about Iran, and I want them to have a great country, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=71.52s)]
*  they have great potential, the people are amazing, the only thing I said about Iran, they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=74.84s)]
*  And they are religious. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=79.84s)]
*  Will you discuss? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=81.84s)]
*  They are religious. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=82.34s)]
*  Do you trust them? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=83.84s)]
*  I don't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=84.34s)]
*  There are ways that you can make it absolutely certain if you make a deal with someone. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=86.58s)]
*  Trust will verify. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=90.98s)]
*  You have to verify times ten. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=91.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=93.86s)]
*  But they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=94.36s)]
*  And you know, if they get one, you're gonna have everyone else getting them, and then the whole thing is gonna be a disaster. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=97.66s)]
*  The nuclear, you know, I was dealing at the very end, I was dealing with Putin, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=104.38s)]
*  about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=109.78s)]
*  the denuclearization [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=111.58000000000001s)]
*  of Russia and the United States, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=114.5s)]
*  and then we were gonna bring China along on that one because they have much less than we do. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=116.5s)]
*  China, believe it or not, has much less. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=121.78s)]
*  They will have an equal amount in five years, six years, you know, they're trying to get there, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=123.78s)]
*  unfortunately, but right now they have much less in terms of nuclear. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=129.34s)]
*  I was very close to having a deal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=133.58s)]
*  I would have made a deal with Putin on that denuclearization. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=135.58s)]
*  It's very dangerous and very expensive, okay, both. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=139.78s)]
*  And that would have been great, but we had a bad election that interrupted us, and that's why I'm here now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=144.06s)]
*  You seem prepared to talk to all of them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=150.06s)]
*  I won't take any more of your time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  Feel good to be back? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=154.78s)]
*  It does. It feels good, not because I want to be here, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=156.18s)]
*  but because I want to solve some problems that really have developed into problems. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=160.1s)]
*  You know, when I left we had no wars, we had no inflation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=163.78s)]
*  We were riding high and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  Look at what's happened to our country and now we have to get people out of our country that would have never been here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=170.18s)]
*  So I want to I want to do what's best for our country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  It's the most important thing to you. You're willing to go through all of that, all that persecution [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=179.3s)]
*  to get back to this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, I saw what was happening. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=186.9s)]
*  I mean, you look at people pouring into this country and you know, and they're being reported, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  where you're seeing major terrorists, you know, are now in our country and they knew that this was happening and they did nothing about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=193.73999999999998s)]
*  They had an open borders policy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=201.94s)]
*  When you have countries emptying their jails and their mental institutions into our country, when you have a country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=204.17999999999998s)]
*  that's taking gang members off the street and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=210.82s)]
*  dropping them into our country, you know nothing good is going to happen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=213.7s)]
*  You're watching all this, but you do realize you put it all on the line. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=217.54s)]
*  It was back here in the White House. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=222.34s)]
*  I think it's right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=224.34s)]
*  Or I think they would have tried to put you in jail. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=225.7s)]
*  Oh, I think so. Right. You had a deranged Jack Smith, a total moron. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=228.82s)]
*  You had a guy deranged Jack Smith. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=232.34s)]
*  He was looking for something and he's done it in the past with people, but he's a failure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=234.74s)]
*  He's a total failure and he failed in the past also. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=240.74s)]
*  You know why? Because he goes too far. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=243.94s)]
*  And he went too far. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=247.06s)]
*  And the people of our country knew it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=249.14s)]
*  And I actually think they got it better than anybody else, you know? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=252.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=257.06s)]
*  As a whole, they're brilliant. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=257.62s)]
*  And in spite of a media that was selling this every day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=260.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We have a very corrupt media. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=264.02s)]
*  Hopefully that's going to change. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  Great to see you. Congratulations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNd1JDAqq0A&t=267.62s)]
