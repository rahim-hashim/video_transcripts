# This is the most grotesque election interference we've ever seen: Ted Cruz
**Fox News:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04)
*  Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us. Senator, I'll throw that to you. It looks like every [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=0.0s)]
*  case is falling apart. However, regardless of how bad this case is in New York, I don't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=5.8s)]
*  think Donald Trump can get a fair trial there, not with a judge that frankly should have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=11.92s)]
*  recused himself for a hundred different reasons. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=16.64s)]
*  No, he can't get a fair trial in New York. This judge is a hard left partisan. This prosecutor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=19.28s)]
*  is a hard left partisan. The last trial in New York, the judge was a hard left partisan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=24.76s)]
*  The prosecutor was a hard left partisan. This is all about, number one, attacking Donald [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=29.28s)]
*  Trump because they hate his guts. But number two, look, the real target here is not Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  The real target is the American voter. The real target is democracy. This is all about [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=38.56s)]
*  stopping the voters from reelecting Donald Trump as president in November. And this is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=43.02s)]
*  election interference writ large. It is the most grotesque example of trying to interfere [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  in an election we've ever seen. And we see it at the at the Biden Department of Justice [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=52.6s)]
*  that is weaponized, that is attacking their opponents. We see it with district DAs, elected [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=57.16s)]
*  DAs, Democrats, whether in New York or Georgia, they're willing to abuse their power to stop [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  the voters. And I got to say, look, the judge yesterday was talking about throwing Donald [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=69.44s)]
*  Trump in jail because he's daring to exercise his First Amendment rights and speak out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=75.28s)]
*  I talked today on my podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz. The entire podcast is on that question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=80.92s)]
*  Will this judge throw Trump in jail? The short answer is I believe the answer is no. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=86.6s)]
*  I don't think the judge will keep putting fines on him, but I don't think he'll put [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=91.0s)]
*  him in jail. I think if he tried to put him in jail, I think the Court of Appeals would [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=94.08s)]
*  reverse it. They're not going to let Trump go to jail in the middle of this election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, if miracle of miracle, the corrupt New York courts did actually send [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  Trump to jail, Trump would win over 300 electoral votes in November. You want to talk about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=106.96s)]
*  shocking the voters that this is garbage. That would do it. And these people are so [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=112.92s)]
*  consumed with partisan hate that they're willing to abuse power and that willingness has no [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  limits. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=124.84s)]
*  There are allegations that the judge's family can benefit from the outcome in this case, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=125.84s)]
*  a gag order that only applies to Trump, but nobody else involved in the case. They're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=130.36s)]
*  on cable news. They're all over social media. They're begging for gifts, money from people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=135.16s)]
*  They could say whatever the hell they want. The statute of limitations in the past. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=142.08s)]
*  One of the prosecutors was a paid political consultant for the DNC. I mean, this is a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=145.72s)]
*  kangaroo court. This is a political persecution and it's not about crimes. If his name were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Smith, this case would have never been brought. The reason this is brought is they're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=156.44s)]
*  trying to bootstrap a non-federal violation into a non-state violation and they're trying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=160.68s)]
*  to get this attenuated. And by the way, the testimony of Stormy Daniels that was salacious, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=168.2s)]
*  that was the point of it. Listen, there is no person on planet earth that believes Donald [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=173.2s)]
*  Trump has been celibate all his life. That is not news, but they want to drag him through [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  the gutter because this is a political smear job. It's not about the rule of law and it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  frankly it's tragic what is happening because the rule of law is important. It protects [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  all of us. This is what banana republics do. And let me ask you, Sean, is there one Democrat [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=195.52s)]
*  nationally with the courage to speak out against it? I'm in the Senate. I do not know a single [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=202.24s)]
*  Democrat senator who says enough is enough and they are tearing down the constitution [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  and the rule of law because their partisan hatred, their desire for power is more important [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=213.72s)]
*  to them than anything else. They're shredding the constitution before our very eyes, senator. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=218.56s)]
*  We'll have you back soon. Oh, I've learned an awful lot about your opponent that had [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=224.84s)]
*  pretty radical views in the past. They're starting to come to surface. We'll get to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=229.44s)]
*  that. Senator Cruz, thank you for being with us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQD504_ai04&t=234.4s)]
