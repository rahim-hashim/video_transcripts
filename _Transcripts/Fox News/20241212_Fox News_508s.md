# Hannity: This is the Biden admin’s ‘biggest lie of all’
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, well, you just can't trust your own eyes, your own ears, and pictures, and [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=1.28s)]
*  videos, or at least that's the message from the Biden administration, after saying almost [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=5.92s)]
*  nothing about the hoards of bus-sized, sophisticated, very loud flying objects spotted at very low [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=11.4s)]
*  altitudes almost every single night in New Jersey, now New York and Pennsylvania, since [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=18.34s)]
*  November the 18th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  The administration is now saying that it probably is not happening at all. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  According to John Kirby, you just can't believe your lying eyes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=31.04s)]
*  What you see there, it's not real. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=34.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=36.6s)]
*  Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=38.36s)]
*  we have not been able to, and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=45.08s)]
*  corroborate any of the reported visual sightings. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Now remember, the Biden administration, they would never lie to you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=54.6s)]
*  So give them credit, give them the benefit of the doubt, except they did lie about that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=57.72s)]
*  Chinese spy balloon thing, you might recall, and not leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  They did abandon many of them and our allies also. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=67.88s)]
*  And they did lie about inflation being transitory, but don't hold against them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=72.0s)]
*  And they did deny and lie about Biden being sharp as a tack and his cognitive decline. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=76.8s)]
*  But maybe the biggest lie of all was about the border, because for years, the Biden White [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=83.64s)]
*  House, Mayorkas, Kamala Harris, Joe, everybody across the board, they said the border was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=90.32s)]
*  secure and the border was closed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=95.0s)]
*  Everyone on earth knew they were lying. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=97.44s)]
*  The illegal immigrants from all over the world, over 180 countries, pouring into Mexico, walking [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=100.0s)]
*  into the U.S., unvetted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  And now as Biden is leaving people, leaving people continue, they are pouring into the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=108.44s)]
*  country in record numbers right now, unvetted, of course. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  I talk my words here, and I'm very serious, and I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Biden and Harris's horrible legacy will be far worse when one of these unvetted illegal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=122.44s)]
*  immigrants that they have allowed into this country, we have known terrorists in the country, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=129.0s)]
*  carries out a terror attack on our country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  And I know it's going to happen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=137.0s)]
*  It's not when. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=140.16s)]
*  It's not, it's when, it's not if. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=141.64s)]
*  And when, and that, if that happens, and I pray I'm wrong. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=144.84s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=148.16s)]
*  They will have more blood on their hands, a lot more. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=149.72s)]
*  Now this is a nightmare waiting to unfold. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=152.72s)]
*  And the images, they have been horrific. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=155.8s)]
*  Illegal immigrants under bridges, living in tents, sleeping on sidewalks, pouring across [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  the border by the thousands every day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=162.8s)]
*  Instead of protecting our country and our borders from cartels, traffickers, murderers, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=166.8s)]
*  terrorists, rapists and other dangerous criminals, border patrol agents, they were all too busy [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=172.8s)]
*  just processing these unvetted illegals, releasing them into the country or flying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=177.76s)]
*  them directly into the country by the millions, all told more than 12 million unvetted Harris [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=183.2s)]
*  Biden illegal immigrants entered the country in the last four years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Now that we, these are people that we know about. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=193.0s)]
*  That is more than the entire population of New York City. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  These so-called gotaways slipped through undetected, including all these people that I've been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=200.48s)]
*  mentioning to you all under the current White House, all under Biden and Harris and all [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=205.04s)]
*  happening right before our very eyes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=211.04s)]
*  You see the drug overdoses skyrocketing, more people killed by fentanyl in the last four [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=213.28s)]
*  years than ever before in human history. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=217.68s)]
*  Almost all of it came right across that border. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=220.96s)]
*  Other Americans murdered, raped, assaulted by people who never should have been allowed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=223.84s)]
*  into our country. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=228.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, big cities, small towns all across the country, all of them have suffered needlessly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  from a sudden influx of Harris Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=237.16s)]
*  They need food, they need shelter, they need healthcare, they need education. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  You're paying for it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=245.04s)]
*  2000 miles north of the border, even New York City was struggling to keep up and spending [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=246.28s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars housing illegal immigrants in hotels, three, four-star hotels. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=251.88s)]
*  But in New York City, at least, that insanity is going to come to an end. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=258.8s)]
*  And when Donald Trump's president, all of it will come to an end, as he has said over [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=262.68s)]
*  and over. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=267.6s)]
*  He will seal the border on day one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=268.6s)]
*  That means new walls, new security measures, fewer restrictions on border patrol. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  They'll be able to do their job. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=275.48s)]
*  The end of catch and release, stay in Mexico policy, I'm sure we'll be back, a slew of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=277.24s)]
*  executive orders that will prevent asylum abusers from entering the country. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=282.68s)]
*  Now in Canada, they will now be held accountable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=287.8s)]
*  There will be a massive amount of deportations, even to countries that do not want their own [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=290.48s)]
*  citizens back. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=295.8s)]
*  During an interview for Time magazine and the Person of the Year edition, Donald Trump [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=297.44s)]
*  said he would refuse to do business with countries who won't repatriate their own people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Tariffs, other penalties are also on the table. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=307.2s)]
*  And according to Trump, quote, I will do whatever it takes to get illegal immigrants out of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=310.72s)]
*  our country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=315.52s)]
*  Donald Trump even reportedly plans to lift restrictions on ICE arrests at churches, schools [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=316.52s)]
*  and hospitals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=321.88s)]
*  And now, because of the magnitude of this crisis created by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=323.26s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas, even some Democrats are ready and willing to work with Donald Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=328.2s)]
*  on this effort. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=334.2s)]
*  Shockingly, even Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, he said they're going to have to go through [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=335.76s)]
*  me and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=340.12s)]
*  The mayor recently closed 25 illegal immigrant shelters, and today, Adams met with Trump's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=343.24s)]
*  incoming border czar, Tom Homan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=349.04s)]
*  After the meeting, Adams expressed grave concern for the horrific crisis that was caused by [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=351.36s)]
*  Joe and Kamala. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=356.82s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=357.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=358.82s)]
*  We will not be a safe haven for those who commit violent acts. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=359.82s)]
*  We don't do it for those who are citizens, and we're not going to do it for those who [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=364.24s)]
*  are undocumented. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=369.08s)]
*  We have 500,000 children who have sponsors in this country that we can't find. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=371.0s)]
*  We can't find them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=379.96s)]
*  We don't know if they're doing child labor. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=381.2s)]
*  We don't know if they're doing sex crimes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=383.32s)]
*  We don't know if they're being exploited. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=385.72s)]
*  500,000 children. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=387.88s)]
*  There's a level of hypocrisy that everyone in the states, they want to protect everyone, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=389.8s)]
*  but innocent individuals who are victims of crimes and children. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=393.68s)]
*  I want to support and protect children and innocent people that are victims of crime. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=397.42s)]
*  The days of outright lying, gaslighting, they are over. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=403.82s)]
*  Joe Biden failed our country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=407.18s)]
*  Americans, many are dead. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=409.14000000000004s)]
*  Children are missing because of these terrible policies. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=411.3s)]
*  And now in his final act, Joe Biden is trying to sabotage the incoming Trump administration [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=414.62s)]
*  and hurt our country, frankly, just out of spite. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=420.3s)]
*  Now, it reports today, Biden is now rushing to sell unused border wall material, meaning [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=423.66s)]
*  Donald Trump will have to buy it back at full cost when construction resumes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, his chief of staff is instructing the administration to spend as much money as possible [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=435.38s)]
*  before Donald Trump takes office. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  To boost left-wing causes on his way out. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden signed off on big new contracts with thousands of government workers, and they [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=446.26s)]
*  are speeding judges through confirmation at a record pace. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=450.96s)]
*  They are trying to sell off areas of ANWR. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=454.32s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski, are you paying attention? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAH3dCVO86Q&t=457.44s)]
