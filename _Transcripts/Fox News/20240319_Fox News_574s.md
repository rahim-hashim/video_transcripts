# Sean Hannity: Biden's tour isn't going well
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU)
*  Now we turn to something big, some big news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=0.0s)]
*  Believe it or not, Joe Biden has somehow mustered the energy to embark on a three-day campaign [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=3.04s)]
*  swing through Nevada and Arizona. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=8.6s)]
*  Now, this is one of the longest non-vacation-related trips of Joe Biden's entire presidency, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=11.08s)]
*  believe it or not. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=17.84s)]
*  Needless to say, Biden's big trip, well, out west, is not particularly going well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=18.84s)]
*  Not hard to predict, because that jacked-up Joe, that was a one-day affair. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=23.86s)]
*  Can't expect that to last forever. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=28.52s)]
*  Can't be drinking that much Red Bull. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=30.32s)]
*  It's not healthy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=31.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=32.56s)]
*  You're going to be able to get to, not that anybody wants to get to Los Angeles, but people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=33.56s)]
*  from Los Angeles want to get to Nevada. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=40.28s)]
*  So folks, look, I'm going on too long. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=42.44s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=46.44s)]
*  I also met another mother named Latree. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=47.44s)]
*  Where's Latree? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=59.28s)]
*  Latree, excuse me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=60.28s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=61.28s)]
*  And by the way, you know, I won't go into that, I guess, but let's fly to Toronto or [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=64.28s)]
*  to Berlin or to London or to Rome or any major city in America. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=72.32s)]
*  Union labor and contracts raise everybody's income. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's income. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=83.32s)]
*  Rather than the mumbling, bumbling, stumbling, rambling incoherently, one of Biden's main [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=86.52s)]
*  objectives during his trip is a campaign outreach to Hispanic voters. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  As reported by Axios, quote, President Biden will use a stop at a Mexican restaurant in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=95.96s)]
*  Phoenix to announce a national program to reach Latino voters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=101.55999999999999s)]
*  As his campaign now is rushing to reverse gains, the former President Trump appears [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=105.94s)]
*  to be making huge gains with Hispanic American voters. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=110.58s)]
*  I hate to be the bearer of bad news. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=114.2s)]
*  Joey, I don't think a quick stop at a Mexican restaurant is going to cut it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=116.8s)]
*  Inflation, rising crime, wide open southern border, the fentanyl opioid crisis, human [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=121.4s)]
*  trafficking crisis, the president's failures, well, or president failure, are hurting all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=126.72s)]
*  Americans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=132.0s)]
*  Instead of addressing these issues that are impacting every American, we get shameless [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=133.0s)]
*  pandering. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=138.32s)]
*  You may remember this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=139.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=140.32s)]
*  So say it with me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=141.32s)]
*  See? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=142.32s)]
*  Say, Ploy Duy, the future is ours. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=143.56s)]
*  I was sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home politically. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  The diversity of this community, as distinct as the Bogot√° of the Bronx, as beautiful [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=152.44s)]
*  as the blossoms of Miami, and as unique as the breakfast tacos here in San Antonio. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=160.6s)]
*  I just have one thing to say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=168.68s)]
*  Hang on here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=171.68s)]
*  Alright. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=176.68s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=182.68s)]
*  Dance a little bit, Joe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=183.68s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=184.68s)]
*  That's crazy, my boy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=185.68s)]
*  I tell you what, if I had the talent of any one of these people, I'd be elected president [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=189.68s)]
*  by acclamation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=195.68s)]
*  A disaster in every way imaginable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=198.68s)]
*  But while Biden makes a complete fool out of himself, well, have no, let not your heart [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=201.68s)]
*  be troubled, his campaign and the media mob and other Democrats, they're busy trying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=206.16s)]
*  to distract Americans and use every tool at their disposal, of course, to destroy Trump [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  24-7. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=215.56s)]
*  They don't want to talk about their record because it sucks that bad, but of course that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=216.56s)]
*  would include our own federal government, unelected bureaucrats from Northern Virginia [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=220.84s)]
*  for the most part, and Southern Maryland and Washington, D.C. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=225.56s)]
*  They just loathe Donald Trump and most other Republicans. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=228.56s)]
*  They overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=232.56s)]
*  They give money to Democrats. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=234.8s)]
*  And for many years, they have worked behind the scenes to use all their mighty powers, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=236.4s)]
*  the powers of the federal government against Donald Trump and those who support him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=241.96s)]
*  And this is known and affectionately and rightly called the Deep State. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=246.8s)]
*  Now, in 2017, you may recall the New York Times proclaimed that the Deep State doesn't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=251.24s)]
*  really exist. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=256.44s)]
*  They weren't telling you the truth. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=257.68s)]
*  Now the Times has kind of reversed course. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=259.32s)]
*  They are admitting the Deep State is real and, quote, actually kind of awesome. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=261.64s)]
*  They made this lofty determination. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=267.08s)]
*  How? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=268.92s)]
*  By interviewing an employee at the Planetary Missions Program Office that they track asteroids [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=269.92s)]
*  and a water administrator for the EPA. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=276.64s)]
*  Now, the New York Times would have you believe that the Deep State is all about saving our [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=280.2s)]
*  planet from asteroids and improving water quality. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=286.16s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=289.2s)]
*  They didn't seem to spend any time on the all-powerful three-lettered agencies, the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=290.2s)]
*  ones we talk about, the ones that targeted President Trump, abused their power to go [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=296.2s)]
*  after him and other Republicans. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=301.12s)]
*  They made no mention of DOJ employees who wanted to label angry parents at school board [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  meetings as domestic terrorists, all while giving Antifa a free pass, or the multiple [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=309.32s)]
*  federal agencies that directed social media companies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=314.64s)]
*  Remember, they were meeting weekly in the lead-up to the 2020 election, warning these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=318.16s)]
*  big social media companies they may be victims of a disinformation campaign and it may be [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=322.36s)]
*  about Joe and Hunter Biden. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=327.96s)]
*  And of course, then they also froze Twitter accounts that shared the very true Hunter [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=330.28s)]
*  Biden laptop report from the New York Post in spite of the FBI having confirmed its authenticity [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  in March of 2020. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=340.8s)]
*  And then when Facebook and Twitter both asked the FBI whether it's true or false, they [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=342.56s)]
*  wouldn't give them the truthful answer, because that's the Deep State working on Joe's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  behalf. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=351.92s)]
*  Or don't forget the 50-plus former Intel officials that knew nothing about Hunter's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=352.92s)]
*  laptop, but signed a letter falsely accusing the laptop story of likely being Russian disinformation. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=358.16s)]
*  Nope, it was very real. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=364.08s)]
*  Or the hundreds of officials who knowingly lied and propagated the Russia hoax day in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=366.12s)]
*  and day out for three long years against Donald Trump. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=371.68s)]
*  They knew the truth. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  Or the early morning raid at Moro Lago and stacked felony charges over classified documents [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=376.88s)]
*  against Trump, but no charges for Biden, no charges for Hillary Clinton, no reasonable [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  prosecutor would prosecute. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=388.84s)]
*  And for that, July 2016, Mr. higher honor himself, James Comey. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  And then, of course, no mention of the other conveniently timed criminal and civil charges [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  against Donald Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=401.04s)]
*  Oh, conveniently, all before an election. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  We are 230 days away from the election. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=404.92s)]
*  Now, The New York Times has conveniently turned a blind eye to all of this in order to give [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=407.52s)]
*  their liberal left-wing radical readers a fun talking point and gaslight you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=412.56s)]
*  Anyway, Elon Musk was accurately, just accurately referred to The New York Times as the mouthpiece [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=419.04s)]
*  for the deep state. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  He's correct. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=426.04s)]
*  The truth is clear. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=427.16s)]
*  As we speak, multiple courts, they are now being used as a political weapon. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  Nowhere is this more obvious than in New York, where that far-left judge ordered Donald Trump [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=433.44000000000005s)]
*  to pay a record $454 million bond after unilaterally and arbitrarily deciding that Donald Trump's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=439.12s)]
*  properties in New York and Palm Beach are actually worth a tiny fraction of their true [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  market value. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=453.08s)]
*  We have proven this to you over and over again. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=454.08s)]
*  Now, one prominent businessman is now sounding the alarm, all while irritating one fake news [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  CNN host in the process. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=462.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=464.36s)]
*  There are no half a billion dollar bonds, never been done before, never. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=465.36s)]
*  This law has never been applied. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=471.24s)]
*  Forget about Trump. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  Everything to do with Trump. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcoBOwENqU&t=475.04s)]
