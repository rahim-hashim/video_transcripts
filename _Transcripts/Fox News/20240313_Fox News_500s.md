# Ted Cruz warns terror threat to America is 'enormous'
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY)
*  So, as Robert Herr was testifying on Capitol Hill today, the leaders of our nation's intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=0.0s)]
*  agencies, they were also on the Hill, and that included the FBI Director Christopher [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=7.0s)]
*  Wray, who for now, for the second day in a row, is warning you, the American people, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=11.72s)]
*  that the U.S. is facing perhaps more serious threats right now than at any other time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=16.68s)]
*  Pay attention. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=24.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=25.38s)]
*  I believe that the terrorist threat level that we're contending with right now is at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=26.7s)]
*  a whole other level from an already heightened terrorist threat level that we were seeing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=31.66s)]
*  even before October 7th. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=36.739999999999995s)]
*  And I say that for a variety of reasons. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=39.46s)]
*  First, you've seen a veritable rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=42.54s)]
*  for terrorist attacks against us in a way that we haven't seen in a long, long time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  And these are terrorist organizations, as this committee knows very well, which often [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=53.42s)]
*  don't see eye to eye on much, but they seem to see eye to eye on this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=57.22s)]
*  Now, remember, just yesterday, Christopher Wray warned of a serious threat linked directly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=61.5s)]
*  to ISIS posed by Joe Biden's wide-open southern border. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=66.7s)]
*  Here's a reminder. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=70.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=71.54s)]
*  There is a particular network that has, where some of the overseas facilitators of the smuggling [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=72.54s)]
*  network have ISIS ties that we're very concerned about and that we've been spending an enormous [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=79.56s)]
*  amount of effort with our partners investigating. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=85.5s)]
*  Exactly what that network is up to is something that's, again, the subject of our current [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=90.62s)]
*  investigation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=94.5s)]
*  But sir, is a network we're concerned about that has facilitators involved in it that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  have ties to ISIS and other terrorist organizations? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=100.16s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=103.84s)]
*  Why doesn't Director Wray insist that the laws of our country be enforced? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=105.68s)]
*  And why doesn't he go after a president that is picking and choosing what laws he chooses [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  to enforce and aiding and abetting in the law breaking? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  What is it going to take for the Democratic Party and this president to secure that border? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  Remember, not long ago, many on the left actually believed in borders and preventing illegal [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=124.34s)]
*  immigration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  Here's a case in point. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  Chuck Schumer almost sounds like me in 2009. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=132.62s)]
*  Me today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=136.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=137.02s)]
*  People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=138.02s)]
*  aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S. legally. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=142.76s)]
*  Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=147.4s)]
*  Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=151.66s)]
*  we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=157.32s)]
*  now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  When we use phrases like undocumented workers, we convey a message to the American people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration, which the American [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=171.0s)]
*  people overwhelmingly oppose. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  If you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=179.5s)]
*  I think it is illegal and wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=181.98s)]
*  Here with reaction is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  I would assume that probably he'll be apologizing for using the word illegal, Senator, but this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=187.64s)]
*  is not a laughing matter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=193.6s)]
*  What the FBI director is saying here is this is the worst threat we've had since 9-11. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  This sounds to me like the canary in the coal mine, and he's basically telling this country [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  to prepare for a terror attack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=207.66s)]
*  I have identified Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, also Egypt, Russia and China. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=210.12s)]
*  Why are they coming to our southern border? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=217.56s)]
*  And why doesn't the FBI director insist that Joe Biden stop aiding and abetting in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=219.6s)]
*  law breaking in and force the laws of our country? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=224.46s)]
*  Shouldn't he be insistent? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=228.0s)]
*  Doesn't he have the authority to do that, Senator? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=229.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=231.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=232.88s)]
*  The FBI director is exactly right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=233.88s)]
*  The terror threat to this country is enormous. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=235.76s)]
*  It is greater than it has been at any time since September 11th. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=238.52s)]
*  We've had 10.4 million people cross illegally since Joe Biden became president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  The open borders we have, when I'm down on the southern border, as you know, I spend [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=248.84s)]
*  a lot of time down on the southern border. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  Border Patrol agents are actively looking for Hamas, for Hezbollah, for Palestinian [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  jihad, for terrorists coming across. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=260.56s)]
*  They have called for terrorists to carry out acts like October 7th. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=263.12s)]
*  On October 7th, 1,200 people were murdered in Israel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  And what these terrorists are calling for is the same sort of mass murder here in the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=277.88s)]
*  And Joe Biden and every congressional Democrat, they are complicit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=278.88s)]
*  They refuse to do anything to stop it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=282.32s)]
*  And I'll tell you, even worse than that, it's not even just that Biden and the Democrats [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=284.67999999999995s)]
*  are overwhelmed and they don't know how to stop the flow coming in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=289.2s)]
*  The news just broke in the last two weeks that Joe Biden, the Biden administration, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=293.24s)]
*  actively flew over 320,000 illegal immigrants from their home countries into the United [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=298.56s)]
*  States, into 43 different airports. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=305.92s)]
*  Now, we don't know that because Biden told the American people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=308.44s)]
*  We don't know that because Biden told Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=311.68s)]
*  We know that because of a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  They were forced to acknowledge that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=317.76s)]
*  But they will not tell you what 43 airports they are. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=319.88s)]
*  What cities they're flying people into. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=323.0s)]
*  But understand, they're flying people from Venezuela. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  They're flying people from their home countries into America to come illegally. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=327.84s)]
*  This is an invasion and it's an invasion that Biden and the Democrats want for political [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=333.08s)]
*  reasons. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  And they don't care if people die as a price for their partisan control. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden said he regretted using the term illegal. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  He didn't, he didn't give an apology to Laken Reilly's family when he butchered her name. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=347.36s)]
*  Say her name, Joe. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=352.56s)]
*  It's not Lincoln. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  It's Laken Reilly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Nor have we heard that he even pick up a phone and call them and tell them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=356.52s)]
*  What I'm hearing from the FBI director is it's not if it is when that there are terror [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=360.56s)]
*  cells likely in this country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=365.72s)]
*  I would argue it's I'm 100% right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=367.68s)]
*  I pray I'm 100% wrong. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=370.12s)]
*  I'm not wrong, Senator. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=372.52s)]
*  You're not wrong. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=373.92s)]
*  Director Wray's not wrong. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=375.04s)]
*  It's it's now when not if probably sooner than later. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=376.88s)]
*  Look, look, there are two images, two photographs and images that capture what the what the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=381.8s)]
*  2024 election is all about. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=387.72s)]
*  One image was the illegal immigrants who beat up two New York police officers were released [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=389.6s)]
*  from jail with no bail and they flipped off the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=394.92s)]
*  That's image number one. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=398.8s)]
*  That's the message of Joe Biden and the Democrats to the American people is flipping the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  bird with both hands. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=404.48s)]
*  The second image is right after the State of the Union. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  The next day, Donald Trump, quite rightly, meets with Laken Reilly's family, hugs Laken [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Reilly's family and simultaneously while Trump is hugging the family of this beautiful [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=416.84s)]
*  twenty two year old woman who should still be alive if it were not for Democrat open [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=421.92s)]
*  borders. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=426.4s)]
*  That same day, Joe Biden apologizes not to Laken Reilly, not to her family, not to the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=427.64s)]
*  people who died, but apologizes to the murderer, illegal alien because he called him an [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=433.16s)]
*  illegal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt7G2lqozyY&t=438.28000000000003s)]
