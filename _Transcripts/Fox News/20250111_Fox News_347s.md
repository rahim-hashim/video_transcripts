# Newt Gingrich: Politicians in California 'range between radically stupid and corrupt'
**Fox News:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk)
*  More speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=0.0s)]
*  So let me understand this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=3.6s)]
*  So California is a sanctuary state. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=4.92s)]
*  L.A. is a sanctuary city. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=7.68s)]
*  If you're a drug addict, you get your free needles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=10.18s)]
*  If you are in the state illegally, you get free housing, healthcare, education, all taxpayer-funded. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=13.76s)]
*  If you're homeless, you pretty much get everything for free, too, maybe not the hotels [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  that they're giving out in New York. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=28.24s)]
*  But they can't give the highest tax people in the country the water they need to put [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=30.64s)]
*  out a fire or practice basic science, the basic science of forestry. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=36.08s)]
*  You can get degrees from top universities in forestry. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=43.04s)]
*  Look, I think we need a totally new model. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  I think the federal government should basically impound all the money that it was going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=53.92s)]
*  give California and all the money that it was going to give Los Angeles, translate that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  into help for the people, not the governments, but take all that money so that, in fact, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=64.16s)]
*  we're taking all the money California wanted from the rest of the country and all the money [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=70.4s)]
*  Los Angeles wanted from the rest of the country, converting it into help for the people who [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=75.28s)]
*  have been hurt, hurt precisely because the politicians in California range between radically [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=81.2s)]
*  stupid and corrupt and are controlled by the unions and the bureaucrats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=88.0s)]
*  I think this is a pretty straightforward situation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=93.12s)]
*  We'll never see a clearer example of the total incompetence and destructiveness of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  left-wing government than we are seeing in the fires in Los Angeles tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=103.28s)]
*  If you're going to aid and abet lawbreaking, and that means helping people that don't respect [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=108.32s)]
*  our laws or borders or sovereignty, if you're going to harbor those criminals, if you're going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=114.88s)]
*  to give them free housing, healthcare and education, how about, that would mean you're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=119.6s)]
*  basically aiding and abetting the lawbreaking so therefore you don't deserve one federal dollar. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=125.44s)]
*  How about we insist that you cannot codify into law, lawbreaking, by adopting a sanctuary status? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=130.64s)]
*  Look, I think that President Trump's in a position, given the absurdity of what Biden did today, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=141.92s)]
*  in promising 100 percent federal offset for the cost of the fires, I think the answer ought to be, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=148.32s)]
*  we're going to claw back from the state of California and from the city of Los Angeles [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=155.36s)]
*  all of the money that Biden wants to throw away. We're going to help the people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=161.68s)]
*  I want to draw a distinction. I am absolutely for helping the people who have lost their homes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=166.0s)]
*  I think all Americans have to come together at times like this and help their fellow Americans, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=171.68s)]
*  but I am totally opposed to the windfall profits going to the destructive government of California [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=177.12s)]
*  and the destructive government of Los Angeles. And I think your point's right. If we simply cut [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=183.76s)]
*  off all funding to illegal immigrants and if we simply, frankly, went back to the 1996 welfare [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=188.56s)]
*  reform bill and insisted that if you get money from the federal government, you have to go to work, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=195.6s)]
*  you can't just sit around and be idle and do nothing, I think you could pay for this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=200.88s)]
*  But we should not give California itself a penny. The government of California is corrupt, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=205.28s)]
*  disreputable and follows policies that verge on insane, and the rest of the country shouldn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=212.4s)]
*  be required to subsidize their insanity. We're a week and a half. Donald Trump will be [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=218.08s)]
*  president and he has a bold agenda, transformative agenda. He talked about, you talked about, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=223.84s)]
*  he went to about one big, beautiful bill. He went to the U.S. Senate last night. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=230.56s)]
*  They're talking about two big, beautiful bills. I think it can make a compelling case on each [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=235.76s)]
*  side of that argument. Do you think it should be one? And what do you say to the people that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=242.16s)]
*  believe it should be two? Oh, I think we're crazy if we go for two bills. We need one large, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  decisive bill. We need two and a half months of President Trump and Vice President Vance [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  barnstorming the country. We know exactly the Democrats, and there are about 34 of them, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  who are very vulnerable. And there ought to be a rally in each of their districts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=267.52s)]
*  We ought to combine tax cuts, affordability, better take home pay, bigger job creation, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=272.4s)]
*  lower energy costs with fixing the border, all of them in one bill. And frankly, my good friends [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=279.68s)]
*  in the Senate don't understand that if you're in the House and you're faced with a very close [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=285.52s)]
*  election next year, you need dramatic economic growth. That means, as Speaker Mike Johnson has [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=290.56s)]
*  said, you need a bill by Memorial Day at the very latest. You need a bill by July 4th. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=297.68s)]
*  The two bill model, I think, is an invitation to a disaster. We saw that. I was in Congress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=304.32s)]
*  Ronald Reagan failed to get his tax cuts to start in 82. We lost 26 seats. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=310.8s)]
*  Uh, President Trump failed to convince the leadership to pass the tax cuts first. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=316.56s)]
*  And in 2017, they didn't pass till October. We lost 40 seats, one bill quickly, no later than [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=322.96s)]
*  May or June. Newt Gingrich. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyFAQK2OyWk&t=331.68s)]
