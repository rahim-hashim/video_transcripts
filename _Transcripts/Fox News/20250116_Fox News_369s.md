# Ted Cruz: The Democrats are in a PANIC
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU)
*  Check and mate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=0.0s)]
*  Great job, Pam Bondi. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=2.88s)]
*  The fact that California, you know, they adopt all these environmental laws that prevent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=6.92s)]
*  basic—the basic science of forestry. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  It results in a disaster. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=16.4s)]
*  They elect people like this idiot, a congenital liar, conspiracy theorist. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=18.3s)]
*  And Pam Bondi, you're the one that got censored by Congress for the very same thing that you're [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=23.48s)]
*  bringing up here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=30.0s)]
*  You know what's interesting to me, Senator? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=31.2s)]
*  It seems that the very thing that they fear is what they did, what they did knowingly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=34.2s)]
*  that they knew was wrong, and that was weaponizing the DOJ. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=40.6s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they're concerned about, you know, equal justice and equal application [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=45.08s)]
*  of our laws. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=49.74s)]
*  It's laughable to me, but Pam Bondi gave the correct answer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=50.74s)]
*  Equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=58.32s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=59.72s)]
*  Pam Bondi did a terrific job today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=61.24s)]
*  Pam Bondi is going to be confirmed as attorney general. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=63.44s)]
*  I believe all of President Trump's nominees for the cabinet are going to be confirmed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=66.56s)]
*  And actually this week we've had multiple hearings for about half the cabinet already, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=70.2s)]
*  and they have performed consistently very, very well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=74.6s)]
*  Pete Hegseth yesterday did a superb job. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=77.56s)]
*  I think he'll be confirmed for secretary of defense. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  And I got to see, seeing the Democrats go after Pete, seeing the Democrats go after [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=83.12s)]
*  Pam, they are in panic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=87.44s)]
*  But you can tell from their attacks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=91.08s)]
*  With Pete Hegseth they went into personal slanders and attacks based on anonymous reports [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=92.88s)]
*  because they didn't want to address the substantive job he will do as secretary of defense. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=97.88s)]
*  With Pam Bondi they had very little to say about her long distinguished career as a prosecutor, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=102.3s)]
*  trying violent criminals, serving eight years as the elected attorney general of Florida. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=108.64s)]
*  They couldn't talk about any of that, so they just screamed about Donald Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=112.88s)]
*  And they channeled accusations to her about weaponizing DOJ that I think are frankly laughable [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=116.88s)]
*  because in many ways the most disgraceful aspect of the last four years under Joe Biden [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=123.28s)]
*  has been the absolute politicization and weaponization of the Department of Justice to go after Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=128.42s)]
*  Trump, to go after Biden's enemies, to protect Biden's political allies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=134.16s)]
*  And I believe Pam Bondi is going to come in and restore integrity to the Department of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=139.2s)]
*  Justice. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=143.88s)]
*  What she made clear, what I and others made clear at the hearing is I don't want to see [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=145.16s)]
*  a Republican Department of Justice or a Democrat Department of Justice. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=149.84s)]
*  I want a Department of Justice that follows the damn law regardless of party and I believe [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=153.32s)]
*  that's exactly what Pam Bondi is going to do. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=158.6s)]
*  Okay, I was talking to Speaker Johnson a moment ago and I know that while I would like to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=160.72s)]
*  get one bill and get the economy moving, get everything fixed at once, that would be my [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=168.92s)]
*  desire. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=173.52s)]
*  I understand there are strong arguments on both sides for either one big beautiful bill [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=174.52s)]
*  or two bills. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=179.28s)]
*  I don't think there is consensus yet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  It looks like the House has decided to go with the one bill strategy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=182.88s)]
*  You have maybe thought it would work better in the Senate for two. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=187.32s)]
*  I don't think either one is right and wrong as long as it all gets done and hopefully [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  done as early as possible. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=194.68s)]
*  Where are you at this point on that issue? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=197.32s)]
*  Well, listen, you're right that there is a tactical disagreement between the House [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=200.44s)]
*  and Senate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=204.2s)]
*  The Speaker has argued for doing one bill. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=205.2s)]
*  I think it is much more likely to succeed doing two different bills. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=207.28s)]
*  I got to tell you, just about every Senator agrees that two bills maximizes the chances [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  of success. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  At the end of the day, we'll resolve those questions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=216.6s)]
*  I think what the American people want and expect is that we deliver results. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  There's a mandate that came in November. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=224.2s)]
*  There's a mandate to secure the border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=226.64s)]
*  We got to secure the border. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  There's a mandate to bring back jobs, to unleash American energy, to lower inflation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=229.56s)]
*  There's a mandate to protect this country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=234.68s)]
*  We're going to do all of that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=236.88s)]
*  We're going to extend the Trump tax cuts. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=237.96s)]
*  We're going to repeal job-killing regulations. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=239.68s)]
*  And at the end of the day, whether we do one bill or two, we will get the job done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=241.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I think every Republican in the Senate is committed to doing that, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=247.8s)]
*  and I think every Republican in the House is as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=251.28s)]
*  We're going to work hand in hand with the president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=253.76s)]
*  And now is the time for us to roll up our sleeves and deliver on our promises, because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=256.32s)]
*  the stakes are too high to do anything else. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=261.12s)]
*  Are you that convinced that every part of the Trump agenda, whether one bill or two [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  bills will be passed, let's say, by Memorial Day the latest? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=270.06s)]
*  Well, look, I think if we try to do one giant bill, I think we increase the chances of failure. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=273.68s)]
*  That's why I think that that is a mistaken strategy, because the more complicated it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=279.56s)]
*  gets. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=284.36s)]
*  Listen, a few weeks ago, we had a continuing resolution that was widely criticized for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=285.36s)]
*  being too big. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  And now folks are suggesting, well, let's have the biggest bill just cram everything [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=291.24s)]
*  in there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that is risky. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  What I think makes sense is start with a bill to secure the border, to rebuild our military [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=297.36s)]
*  and to unleash energy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=302.82s)]
*  We can get widespread agreement on that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=303.92s)]
*  And then later, let's extend the tax cuts and unleash the American economy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=306.2s)]
*  Again, I think we can come together and avoid a $4 trillion tax increase. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=312.2s)]
*  Whatever tactic we use, we've got to deliver results. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  That's my focus. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=320.2s)]
*  I think it is critical that that part get done sooner than later. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  The economy get put on track sooner than later, because that will impact certainly the midterm [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=325.46s)]
*  elections. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=332.12s)]
*  Reagan, I felt, got his economic policies in place a little late. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=333.12s)]
*  I think unfortunately that delayed the recovery, but what a massive recovery we had. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  21 million new jobs created, longest period of peacetime economic growth. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  These policies implemented, getting done, have to be critical. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=347.8s)]
*  I hope everyone stays on the same page. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  Senator Cruz, thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljjaUGMqTU&t=356.96000000000004s)]
