# Kristi Noem: Trump will win regardless of what Colorado does
**Fox News:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats are in panic mode heading into 2024, as Joe Biden's poll numbers continue to plummet [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=3.44s)]
*  nationwide and in the swing states. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=10.0s)]
*  So, what's the left's game plan? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=13.36s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Change the rules. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=18.0s)]
*  And kick their opponent off the ballot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Earlier today, President Biden declined to comment on the Colorado Supreme Court's decision, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=22.6s)]
*  but asserted that Trump supported an insurrection. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=29.16s)]
*  He's absolutely sure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=32.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=34.16s)]
*  I don't know whether the fourth amendment applies or let the court make that decision, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=35.16s)]
*  but he certainly supported an insurrection. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=39.16s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=41.16s)]
*  None. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=43.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=44.16s)]
*  And he seems to be doubling down on about everything. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=45.16s)]
*  Of course, Trump hasn't been charged or convicted of an insurrection, but the left celebrated [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=49.16s)]
*  the court's vast overreach in Colorado. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=53.8s)]
*  Turns out not everyone is on board. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=57.16s)]
*  2024 independent candidate, RFK Jr., warned the decision could lead to problems down the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=59.16s)]
*  road. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=66.16s)]
*  And South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said what they're doing in Colorado is Biden's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=67.16s)]
*  only hope of winning the election in November. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=72.16s)]
*  Joining us to tell us more, Governor Noem. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=75.16s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=79.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=80.16s)]
*  Good evening, Kellyanne. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=81.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=82.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for inviting me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=83.16s)]
*  I appreciate being with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=84.16s)]
*  Well, Governor, I think it's a very important point you make. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=85.16s)]
*  And RFK Jr., of all people, took to X, formerly known as Twitter, and really gave a robust [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=88.16s)]
*  defense of the people, said that we can't let the courts and political manipulation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=93.16s)]
*  decide our presidents. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=97.16s)]
*  That right belongs to the people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=98.16s)]
*  But as a governor, what would you say if your highest court was to deny someone access to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=100.16s)]
*  the ballot? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=106.16s)]
*  Well, what they're doing is unconstitutional, and it has no grounds. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=108.16s)]
*  And he is what you said earlier, Kellyanne, and that was that he hasn't been charged [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=112.16s)]
*  or convicted at all of insurrection. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=116.16s)]
*  And so it's interesting that the Colorado Supreme Court has used this as the basis for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=119.16s)]
*  their reason for removing him from the ballot. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=123.16s)]
*  So that's the hypocrisy that we're seeing right here of how they're trying to work the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=125.16s)]
*  system in a very unfair way because they're so concerned, the left is so concerned about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=130.16s)]
*  losing this election to President Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=137.16s)]
*  And he will win. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=139.16s)]
*  Make no mistake, regardless of what Colorado does and what their Supreme Court decides, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=140.16s)]
*  that President Trump will win the primary election, he'll win the general election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=144.16s)]
*  And that's because of the left consistently taking extreme measures like this and degrading [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=148.16s)]
*  our society and destroying America from its foundation and up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=154.16s)]
*  And if he does win again, I'm sure he'll return to Mount Rushmore to be with you and everyone [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=157.16s)]
*  else in South Dakota for a July 4th celebration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=162.16s)]
*  So, Governor Noem, would you be able to bar Biden from the ballot in your state of South [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=165.16s)]
*  Dakota if, say, he violated that part of the 14th Amendment by unfreezing assets for Iran [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=170.16s)]
*  or allowed terrorists to just openly walk over the southern border? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=176.16s)]
*  I mean, do you think that you'd have that power or your highest court would have that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=180.16s)]
*  power? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=184.16s)]
*  You know, I don't believe so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=185.16s)]
*  That's what is so interesting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=188.16s)]
*  It's, you know, the process that the court has is a balance to our federal government. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=190.16s)]
*  It is a balance to our executive branch, a balance to our legislative branch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=194.16s)]
*  You know, so us exerting the kind of influence on the court and their decisions to take that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=198.16s)]
*  kind of action is really unprecedented. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=203.16s)]
*  So I trust our South Dakota state laws, our Constitution. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=206.16s)]
*  It gives great guidance to us and our court system understands that their job is to follow [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=210.16s)]
*  statute and give decisions based on the scales of justice. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=216.16s)]
*  I'm very proud of what we do here in South Dakota. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=220.16s)]
*  I would be hopeful that other states would do that and not let liberal judges rewrite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=223.16s)]
*  the rules of the game to work for their political interests. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=227.16s)]
*  This is where the Supreme Court will should and I hope will take quick action, strong [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=230.16s)]
*  action to reverse this decision at the lower court and make sure that they do the right [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=236.16s)]
*  thing by the American people and make sure their voices are heard. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=241.16s)]
*  President Trump will win. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=244.16s)]
*  And my hope is that they allow this election to be held fairly and let the people weigh [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=245.16s)]
*  in and to choose the president that they want in the White House. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=250.16s)]
*  And Governor Noem, in light of yesterday's Colorado Supreme Court decision, many around [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=253.16s)]
*  President Trump, but many others are crying election interference. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  We know all about voter exclusion, voter intimidation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  This almost seems like voter elimination, supplanting the will of the people with a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  judicial, with judicial imperiousness. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  It just also strikes some people, Governor Noem, something we're both familiar with, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  that conservatives or center-right voters, Trump supporters being called deplorable, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  irredeemable, mega-mega, now they're being castigated and denigrated in a different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=279.16s)]
*  way that they can't possibly be wise and judicious in their presidential selection. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=284.16s)]
*  So the Supreme Court of Colorado must do it for them by kicking someone off the ballot. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=290.16s)]
*  But what do you think of that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=295.16s)]
*  I'm sure you hear from people all the time that feel shadow banned and censored and canceled. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=296.16s)]
*  How does this play into that, if at all? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=301.16s)]
*  You know, I see both sides of it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=304.16s)]
*  I see people consistently seeing the hypocrisy and the corruption that is happening from [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=306.16s)]
*  the left and how they're using this against people that are their enemies in their agenda [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=312.16s)]
*  that they want to pursue. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=317.16s)]
*  But I also would say, though, Kellyanne, is the more this stuff happens, the more they [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=319.16s)]
*  normalize it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=323.16s)]
*  The more often that they use our judicial system and our Supreme Court to play these [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=324.16s)]
*  political games, to go out and to fundamentally rewrite justice, the more it becomes normal [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=329.16s)]
*  in America. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=336.16s)]
*  And that's what is so dangerous, is because the more often you see something, the more [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=337.16s)]
*  you don't blink at it the next time that it happens. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=341.16s)]
*  The more it seems like, oh, well, that's just something that happens. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=344.16s)]
*  That is increasing so often now in the last year or two where we have our courts being [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=346.16s)]
*  used to punish political opponents in a way that I just don't remember seeing five years [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=352.16s)]
*  ago, six years ago. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=358.16s)]
*  Now it's being used on a daily basis. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=359.16s)]
*  I believe that's dangerous for our way of life because that then becomes normal to the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=361.16s)]
*  American people and they start to think that that is something that is okay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=366.16s)]
*  It is not okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=370.16s)]
*  That's what's made America special for so many generations is the fact that we were a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=371.16s)]
*  country of freedom. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=376.16s)]
*  We were a country of the people, a republic where they get to decide. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=378.16s)]
*  We don't live by dictatorships or a direction of an elite few making the decisions for the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=382.16s)]
*  people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=387.16s)]
*  Our motto in South Dakota is under God, the people rule. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=388.16s)]
*  We enforce that every day by following our Constitution. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=391.16s)]
*  I would hope in the United States of America we remember what our Constitution says as [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=395.16s)]
*  well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=398.16s)]
*  Fortunately, millions and millions of Americans agree with those very points. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=399.16s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=402.16s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-7J9ttEh4&t=405.16s)]
