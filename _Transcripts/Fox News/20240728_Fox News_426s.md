# Mike Huckabee: We’re dealing with a ‘cover-up’
**Fox News:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw)
*  Also breaking tonight, our very own Brian Yennis has obtained this photo that a rally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=0.0s)]
*  goer took of the gunman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=5.92s)]
*  Take a look at this right there, on the roof, before he began shooting, as well as a video [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=8.08s)]
*  that shows the chaos that ensued after the shooter was spotted and began shooting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=12.88s)]
*  You can actually hear the gunman's eight shots and then the two sniper shots, the counter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=18.38s)]
*  shots fired back at him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=23.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=25.76s)]
*  Get out of here! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=26.76s)]

*  Get out of here! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=56.76s)]
*  It is a miracle Donald Trump is alive today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=58.76s)]
*  Also breaking today, ten days after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and after a heated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=62.44s)]
*  hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, finally, finally, finally, the Secret Service Director, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=68.44s)]
*  Kimberly Cheadle, by the way, Joe, Kim is a woman, not a guy, has resigned in her resignation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=74.72s)]
*  letter sent to the Secret Service this morning. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=82.18s)]
*  Cheadle says she takes, quote, full responsibility for the security lapse. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  And while we wait for Joe Biden to appoint a new director, the Washington Post is reporting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=89.42s)]
*  that the Secret Service is encouraging the Trump campaign to only hold indoor rallies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=94.18s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and former Arkansas Governor Mike [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=100.42000000000002s)]
*  Huckabee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  Jason, let's start with you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  This is your wheelhouse. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  You've investigated the Secret Service before. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  This is a security failure of historic proportions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=112.98s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=115.98s)]
*  And completely unnecessary. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=117.9s)]
*  Total and complete lapse. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=122.74s)]
*  She should have been fired, not resigned. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=125.32s)]
*  The Secret Service, they've got good men and women. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=129.12s)]
*  They are totally being failed by their leadership in every single step of the way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=131.2s)]
*  But we've highlighted hundreds of times that the Secret Service has failed to do its mission. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=135.84s)]
*  It's thank goodness for Senator Grassley and local law enforcement to put that out there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=142.24s)]
*  because not only is the Secret Service not doing their job, but guess what? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=145.16s)]
*  They are out there deceiving the public in what's happening. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=149.8s)]
*  Why haven't they held a single press conference? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=153.32s)]
*  The only press conference that was out there was done by the locals. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=155.76s)]
*  And then the things they told us were lies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=158.76s)]
*  They said they didn't know the name of the shooter. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=160.64s)]
*  They did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  They said he was 20 years old. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  How'd they know he was 20 years old if they didn't know the name of the shooter? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  And then they go out and they say, well, there's no ongoing threat. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  How do you know there's no ongoing threat? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=169.9s)]
*  You don't even know the name of the shooter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  Then they go out and say the pitched roof. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=175.1s)]
*  So why can't they come clean? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas should also be held accountable for this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=178.6s)]
*  And for them to suggest that Donald Trump has to hold indoor rallies, I mean, it's like [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=181.89999999999998s)]
*  a referee saying, will you stop scoring so many touchdowns because we're tired of running [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=186.7s)]
*  up and down the field? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=190.7s)]
*  Donald Trump attracts tens of thousands of people anywhere and everywhere he goes, not [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=192.38s)]
*  the 75 people that show up for a Kamala Harris rally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=197.62s)]
*  So get your act together. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=201.66s)]
*  That extraction that you're seeing right there, that was one of the most pathetic displays. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=203.68s)]
*  You got a president, a former president, shot and they can't get him out of there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=208.4s)]
*  Look at those bumbling. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how do you open up the gate? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Ram the gate, get the guy to the hospital and do your flipping job. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=216.26s)]
*  You know, the silence of Joe and Kamala has been near deafening, Governor Huckabee. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=221.78s)]
*  Why didn't they fire him? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=226.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, her? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=228.12s)]
*  Why didn't they fire the head of the Secret Service? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=229.68s)]
*  Why didn't they hire the people that did advance work on this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=233.96s)]
*  Why didn't they fire the people that said, oh, it's a pitch roof or a sloped roof? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=236.98s)]
*  That's not a sloped roof by definition, Governor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=241.78s)]
*  As somebody who used to do roofing, that's not a sloped roof. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=244.88s)]
*  You could stand on that roof. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=248.4s)]
*  You could skate on that roof. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=249.6s)]
*  You could do pretty much anything you want on that roof. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=251.2s)]
*  Well, the sad thing, what was done on that roof was to shoot a former president and future [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=254.54s)]
*  president Donald Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=259.46s)]
*  And the reason that she wasn't fired, that Joe Biden didn't fire him, I don't know that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=261.5s)]
*  he was too aware of all that was going on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=266.02s)]
*  But the other tragedy that was going on here was that Kim Cheadle knew answers, stood before [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Congress and wouldn't give the answers that she knew. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=275.54s)]
*  Thank God for Chuck Grassley for releasing more information in a tweet than Kim Cheadle [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  has released since the shooting 10 days ago. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=284.36s)]
*  And for her to keep saying, well, it's only been nine days when she was there yesterday. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  The fact is, most of the time when there's a mass shooting, there's a press conference [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  within two or three hours, and every police agency shows up and gives a perspective. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  This has been the most stonewall thing ever. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  And we've often heard the phrase, the only thing worse than the crime is the coverup. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, we're dealing with a coverup here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=308.68s)]
*  This is not just they don't know what happened. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=309.68s)]
*  They're covering it up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  They're hoping we forget. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  We will not forget. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=314.68s)]
*  We will continue to demand answers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=316.06s)]
*  And I agree with Jason wholeheartedly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=318.3s)]
*  The idea that the Secret Service is now going to tell Donald Trump what kind of venues he [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=320.08s)]
*  can hold a rally, that's absurd. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=324.26s)]
*  Their job is to protect him, not to direct the campaign. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was like the 10-day long investigation into cocaine in the White House, Jason, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=330.0s)]
*  after that long investigation, they gave up saying, we don't think we'll ever find out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=336.18s)]
*  who did it there, who brought in the cocaine to the White House. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=340.42s)]
*  You know, I've got to take issue with one other thing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  When Kim Cheadle and others make the case that, well, it was outside the perimeter, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  by definition, the perimeter, you define it as any place where any harm can be brought [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  to the person that you are protecting. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=361.06s)]
*  That's the perimeter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  The perimeter is not 130 feet away outside of where the rally is being held. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=365.64s)]
*  No, because that would be a layup. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  That would be a one-foot putt in terms of taking a shot. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=372.88s)]
*  You know, between Obama, Biden and Biden-Harris, they have now been through five Secret Service [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=379.92s)]
*  directors. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8knshlysw&t=385.44s)]
