# James Comer: The Bidens can't answer this simple question
**Fox News:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=0.0s)]
*  The mainstream media likes to pretend there is no evidence Joe [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=2.74s)]
*  Biden did anything wrong when it comes to Hunter's business deals. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=6.2s)]
*  But now legal experts are warning that Biden could be in serious trouble. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=9.98s)]
*  Law professor Jonathan Turley says that if Joe knew his family was engaged [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  in influence peddling, then he is corrupt by definition. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=18.56s)]
*  And our own Greg Jarrett thinks Biden's misdeeds could even force Joe [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=22.38s)]
*  out of the presidential race. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=26.0s)]
*  Of course, more evidence will come to light as the House impeachment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=27.92s)]
*  investigation continues. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=31.5s)]
*  And here now with the latest on that effort is House Oversight Committee [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=33.36s)]
*  Chairman James Comer. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=37.56s)]
*  Merry Christmas. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=39.7s)]
*  I want you to know you are my second favorite House Committee Oversight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=41.24s)]
*  Committee Chairman there's ever been. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=45.64s)]
*  Just so you get that off my chest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=47.34s)]
*  The second best one ever. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  I wish you worked for the Washington Post or something. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=51.22s)]
*  That'll never happen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=56.22s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=57.36s)]
*  Listen, one of the things that I just laugh about every time I see here [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=58.96s)]
*  the mainstream media, there's no evidence that Joe Biden has done [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  anything wrong. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=66.7s)]
*  But the money that's been flowing into the Biden family business and all [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=68.66s)]
*  those around him without a product other than Joe Biden is absolutely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=72.6s)]
*  stunning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=77.44s)]
*  When people ask you that question, how do you respond to them? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=78.44s)]
*  I think most Americans realize that something stinks here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=83.84s)]
*  Most Americans realize that we've provided bank statements as hard [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=87.0s)]
*  evidence, statements that show the Bidens have received well over $20 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=91.04s)]
*  million from our enemies around the world. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=95.34s)]
*  And they can't answer a simple question. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=98.04s)]
*  What did you do to receive the money? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=99.72s)]
*  They also know that Joe Biden stated during the campaign he never met with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=101.78s)]
*  any of these people who send his family money and that he had a wall [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=105.92s)]
*  between the government and his family shady business schemes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  We know now because of our investigation that he sent dozens and dozens of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  emails in a pseudonym to many of these business associates. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=118.36s)]
*  They won't turn those emails over, as you know, Jason. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=122.7s)]
*  That's part of the evidence we're continuing to seek to receive through [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  this impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=130.1s)]
*  And we know that he communicated with every single person that he said he [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=131.4s)]
*  never met with that sent his family millions and millions of dollars around [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=135.28s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=138.44s)]
*  So the American people know something stinks here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's going to be a problem for Joe Biden moving forward. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=141.3s)]
*  Not only are his policies a disaster, but the American people think he's a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=144.44s)]
*  crook. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=148.68s)]
*  Tell me, go through the list, if you will, just off the top of your head of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=151.22s)]
*  documents and things that you're wanting to see that you haven't yet been able to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=154.56s)]
*  get your hands on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=158.96s)]
*  Well, first right now, I think one of the most important amount of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=161.66s)]
*  documentation that we need are those pseudonym emails. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=165.96s)]
*  Remember, no one knew about these pseudonym emails until a few months ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  We found that Joe Biden was using at least three fake names on government [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  emails. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  What we didn't know until recently was that he was in fact using those pseudonym [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=179.5s)]
*  emails to communicate with not just his son, Hunter Biden, but also with his shady [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=184.18s)]
*  business associates. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=190.58s)]
*  The Politico in their ever never ending defense of Joe Biden wrote a story when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=192.28s)]
*  the White House turned over 14 of these emails, which didn't even amount to half [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=198.38s)]
*  of 1% and said, oh, there's nothing here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=204.78s)]
*  These are junk emails. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=207.12s)]
*  But what we learned from the indictment in California, several of those emails [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=208.42s)]
*  that Joe Biden used a pseudonym were used as evidence against Hunter Biden in his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=213.12s)]
*  failure to pay taxes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=220.5s)]
*  So that is important evidence there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=221.84s)]
*  We also need those depositions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  There's certainly a reason that Hunter Biden's not wanting to come in and answer [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  questions. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=232.42s)]
*  We have his bank statements and bank records don't lie. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  So we want to depose Hunter Biden. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=236.72s)]
*  Obviously, we want to depose all of the business associates. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=239.66s)]
*  But we also need those pseudonym emails. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=242.6s)]
*  And we also have questions for the National Archives. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  Which countries were involved in the documents that Joe Biden mishandled? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=248.1s)]
*  That's something that I think is very important of our investigation because [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  we've identified, Jason, a couple of emails that Hunter sent to people in Ukraine, for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=255.48s)]
*  example, that we believe may have been classified documents that Joe Biden [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=261.98s)]
*  mishandled that were in possibly the garage of Joe Biden's house where his son [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=268.42s)]
*  was living. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=273.7s)]
*  And finally, Hunter Biden not showing up before the committee with the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=276.7s)]
*  duly issued subpoena. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=280.7s)]
*  How soon do you think the House would actually move to hold him in contempt? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  I hope it's as soon as we get back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=287.94s)]
*  I mean, I think most of my colleagues will go home. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=289.58s)]
*  They'll spend time with their family. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=293.62s)]
*  They'll go to ball games. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=295.12s)]
*  They'll hopefully go to the grocery store. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=296.32s)]
*  They'll hear from their constituents. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=298.38s)]
*  And the constituents want to know what's going on here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=299.86s)]
*  They want to know is our president for sale? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=302.56s)]
*  Has our president been conspiring with our enemies around the world for millions [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=305.26s)]
*  of dollars that was sent to his family? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  This isn't normal behavior. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=313.5s)]
*  And the media can write no evidence, no evidence all day long. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=315.3s)]
*  That's not going to change the fact that there's a lot of evidence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=318.56s)]
*  There are a lot of questions here that this family has failed to answer. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  The media thinks that they can attack me or Jim Jordan, and it's going to discredit [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=326.14s)]
*  this investigation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=330.98s)]
*  But poll after poll shows a majority of Americans are keeping up with this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=332.18s)]
*  And they expect someone to investigate public corruption. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=335.68s)]
*  They know the FBI has failed to do their job. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=338.74s)]
*  They know the IRS has failed to do their job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  And they know that the Department of Justice has failed to do their job. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=342.98s)]
*  So the only entity that's left out there is the House Oversight Committee. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank God the Republicans won the majority, and we have subpoena power. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=351.62s)]
*  We're using that subpoena power in a disciplined and transparent manner [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=355.22s)]
*  to try to get the truth to the American people about whether or not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=360.24s)]
*  this president is compromised. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=363.54s)]
*  Chairman Comer, thanks for joining us on Hannity. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=367.2s)]
*  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz1YA5QsJh8&t=371.09999999999997s)]
