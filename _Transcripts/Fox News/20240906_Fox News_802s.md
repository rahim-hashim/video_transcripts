# Sean Hannity: Does Kamala Harris stand by this?
**Fox News:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs)
*  The one and only debate scheduled between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is on Tuesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=0.0s)]
*  It'll be in Philadelphia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=6.0s)]
*  David Muir, Lindsey Davis, they will moderate the debate for ABC. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=7.44s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this is a network that detests Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=11.28s)]
*  We have shown you that over and over again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=15.8s)]
*  It is the same network whose CEO, Bob Iger, Disney, calls a notorious ex-Clinton aide, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=18.12s)]
*  George Stephanopoulos, an unbiased journalist. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=25.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=29.32s)]
*  Well, Mr. Iger, and I say this respectfully, here's a reminder of your journalist, George [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=30.32s)]
*  Stephanopoulos, from his days as a devout Clinton Democratic staffer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=44.6s)]
*  What is names address? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=45.6s)]
*  I can send you a fax with names addresses, phone numbers of who you had an affair with. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=46.6s)]
*  It wouldn't make it true. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=50.6s)]
*  It is completely ****. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=52.24s)]
*  If you went on the radio and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=54.16s)]
*  black child, you would be laughed at. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  People would think you're crazy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  I guarantee you that if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=62.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=68.8s)]
*  That sounds kind of like a threat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=69.8s)]
*  Very same George Stephanopoulos, now touted as one of ABC's most trusted news anchors, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=71.92s)]
*  but in reality, like so many in the media, he is nothing more than a radical, left-wing, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=78.92s)]
*  Democratic talk show host. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=85.6s)]
*  So should we really hold out any hope that ABC will at least try and be fair? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=87.08s)]
*  Well, outgoing ABC, Disney CEO Bob Iger. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=92.48s)]
*  What kind of reputation do you want to leave behind? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=96.4s)]
*  Will your network, are you going to be fair? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Are you going to really show journalism? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=103.04s)]
*  Are you going to be neutral? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=104.8s)]
*  Or will the reputation of ABC News under the banner of Disney live up to their reputation [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=106.68s)]
*  of or forever be tarnished with extreme left-wing media bias? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=115.0s)]
*  I would assume, Bob Iger, that you want conservatives to patronize Disney theme parks and Disney [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  products. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=127.2s)]
*  And here's the problem we have. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=128.84s)]
*  Iger's heir apparent is apparently a huge Biden supporter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=130.32s)]
*  Again, keep in mind, approximately zero Trump supporters are currently employed by the channel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  So maybe with the exception of Reince Priebus, so let's make it easy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=140.12s)]
*  I want to help out ABC and give them a little bit of perspective and research. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  So here we are, Kamala Harris, nearly 50 days as the candidate, and she has changed dramatically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=150.6s)]
*  ever since becoming the presumptive nominee. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=157.44s)]
*  Let's start with something very basic, very simple. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=160.16s)]
*  The beloved plastic straw, which just changed her position in the last 24 hours. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=163.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  We need to understand that leaders have to lead. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Leaders have to lead. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=175.36s)]
*  Plastic straws are a big thing right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=176.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Do you ban plastic straws? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  I think we should. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=181.72s)]
*  Well, now Harris' campaign aide is telling Axios that Kamala no longer supports banning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=182.72s)]
*  your plastic straws. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=187.68s)]
*  But we have yet to hear directly from Kamala on the subject. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=189.8s)]
*  In fact, we haven't heard a word from Kamala about almost any of her flipping or flopping. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=192.84s)]
*  And the list is quite long. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=198.32s)]
*  Electric vehicle mandates, she's the one that supported him in 2019. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Banning fracking, she said it many times. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=205.68s)]
*  Banning offshore drilling, she said that many times. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  Supporting a mandatory gun buyback program, I think we'd call that confiscation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=211.16s)]
*  Does she still support that or not? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=216.8s)]
*  Decriminalizing illegal immigration and offering free housing and healthcare and education, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  legal driver's licenses in Minnesota from her running mate, as well as free college [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=224.68s)]
*  education. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=229.36s)]
*  You know, does she support the border wall? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=230.36s)]
*  She mocked Donald Trump for the border wall and said he thinks that a bunch of terrorists [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=232.66s)]
*  are going to be invading the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=236.96s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what has happened. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=238.6s)]
*  We now have unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants with known terror ties in the country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't know where they are and they won't tell us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=247.64s)]
*  Does she still want to eliminate ICE or not? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=250.16s)]
*  Does she still want reparations or not? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=252.96s)]
*  Does she still support defund, dismantle, no bail laws, reimagining the police or not? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  Does she still support the bill that she sponsored in the Senate? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=262.28s)]
*  Medicare for all, $93 trillion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=266.04s)]
*  Well, Medicare for all, that would be universal healthcare. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=269.04s)]
*  She sponsored the bill with Bernie Sanders and it would eliminate all private health [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=273.2s)]
*  insurance. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=278.36s)]
*  That is a basic question. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=279.52s)]
*  Will ABC ask it? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  The $93 trillion Green New Deal, that would eliminate capitalism as we know it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=283.44s)]
*  She co-sponsored that bill in the U.S. Senate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=289.26s)]
*  You know, federal job guarantees and federally guaranteed healthy food and healthcare and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=292.84s)]
*  daycare and childcare and pre-care and I mean, the list goes on and on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=298.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=304.48s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=305.48s)]
*  Assault weapons that are already in circulation, what do you do about those? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=307.8s)]
*  Well, there are approximately five million to your point, Craig. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=311.04s)]
*  We have to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  If someone crosses over the border, it's illegally, it is illegal and you would decriminalize [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=317.16s)]
*  it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=321.56s)]
*  I would not make it a crime punishable by jail. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=322.56s)]
*  It should be a civil enforcement issue but not a criminal enforcement issue. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=325.52s)]
*  His quest to build a vanity project called The Wall, this is irresponsible, it's a height [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=329.96s)]
*  of irresponsibility. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Should black people get reparations? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  I think there has to be some form of reparations and we can discuss what that is. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=342.14s)]
*  As President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=345.76s)]
*  New Deal. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=352.02s)]
*  The Medicare for All bill, I think initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders, you're [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=353.58s)]
*  also a co-sponsor on it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=357.08s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=358.58s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don't have [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=371.7s)]
*  approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=379.38s)]
*  says well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=383.2s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=387.12s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=388.26s)]
*  Anonymous campaign aides now say Kamala suddenly no longer believes any of that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=389.54s)]
*  Now we saw a very different story during Kamala's one and only interview of the election, a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=395.46s)]
*  whopping 16 minutes and 30 seconds, 29 to be exact, and she emphasized that her values [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=399.7s)]
*  have not changed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  And she said it over and over again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  So does Harris still want to abandon the filibuster to pass the $93 trillion Green New Deal? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=410.0s)]
*  Will she decriminalize illegal immigration and give free housing, health care, education [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=416.64s)]
*  and a path to citizenship amnesty or not? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=421.88s)]
*  Does she stand by her tweet supporting a bail fund for the rioters and insurrectionists [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=425.12s)]
*  in the summer of 2020 or not? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=431.72s)]
*  Does she stand by saying the rioters won't stop, shouldn't stop and we won't stop or [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=433.72s)]
*  not? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  Does she still support Medicare for all the elimination of all private health care or [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=440.44000000000005s)]
*  not? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=444.54s)]
*  Is she still proud of Bidenomics? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=445.54s)]
*  We call it Bidenomics and we're proud of it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=447.68s)]
*  She supported it or not? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=450.32000000000005s)]
*  Does she still support defund, reimagine ICE and the police or not? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  Does she still want Americans to have the courage to never say radical Islamic terrorism [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  or illegal alien again or not? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=462.08s)]
*  Does she still want to tax unrealized capital gains and give Americans the largest tax increase [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=464.96s)]
*  not only in American history but world history or not? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=472.48s)]
*  Does anyone believe she's changed her position on fracking or offshore drilling because she [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=476.88s)]
*  lied to CNN and even CNN fact checked it? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=481.9s)]
*  And here's a good indicator of her true beliefs of radicalism. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=485.82s)]
*  She just hired a far left preacher who openly preaches against individualism, AKA capitalism, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=489.92s)]
*  and even allegedly described America as a cult and a bloodthirsty imperial beast. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=496.8s)]
*  They just hired this person. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=502.64s)]
*  So her communist campaign aides, are they willing to lie and hide and go into the witness [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  protection program to win an election? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=509.72s)]
*  And will Bob Iger's ABC Disney allow them to get a pass next week? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=512.8s)]
*  What does Harris really believe? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=518.72s)]
*  What are her real policies? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=520.4s)]
*  You know, there is still nothing listed in terms of policy on her campaign website. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=522.4s)]
*  Her stump speeches are long winded, feel good platitudes about freedom and joy that are [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=528.36s)]
*  meaningless and attacks on Donald Trump delivered from a prompter. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=534.22s)]
*  The same words in every speech and a variety of fake accents depending on the crowd. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=539.0s)]
*  Kamala wants to be elected president, but she won't tell anybody what she really believes [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=544.8s)]
*  on anything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=549.88s)]
*  Is that really okay with the so-called journalists at Bob Iger, ABC Disney and their quote news [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  department? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=558.8s)]
*  Democracy dies in darkness, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=560.56s)]
*  Even fake news CNN is baffled by some of Kamala's nebulous positions. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=562.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  There's really no greater symbol of Trump's presidency than the wall and the way that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  Democrats were attacking him over the wall and his restrictive immigration policies. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=572.6s)]
*  So we looked in that ad and if you look at it, that exact area of wall is in Sassabeh, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=576.84s)]
*  or Sassebee, Arizona. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=582.64s)]
*  And that is a portion of wall that was actually built by Donald Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=584.48s)]
*  It was built in an area where there was not previous walls. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=587.88s)]
*  It was actually pretty controversial when they were building it at the time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  So just to see that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=595.84s)]
*  I think there are other... [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=596.84s)]
*  She's using his wall that he built to say, look at what I did. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=597.84s)]
*  By the way, at the DNC, I was there. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=600.84s)]
*  It wasn't liked by many, but I was there. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=602.96s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=605.84s)]
*  They had walls all over the place, preventing people from getting in. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=606.84s)]
*  And then you needed credentials, picture ID. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=610.2s)]
*  I had to show it four times to get to the studio where I needed a broadcast from. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=614.96s)]
*  So Kamala Harris is now taking credit for a border wall built by Donald Trump after trashing [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  and mocking that same border wall dozens of times, and now wants you all to believe she [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=626.48s)]
*  has always been in favor of a border wall. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=632.0400000000001s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=634.88s)]
*  So the question is ABC News Disney, are they truly going to bring up these fundamental, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=636.6s)]
*  basic questions that America needs to know? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=643.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris has played a massive role in the border crisis. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=648.08s)]
*  In fact, she played a major role in all of the Biden-Harris administrations. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=651.88s)]
*  They have many failures on the economy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  They're a failure in Afghanistan. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=660.04s)]
*  According to Kamala, she's always the last person in the room, you know, when these major [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=662.12s)]
*  policies and these decisions are being made, like 13 service members dying because of the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which was [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=673.36s)]
*  a massive, you know, actually a massive environmental spending bill and a bill that actually empowered [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  the IRS to go after service workers and their tips. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=685.6s)]
*  You know, that caused inflation to go up. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=689.24s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=691.52s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden this week saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=692.88s)]
*  You know, I'm proud to announce that my my investments that through my investments, the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=697.6s)]
*  most significant climate change law ever. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=704.0s)]
*  And by the way, it is a 369 billion dollar bill. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=707.24s)]
*  It's called the we should have named it what it was. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=711.08s)]
*  But but anyway, Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote in the Senate to pass this phony [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=714.96s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=721.92s)]
*  Make no mistake, she owns inflation and America's struggling economy and every crime committed [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=723.72s)]
*  by every illegal immigrant in this country. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=729.6s)]
*  Just last month, job growth fell short of expectations yet again. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=732.32s)]
*  Just over one hundred and forty thousand new jobs created. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=736.88s)]
*  By the way, more jobs over four point four million now created for illegal immigrants. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=739.76s)]
*  And get this, these jobs filled by farm-born workers, you know, in the country and Americans [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=746.04s)]
*  are losing jobs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=752.4799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, ABC Disney, they need to be very clear about one issue. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=753.92s)]
*  Prices are not coming down. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=759.52s)]
*  Inflation continues to rise. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=761.52s)]
*  Prices are up well over 20 percent under Biden and Harris. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=763.66s)]
*  Gas prices up well over a dollar a gallon. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=767.5s)]
*  No end in sight. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=770.74s)]
*  Americans are suffering every time they go to the grocery store, every time they fill [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=772.66s)]
*  up their gas tank, they pay their electric bill. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=776.1s)]
*  So is Kamala Harris. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=779.24s)]
*  You know, she says on day one, I'm going to deal with inflation and immigration. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=780.24s)]
*  Day one was January 20th, 2021, not 2025. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1ODnzalEs&t=783.84s)]
