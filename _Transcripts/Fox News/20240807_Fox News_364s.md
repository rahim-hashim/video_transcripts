# Gov. Ron DeSantis: Do Americans really want the ‘San Francisco experience’?
**Fox News:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs)
*  saying that in 2021, Minnesotans were five times more likely to move to Florida than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=0.0s)]
*  the other way around. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=6.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=7.38s)]
*  I know you probably have had little or no sleep the last week or so because of Hurricane [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=9.4s)]
*  Debbie. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=15.6s)]
*  How are things on the ground? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=16.6s)]
*  We're doing well, Sean. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=17.6s)]
*  It was a category one, as Florida standards go. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  That's about as minimal as we get. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=23.92s)]
*  So we are monitoring flooding situation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=27.84s)]
*  We're going to continue to provide relief. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=30.56s)]
*  That's just what we do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=32.96s)]
*  We're wired for this and everyone's doing a really good job. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=34.08s)]
*  But I'll tell you, seeing that news this morning, I was leaving the Emergency Operations Center [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  in Tallahassee and I think to myself, you have a vapid San Francisco Democrat leading [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=42.64s)]
*  the ticket. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=50.28s)]
*  And now they put in this guy, Waltz, who's basically an Ilhan Omar style, very leftist [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=51.64s)]
*  Democrat from Minnesota, has the most liberal record of any governor in the country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=57.88s)]
*  Is that what the American people want? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=62.64s)]
*  The San Francisco experience where homeless are defecating in public on the sidewalks, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=65.12s)]
*  the Minnesota experience where cities are burning down? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  And Governor Waltz was derelict in his duties to sit back and allow those cities to burn. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=74.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris was egging it on and she even raised money to bail people out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=80.68s)]
*  So yes, Harris-Waltz ticket is make America burn again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=86.12s)]
*  But I watched his speech, Sean, and this guy's a shyster. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's saying these things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=96.48s)]
*  He claims, oh, you know, leave your neighbors alone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=98.04s)]
*  It's none of your business. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  This is the guy that set up a snitch line during COVID for neighbors to inform if somebody [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  was violating his draconian COVID restrictions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=108.12s)]
*  He claims people should be able to make whatever health care decision they want. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=110.76s)]
*  Yet he as governor mandated the experimental COVID-19 jab. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=114.44s)]
*  And then he says Republicans are weird. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=119.0s)]
*  Yet this is the governor who put tampons in the boys' bathroom throughout Minnesota schools. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=121.76s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=128.72s)]
*  You know, there is the X nickname going around, Tampon Tim, make America burn again. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=132.06s)]
*  I don't know which one's going to win out, but one of those is probably right up there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=138.54s)]
*  Maybe we should have—we'll put up a poll on Hannity.com and get the right answer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=142.22s)]
*  But I will tell you, not only are they both radical and extreme, there's another component [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=146.22s)]
*  to this, Governor, is their economic policies, to me, are dangerous. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=151.34s)]
*  Their immigration policies are dangerous. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=155.1s)]
*  Their energy policies, to me, are dangerous. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=157.94s)]
*  Their policies on law and order and safety and security, they're dangerous. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, have the courage not to say illegal alien or have the courage not to say radical [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  Islamic terrorism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  That to me is dangerous. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=172.54s)]
*  And that's who they are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=174.7s)]
*  If there's anything surprising about today—and you tell me if I'm wrong—it's the fact [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=176.26s)]
*  that she chose a political, you know, a soulmate here of hers, somebody that just agreed with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  pretty much every radical position she has. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=189.02s)]
*  That surprised me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  And what does it say about the Democratic Party if there's no room for Josh Shapiro? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  Because, well, the pro-Hamas radical anti-Semites that Van Jones was talking about will get [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=196.5s)]
*  pissed off. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, they talked about her not picking Shapiro, and the question was, was [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  she bending a knee to the pro-Hamas caucus and her own party? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  And I don't think that's the case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=214.02s)]
*  I think she is part of the pro-Hamas caucus in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=215.38s)]
*  This is who she is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=220.34s)]
*  Governor Walz is in many ways a mirror image. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  And so she represents San Francisco leftism. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=226.38s)]
*  He represents that same philosophy, but he's actually done it in Minnesota. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=230.76s)]
*  That's why we've had so many people move to Florida. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=235.3s)]
*  I think since he's been governor, they rank in the top 10 states for population loss on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=237.82s)]
*  net. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=244.06s)]
*  And Florida is the number one state for population gain on net. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=245.78s)]
*  But here's the, I think, the issue that we Republicans have to face. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=248.74s)]
*  Everything you said is right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=252.06s)]
*  Everything I said is right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=253.3s)]
*  It is the most left-wing ticket in American history. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=254.46s)]
*  But we've seen how the media has treated this race since Joe got sidelined. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=257.66s)]
*  They are trying to turn Kamala into this cultural phenomenon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=262.3s)]
*  They are not going to report on his liberal positions, the fact that he gave drivers' [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=266.46s)]
*  license to illegals, the fact that he wanted to buy ladders so that people, illegal aliens, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=270.7s)]
*  could hop over the border wall and get into this country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  They're not going to talk about any of those radical positions. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=278.46s)]
*  They're going to dress him up as a moderate. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  They're going to say, oh, he's just a football coach, just a teacher, talks about being a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=282.82s)]
*  veteran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=286.98s)]
*  Sean, I'm an Iraq veteran. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=287.98s)]
*  They've talked more about him being a veteran in 24 hours than the mainstream media has [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=288.98s)]
*  ever mentioned that about me my entire time as governor. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  So that's what we're up against. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=295.88s)]
*  This is going to be a total con job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=297.52s)]
*  How do you counter that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=299.02s)]
*  On behalf of the corporate media. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=300.9s)]
*  You counter it by getting out there and speaking the truth. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=303.18s)]
*  You get it out there by going talking to your friends, going door-to-door, and you get it [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=306.5s)]
*  out, quite frankly, by paid media, us being able, with our groups on our side, talking [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=310.34s)]
*  about the truth. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  We have people like Tim Walz and Kamala Harris in their own words taking the most far-left [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  positions imaginable. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=323.29999999999995s)]
*  It's our responsibility to educate the American people on that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=325.18s)]
*  And if we do that, we'll win. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=328.74s)]
*  We have the Kamala files on Hannity.com. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=330.98s)]
*  Tomorrow we'll have up the Walz files and people can download it, share it with their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=333.46s)]
*  friends, their neighbors, their coworkers, strangers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=338.82s)]
*  I don't care who they share it with, but the media is not going to do it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=341.26s)]
*  That part, I think you're 100% right on. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=345.34s)]
*  I think JD Vance was right as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=347.3s)]
*  Governor, I know it's been a tough week for you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vp5PgbowUs&t=349.3s)]
