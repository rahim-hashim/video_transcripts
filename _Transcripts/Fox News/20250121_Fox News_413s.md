*  We can find something in common. We might think differently on how to get get certain things done [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=123.34s)]
*  But I keep reminding them every day I go [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=127.58000000000001s)]
*  There's some bad actors and want to take everything you have and lock you in a prison cell. We didn't get elected [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=129.58s)]

*  I've been saying it and I always had I pray to God that I'm wrong, but I don't I do wrong [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=156.94s)]
*  But you know you said something and I think this is an important point [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=163.9s)]
*  How do you reconcile those that want open borders with those of us that want vetting and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2NoDr4zg&t=168.14s)]
