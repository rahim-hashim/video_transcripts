# Rand Paul calls for 'emergency injunction' for SCOTUS to rule on Trump ballot ban
**Fox News:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE)
*  All right. Here with more reaction, author of The Best Seller Deception, The Great COVID Cover-Up, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=0.0s)]
*  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. And by the way, speaking of COVID, Fauci will be back on Capitol [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=4.32s)]
*  Hill next week. This is going to get interesting. Senator, great to have you back. Let's first get [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=9.92s)]
*  your reaction to the breaking news tonight. And to me, the Supreme Court had to take this case. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It is too critical. It is too important. And how ironic that a president and a party that claims [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=21.92s)]
*  a monopoly on the term democracy is everything but democratic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=28.64s)]
*  Without question, the Supreme Court has to hear it. When I hear that it's going to be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=36.08s)]
*  almost a month though until the hearing and perhaps longer to the ruling, I'm concerned [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=39.92s)]
*  that even that's too long. I think there needs to be an emergency injunction to shut down any of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  states that are wanting to do this and just say the decision will be in three or four weeks, but [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=49.6s)]
*  you can't be lining these up because they're frivolous, because they are so likely to lose [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=53.6s)]
*  on the merits that we're going to go ahead and shut them down with an injunction now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=58.72s)]
*  The reason for that is every day that it appears as if Donald Trump might not be on the ballot, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=62.0s)]
*  if that goes on for three or four weeks, that affects the minds of the voters as they prepare [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=67.76s)]
*  to vote. So the accusation, just the accusation alone makes people think, oh, well, maybe he's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=72.08s)]
*  guilty of something. You know, you think it wasn't planned that they use the words insurrection for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=76.8s)]
*  two years now. We had a riot where some people misbehave violently and some people should have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=81.44s)]
*  been punished on January 6th, but it was also a bunch of people milling around too. Probably 80% [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  of them milling around kind of curious walking. I know one young man who walked in, never said a word [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=91.36s)]
*  to anybody, was in the Capitol for a minute and a half and he gets taken, thrown down to the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=96.64s)]
*  Florida airport, arrested and accused of a crime. So we know that this was a ploy from the very [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=101.12s)]
*  beginning. Why didn't they call it a riot? Because they said we're going to use the 14th [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=106.88s)]
*  Amendment. We have this plan. We're going to call it an insurrection. But they've so overplayed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=110.32s)]
*  their hand here. This January 6th was not the Civil War and nobody believes that. And the more [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  video we've now seen of these, some of these people, the shaman walking around saying, hey, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=122.16s)]
*  can I go in that room? And people showing them around and then policemen saying, hey, please [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=126.8s)]
*  don't go in there. You're going to get in trouble. The more we see that this was not some sort of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=131.12s)]
*  violent riot for the most part, and it was not an insurrection, the more people say the Democrats [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=135.68s)]
*  are just crazy to think they can win an election on this and then they want to add to it that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=141.12s)]
*  we're not going to have Trump on the ballot. They're going to add that to it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=146.4s)]
*  You know, in 2020 in the summer, those mostly peaceful riots that took place, 574, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=149.84s)]
*  we had a couple of dozen dead Americans, thousands of injured cops. They were pelted with bricks, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=156.24s)]
*  rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, billions of property damage, a ton of evidence that nobody [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=161.44s)]
*  ever looked at. You could have arrested every person involved. Maybe you could call that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=167.04s)]
*  insurrection. But then you go to January 6th. Why didn't they want to talk to the Capitol Police [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=171.44s)]
*  Chief or follow up on even NBC News's report that there was actionable intelligence that they didn't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=177.44s)]
*  act on? Why is it that Muriel Bowser rejected in writing the use of the guard? Why didn't they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=185.04s)]
*  listen to the Capitol Police Chief? And why didn't they do something to prevent anything like this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  from ever happening again? We can't have another January 6th. But they were too, I guess, focused [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=198.48s)]
*  on just bludgeoning Trump and not looking for a solution to prevent it from ever happening again. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=206.32s)]
*  I think you need to, you need, you know everything you need to know once you know that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=210.8s)]
*  the footage that you saw January 6th played on other networks and by that House committee, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=217.36s)]
*  that joke of a committee, was done by a Hollywood producer. They went through thousands of hours and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=222.8s)]
*  they selected out the worst images, but they didn't show any sort of images that countered [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=228.24s)]
*  their narrative. So they set up this narrative and they began using the word. And I remember the first [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  time I heard the words insurrection thinking, well that's bizarre. Why would they be using the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=237.76s)]
*  words insurrection until the whole thing gets tied together neatly with the 14th Amendment? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=242.16s)]
*  It has to be an insurrection because those are the words in the 14th Amendment. But the laughable [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=247.2s)]
*  nature of comparing January 6th to the Civil War and also the demeaning nature, you know, we recently [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  had a candidate ask about the Civil War. Well, to compare a riot where there were no guns and no [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  loss of life from the rioters killing anybody to compare that to the Civil War where 600,000 people [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=264.32s)]
*  died to end slavery, at least half of them wanting to end slavery, that's just crazy to think that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=270.08s)]
*  that's somehow going to be equated, the Civil War and the riot of January 6th. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=277.12s)]
*  Rand Paul, Happy New Year. Thanks for being with us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  You can get it anywhere else. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EEYeNK9AE&t=294.32s)]
