# This agency could see a 65% reduction under Trump
**Fox News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A)
*  is the EPA administrator, our old friend, Lee Zeldin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=0.0s)]
*  Should have been governor Lee Zeldin, but more do I know. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=4.4s)]
*  Good to see you, congratulations, great to have you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Sean, great to be with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  So you're talking about a 65% reduction [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=13.4s)]
*  in the workforce at the EPA, tell us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, 2024 at EPA, there were tens of billions of dollars [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=22.06s)]
*  spent in 2025, we want that number reduced [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=26.52s)]
*  by tens of billions of dollars. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=30.2s)]
*  I don't want Congress to be giving us [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=32.44s)]
*  the tens of billions of extra dollars. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=34.64s)]
*  We saw all this money going out to left-wing advocacy groups. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=37.24s)]
*  Not only are we not sending money out [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=41.0s)]
*  to left-wing advocacy groups, we don't wanna send money [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=42.64s)]
*  out to right-wing advocacy groups. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  We don't need the money, we need to operate [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=47.0s)]
*  more efficiently, that's with regards to grants. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=49.04s)]
*  We've worked with Doge, Elon and his team [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=51.78s)]
*  have been fantastic to work with. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  I've canceled about 30 grants working with them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=55.8s)]
*  with $120 million of savings. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=58.0s)]
*  I canceled a $50 million grant [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=60.44s)]
*  for the Climate Justice Alliance. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  They say that climate justice runs through Gaza, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  runs through a free Palestine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=66.6s)]
*  And there's been a lot of developments [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=68.84s)]
*  with regards to this scheme to dump the gold bars [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=71.48s)]
*  off the Titanic, buy it in EPA, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=75.68s)]
*  political appointees words not mine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=77.92s)]
*  And every time we uncover a new rock [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=80.28s)]
*  with regards to that funding, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=82.36s)]
*  we keep finding new concerning things. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=84.96s)]
*  We've been working with the Justice Department, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=87.0s)]
*  they're all over it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=88.82s)]
*  And the fact that they park tens of billions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=90.32s)]
*  at this bank is crazy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  We wanna reduce the real estate footprint. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=93.52s)]
*  And we also have a lot of personnel [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=96.0s)]
*  who have now decided to exit the agency, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  others who have been terminated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=100.72s)]
*  We need to operate as efficiently as possible. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=102.44s)]
*  We wanna make the American public proud, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  wanna make you proud and ensure [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=106.78s)]
*  that we are fulfilling our mission [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=108.94s)]
*  while also delivering on that Trump mandate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about how much of the EPA [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=113.48s)]
*  has gotten caught up in environmental radicalism [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=117.4s)]
*  and how much of the money from the EPA [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=121.48s)]
*  is being spent abroad? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=124.04s)]
*  Well, a lot, I mean, when we talk about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars that went out in 2024, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=131.44s)]
*  a lot of it was going out towards, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=134.56s)]
*  with self-dealing in mind, conflicts of interest, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=137.56s)]
*  going out to entities that weren't prepared [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  to receive it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=142.46s)]
*  One example, a Stacey Abrams-linked NGO [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=143.34s)]
*  that just formed in 2023 and only received $100, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=146.74s)]
*  got $2 billion from the Biden EPA. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=150.78s)]
*  If they put in a grant agreement [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  that they had 90 days to complete a training called [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=156.08s)]
*  How to Develop a Budget. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  If they don't know how to develop a budget, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=160.86s)]
*  they shouldn't be given a dollar, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  let alone being given $2 billion. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=163.9s)]
*  So a lot of the funding has been going [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=166.84s)]
*  to these left-wing activist groups. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  They'll use a term like environmental justice. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=171.06s)]
*  They'll say that some community has been left behind [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=173.66s)]
*  and that we need to deal with an important issue [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  to deliver clean air, land, and water. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=178.82s)]
*  Okay, that makes sense, but here's the thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  In the name of climate justice, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=183.76s)]
*  instead of sending that dollar [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=185.98s)]
*  to remediate the environmental issue, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=187.54s)]
*  they're sending the money to their friends on the outside. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=189.78s)]
*  We're not gonna play along with that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=193.62s)]
*  As you said earlier in the show, no more business as usual. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=194.78s)]
*  I got it, the fact that you can cut two thirds [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=198.54s)]
*  of the staffing at the EPA speaks volumes, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=201.1s)]
*  and then maybe they can actually focus on the real issues [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=205.7s)]
*  involving environment, not radical leftism. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, Secretary Zeldin, Lee Zeldin. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp6RfenVC1A&t=213.06s)]
