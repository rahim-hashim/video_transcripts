# This is what’s MISSING from Hunter’s latest indictment: Judge Jeanine
**Fox News:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ)
*  Now, here with more co-host of the hit show, The Five, our great friend, Judge Jeanine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Pirro, the one and only. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=5.82s)]
*  Judge, put on your legal hat for a minute here, and let's look at Joe Biden himself [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=7.76s)]
*  in all of this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=14.36s)]
*  And the amount of money, if it wasn't for Joe Biden, none of this money would be coming [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=16.04s)]
*  in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=20.96s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=21.96s)]
*  How does this get back to him? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=22.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, the amazing—we have to understand that this is an indictment by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=24.36s)]
*  the same guy who tried to pull the wool over everybody's eyes and literally take this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=30.28s)]
*  case for a plea negotiation into a court where a judge said, hey, wait a minute, has the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=36.64s)]
*  Department of Justice ever done this before? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=42.28s)]
*  And they had to reach back and say, no, we've never done it before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=45.0s)]
*  They were trying to hide tax charges in a plea agreement involving a gun for which Hunter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  at that point wasn't even charged. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=53.5s)]
*  So if you think there's anything on this straight and narrow, the f-ing-up about this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=55.58s)]
*  indictment, you're wrong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=59.14s)]
*  The only thing about this indictment, it's nothing more than what we've heard about. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=60.46s)]
*  We already knew that he was someone who was involved with hookers and whores and all kinds [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  of human trafficking and all kinds of money spent on exotic cars, hotels and rental properties. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=70.82s)]
*  But this new indictment doesn't say much more than what we already knew. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  What's missing, and no surprise since they tried to get away with a plea deal of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=81.5s)]
*  century, says nothing about his being a foreign agent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  It says nothing about human trafficking, nothing about money laundering. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  And Joe Biden is involved in this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=94.78s)]
*  And I'll tell you how. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=96.82s)]
*  Hunter Biden is profiting off of his father's name. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=98.42s)]
*  We know from Bobulinski, Devin Archer, that there were meetings at that Cafe Marmont or [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=102.58s)]
*  whatever it is in Los Angeles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  We know that there are 327 emails where Joe Biden is using a pseudonym directly in contact [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  with Eric Schwirwin because they're talking about business. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  And we've got emails that are occurring exactly at the time when the Ukrainian deal is going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=122.28s)]
*  down and Joe Biden goes over there and says, if you don't get rid of the prosecutor on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=128.32s)]
*  this company my son's on, you're not getting a billion dollars in American money. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=133.88s)]
*  That is corruption per se. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFg1NGbMGWQ&t=138.6s)]
