# Stephen Miller: Americans should kick Democrats out of DC for supporting this
**Fox News:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4)
*  All right, the House passed the SAVE Act today, which requires proof of citizenship when registering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=0.0s)]
*  to vote. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=8.32s)]
*  Now, this common-sense, Republican-backed bill put forward by Chip Roy of Texas was, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=9.32s)]
*  of course, fiercely opposed from Democratic leadership, who urged their House members [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  to vote against the bill, and all but five, in fact, voted against it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Now, prior to the vote, Donald Trump voiced his support for the bill. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  So, the question now is, did almost every Democrat today vote to protect the possibility [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=28.0s)]
*  that Joe Biden's unvetted, illegal immigrants, what, have a chance to vote in our elections? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=33.88s)]
*  You know, a lot of times you get a license, which can happen in many states. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=40.16s)]
*  Next thing after you get your license, would you like to register to vote? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=44.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=48.2s)]
*  They don't ask for any identification. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=49.2s)]
*  Proof of citizenship. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Here with reaction is Harris Poll Chairman Mark Penn, along with former senior White [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=52.919999999999995s)]
*  House aide to President Trump, Stephen Miller. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  Stephen, we'll start with you tonight, because Mark's going to have a very tough night. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  This is really one of the most astounding days in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=68.12s)]
*  They called a simple question before the House. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=75.68s)]
*  Should illegal aliens vote in our elections? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  That was the bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=84.04s)]
*  The Republican bill was, you must prove you are a citizen to vote. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=85.42s)]
*  Period. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Virtually every House Democrat voted against the bill and said, we want illegal aliens [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=93.28s)]
*  to be able to vote just by checking a box. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=99.48s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=102.04s)]
*  You get the form. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=103.04s)]
*  Are you a citizen? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=104.12s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=105.12s)]
*  If you check yes, there is no validation, no verification, no identification or proof [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=106.12s)]
*  of citizenship that is required. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=111.72s)]
*  This should be a pox on the entire Democrat Party. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  The Democrat Party has just declared they support illegal aliens voting and every American, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  whether they're liberal, conservative, independent, wherever they fit in that matrix, they should [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  kick the Democrats out of Washington for having the temerity to support illegal alien [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=130.64s)]
*  voting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=135.76s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mark, look, why would any Democrat be against the requirement of proof [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=136.76s)]
*  of citizenship? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=142.92s)]
*  Why are so many Democrats against voter ID? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=144.55999999999997s)]
*  Why are they against other integrity measures, signature verification, updated voter rolls, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=147.92s)]
*  partisan observers watching the voting in every precinct all day, the vote counting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  all night? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Why would they be against this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=159.72s)]
*  Can you explain why so many in your party are? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=161.24s)]
*  Well, look, I can offer a less nefarious reason, I think, that Democrats voted against this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=164.4s)]
*  bill. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  There are about 160 million people with passports. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Generally, lower income voters have more trouble either having a passport or getting documentation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=180.24s)]
*  So I do think that Democrats think that it would knock more of its real citizen voters [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  off the rolls, and so I think they have a rationale. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=192.48s)]
*  When it comes to voter ID and things like that, I think there's less of a rationale. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=195.04s)]
*  There are states where you don't need proof of citizenship to get a license. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=200.12s)]
*  Once you get the license, you can register to vote. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=204.44s)]
*  You never have to require proof of citizenship. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=206.84s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden allowed in nearly 11 million unvetted, illegal immigrants from 180 countries, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=210.0s)]
*  some of our top geopolitical foes, some with countries with ties to terror. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=217.56s)]
*  And we're opening the door in the possibility, and then there's no voter ID or signature [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=222.2s)]
*  verification. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=228.72s)]
*  Tell me how that lends itself to confidence in elections and integrity in our voting. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=230.72s)]
*  How? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=237.96s)]
*  Well, I think if we went to a system of universal ID, you know, along with Social Security numbers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  when they're issued... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=246.96s)]
*  You want my fingerprints too? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=247.96s)]
*  ...that there would be a secure citizenship. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=248.96s)]
*  You want a chip in me? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=249.96s)]
*  Well, you see, you don't... [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=250.96s)]
*  Sean, you don't want universal ID, but you do want people to have these documents, and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=251.96s)]
*  a lot of lower income voters don't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=256.64s)]
*  I want proof of citizenship, Mark. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=257.64s)]
*  I mean, I think there's some truth to both sides. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=258.64s)]
*  A proof of citizenship is not a heavy burden, Stephen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=263.44s)]
*  No, Mark is just wrong on the facts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=267.96s)]
*  The U.S. government knows who is a citizen and who is not. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=270.96s)]
*  If you enroll in a federal welfare program, the government has a database to see if you're [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=274.96s)]
*  a citizen or not. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=280.24s)]
*  They know through Social Security. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=281.34s)]
*  They know through the Real ID Act. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=282.84s)]
*  There's a dozen different ways the government can validate if you're a citizen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a conscious choice to let illegal aliens vote. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=292.84s)]
*  Simple voter integrity issues results in confidence in election results. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=293.84s)]
*  That's fair for both sides. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Simple, basic common sense. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=302.08s)]
*  All right, thank you both. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxLjmMtuW4&t=304.15999999999997s)]
