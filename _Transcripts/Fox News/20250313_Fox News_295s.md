# Newt Gingrich: Dems are ‘enraged’ and have ‘no solutions'
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU)
*  Alright, here with Reaction Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=0.0s)]
*  if you're nice to me, I'll let you drive my new Tesla. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=3.88s)]
*  Ha ha. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=6.72s)]
*  Alright, I'm with her. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=8.08s)]
*  I think a cyber truck would really have been you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=10.52s)]
*  You could have put Sean on the side of it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=14.48s)]
*  Oh, is that what I should put? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=16.6s)]
*  So that, what, then I become the target. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=18.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=20.54s)]
*  I just like fast cars. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=21.54s)]
*  What can I tell you? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=23.48s)]
*  But alright, so you see all of this happening. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=26.04s)]
*  You have discussed that they're the party of crazy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=29.58s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries says, well, we got the Republicans on the run. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=32.66s)]
*  I'll get into this in more detail. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  Republicans on the run, did we see them on the run last Tuesday night? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=38.62s)]
*  What did you see Tuesday night? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=41.72s)]
*  Well, I think that everything you showed earlier reflects what Lincoln said at Gettysburg when [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=43.78s)]
*  he said this is a test of whether this system or any system so conceived in liberty can [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  survive. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=58.58s)]
*  You have a hardline group who believe that they have the right to be violent, that they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=59.68s)]
*  have the right to deny the American people the choice of their leadership, that they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=64.58s)]
*  have the right to break the law. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  The answer to all of that is, frankly, you have to lock them up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=71.86s)]
*  You have to enforce the law, period. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=74.92s)]
*  And at some point people begin to realize that you can't wage war against the entire [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=77.46s)]
*  American people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=82.82s)]
*  And in that sense, I would argue that Elon Musk is simply one of the people serving the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=84.82s)]
*  American people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=90.77999999999999s)]
*  He's a senior adviser to the president of the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=91.77999999999999s)]
*  And I think that in that sense, all of this is totally unacceptable, as is harassing a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=95.86s)]
*  Supreme Court justice or harassing the vice president and his three-year-old. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=101.3s)]
*  What I saw the other night, as you know, Clifton and I were there when the president spoke [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=106.46s)]
*  to the Congress, we were actually sitting directly above the House Democrats. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  And I wrote at Gingrich 360 a newsletter describing them, saying that the House Democrats were [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=115.54s)]
*  sort of zombie Democrats. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  They couldn't applaud anything. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=123.34s)]
*  They couldn't applaud the president. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=124.34s)]
*  They couldn't applaud a 13-year-old cancer survivor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=126.28s)]
*  They couldn't applaud a young man who wanted to go to West Point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  They couldn't applaud people who were there who had lost loved ones. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=132.34s)]
*  It was pretty bizarre. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  And I think that, you know, Hakeem Jeffries may think, look, he has to say these things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=138.9s)]
*  He's their leader. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=143.3s)]
*  What's he going to say? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=144.3s)]
*  But the fact is, the Democrats currently have no solutions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  They are so enraged that Trump is actually changing what overwhelmingly Americans believe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=150.36s)]
*  is a corrupt system. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=156.74s)]
*  And I'll just give you one piece of data. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=157.74s)]
*  Our America's New Majority Project just had a poll come out yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=160.22000000000003s)]
*  82 percent of the American people believe the system is corrupt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=164.62s)]
*  Now, that's dangerous both for the survival of freedom, but also it tells you the Democrats [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=169.82s)]
*  who want to defend the bureaucracy and the corruption and the waste, they're going [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=175.94s)]
*  to have a big mountain to climb come 2026. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=181.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to have a big mountain to climb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=184.34s)]
*  Do you think, you know, holding up their bingo paddles and not standing for moms that lost [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=187.66s)]
*  their children or a 12-year-old young man that lost, you know, that won his battle with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=194.58s)]
*  cancer and became a Secret Service agent and all the other people that were honored, the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=199.78s)]
*  American people see that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=204.9s)]
*  How do they react to that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=206.1s)]
*  Because that is soulless. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=207.38s)]
*  You have to—I can't imagine, if you have a heart, mind, conscience and soul, you'd [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=209.5s)]
*  ever act that way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=214.82s)]
*  And not one of them stood. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  Nobody clapped. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=217.62s)]
*  They just listened to their leadership. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=218.74s)]
*  You were in the room. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  Look, I had the opposite experience. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  I was the Speaker of the House sitting behind Bill Clinton when he got up in 96 and said, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  the era of big government is over. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=230.9s)]
*  Now, I had to stand up and applaud. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=232.78s)]
*  I mean, how can you not applaud that if you're a conservative? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=238.18s)]
*  And so in all the years I went, whether it was Reagan, Carter, George H.W., Clinton, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=239.18s)]
*  in all the time I went, I don't remember Republicans ever failing to stand for the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  president because we're standing for the office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  We're not standing for the individual. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=255.22s)]
*  We're standing for the elected official of the American people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=256.9s)]
*  And I think to not do that begins to show an alienation that's very dangerous. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=269.02s)]
*  I went to one with Barack Obama and yes I stood and yes I clapped for the office. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  And I got a lot of people staring at me at that speech. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=277.3s)]
*  I'm not sure why. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=280.1s)]
*  It didn't look very friendly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=281.1s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=283.42s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHlOt7TfbU&t=284.42s)]
