# Kayleigh McEnany torches CNN's 'shameful' Trump coverage
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w)
*  All right, here now with reaction outnumbered co-host Kayleigh McEnany and former Arkansas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=0.0s)]
*  governor Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=4.24s)]
*  Kayleigh, let's get your thoughts on last night and the media mob, the biggest campaign [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=5.36s)]
*  contributors to all things Joe Biden and all things Democratic Party. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=10.56s)]
*  Will it be effective? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=15.6s)]
*  You know, time will tell. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=19.04s)]
*  I think not, though, and here's why. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=20.48s)]
*  Donald Trump last night, he did not just make history. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=22.6s)]
*  All he needed to do, that was a 12.8% margin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=25.68s)]
*  He crushed history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=28.52s)]
*  I mean, he beat his nearest competitor by 30 points, winning, as you point out, 98 out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=29.68s)]
*  of 99 counties losing by one vote the one county, just one singular vote. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=34.12s)]
*  It was by all accounts historic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=39.72s)]
*  Now, the media, for their part, they don't learn their lesson. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=41.8s)]
*  I mean, Sean, it's like 2016 on repeat where the number one issues immigration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=45.24s)]
*  We saw that last night where the media just doesn't deride Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=49.92s)]
*  They deride his supporters. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=54.16s)]
*  You remember that the Neanderthal thinking line from Biden recently back in 2016, you [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=56.64s)]
*  had Hillary Clinton basket of deplorables. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=61.96s)]
*  You had Don Lemon on his show laughing at the rubes who can't find countries on a map. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=64.16s)]
*  They haven't learned their lesson. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=69.0s)]
*  They continue to demean his supporters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=70.36s)]
*  But why I say it remains to be seen is this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=72.56s)]
*  I am worried that the media has a plan and we saw it play out last night to just censor [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  this man, Jake Tapper. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=80.6s)]
*  What a shameful moment from a so-called journalist, as you exposed him, he is not, to cut off [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump and say, you can hear him under my voice saying anti-immigrant things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  He was not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=94.2s)]
*  Let the people hear the man speak. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=95.2s)]
*  The leader of the Republican Party. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=97.44s)]
*  That's journalism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=98.92s)]
*  That to him is a fact. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=99.92s)]
*  He thinks he's a journalist. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=101.8s)]
*  You know what he is? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=103.32s)]
*  He's a talk show host. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=104.32s)]
*  I'm a talk show host. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=105.32s)]
*  I practice journalism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  That's part of my job. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=108.64s)]
*  I do investigative reporting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=109.64s)]
*  I give opinion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=111.92s)]
*  We talk about culture and sports. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=113.72s)]
*  I'm like an entire newspaper. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=115.44s)]
*  But they say they're journalists. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=116.88s)]
*  That's the distinction. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=118.36s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, let's get your reaction. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=120.36s)]
*  You're somebody that won the Iowa caucus. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=121.92s)]
*  Nobody's ever won by a margin anywhere near this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=124.92s)]
*  The closest Bob Dole in 88 with 13 percent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=128.08s)]
*  Trump wins by 30. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=131.12s)]
*  How do you analyze that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=132.32s)]
*  What you do is you just stand back and just live in the awe of the moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=135.16s)]
*  It was an incredible victory for Donald Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=139.68s)]
*  And it exceeded all the things that the press thought could happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=141.96s)]
*  It was a tough night for Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=145.92s)]
*  He put all of his effort, all of his money in Iowa, believing that he could win there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=147.68s)]
*  Or it certainly come very close. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=152.72s)]
*  He didn't either. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=155.16s)]
*  It's going to be a tough battle for him ahead, but tough for Nikki Haley. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=156.48s)]
*  Here's the thing that I couldn't help. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=160.4s)]
*  When you were playing those clips and these people were just pulling their hair out because [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=162.2s)]
*  Donald Trump had won and they wanted to make sure nobody could hear. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=166.64s)]
*  I'm glad I had a moment to compose myself because I was laughing so hard thinking, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  what a bunch of idiots. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And I was thinking about that great theologian, Ron White, who says, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=176.44s)]
*  you can't fix stupid. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  And I'm thinking the one reason that this only helps Donald Trump is because so many [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=182.48s)]
*  of us look at this and say, what are they afraid of? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=187.76s)]
*  If they thought Donald Trump was really crazy or they thought he was dangerous, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  they'd want him to speak. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=195.4s)]
*  They'd let him speak. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=196.88s)]
*  But they couldn't let him speak because he gave one of the best, most sensitive, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  thoughtful, gracious speeches in victory that I've ever heard a politician do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=204.0s)]
*  They didn't want America to hear that because a whole lot of Americans would have said, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=209.6s)]
*  I'll vote for that guy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  I like what he says and the way he says it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=214.88s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=218.6s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=219.27999999999997s)]
*  They can't run on Joe's record. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=220.04s)]
*  It's going to be democracy in peril. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=221.56s)]
*  It's going to be Donald Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be J6, J6, J6. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=226.04s)]
*  It's going to be demonizing abortion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=228.92s)]
*  And then Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist, and have every phobia ever known [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=231.04s)]
*  to man, whether it's accurate or not. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=236.16s)]
*  Great analysis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=239.08s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=239.88s)]
*  Kayleigh, good to see you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=241.0s)]
*  Thank you as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQhLSG8h62w&t=241.96s)]
