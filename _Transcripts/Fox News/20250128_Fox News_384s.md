# DeSantis responds after GOP lawmakers scrap his special session
**Fox News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw)
*  All right, here with more is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, my governor here in the free [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=0.0s)]
*  state of Florida. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=4.88s)]
*  Governor, I looked at what you put forward and your proposal to help the president with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=6.28s)]
*  law enforcement compliance, criminal penalties for illegal entry, a state immigration enforcement [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=13.3s)]
*  officer, unauthorized alien transport program, gang enforcement program, educational and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=20.6s)]
*  voting reforms. Am I reading this right in my state of Florida, where you're my governor, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=27.98s)]
*  that you have to fight a Republican legislator to pass those common sense measures? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=35.34s)]
*  Can you imagine? I mean, I got reelected by a record margin running on strong on immigration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=42.06s)]
*  Donald Trump won a historic landslide, a big win in Florida, running on the strongest immigration [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=47.58s)]
*  platform in the history of the United States. All these legislators ran bashing Biden for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=53.7s)]
*  four years. So now we have a chance. The president gets sworn into office. He's doing what he [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=60.14s)]
*  said he's going to do. He's issuing these executive orders. So we have a special session [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=65.9s)]
*  of the legislature to say Florida is going to be in this fight. We can be a force multiplier. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=70.78s)]
*  And here's the thing, Sean, the home in these guys are doing great. They don't have enough [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  resources. When you talk about all the people that have come in, you've got to have local and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=80.62s)]
*  state supplementing the federal government. We're the ones that are interacting with illegals. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=85.34s)]
*  You know, traffic stops. If you have gang members at some apartment complex, local cops should get [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=91.06s)]
*  them and then alert ICE. We've got to work together. So that's what we're trying to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=96.78s)]
*  But you know, there's swampy politics everywhere. And so some of the legislative leaders, they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=101.26s)]
*  foisted a different bill on the legislature today that guts all of the things you just said. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=106.38s)]
*  It guts that and actually takes power away from me as governor and gives it to the Commissioner of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  Agriculture, which agriculture is not exactly known for immigration enforcement because right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=118.3s)]
*  yeah, it's ridiculous and it's unconstitutional. I've got highway patrol working with Trump's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=124.62s)]
*  administration now. I've got National Guard. I am totally happy to do all I can. This actually [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=129.82s)]
*  takes the power away that I'm currently exercising now. So we've got to be strong. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=135.58s)]
*  We got to be strong as possible. We've got to get this right once and for all. This is a historic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=140.94s)]
*  moment. Do you agree with me? And I've been saying it for a long time now, and I've spent a lot of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=145.82s)]
*  time on this program scrolling the names of people, names most Americans never heard of, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=152.86s)]
*  people that were murdered, people that were raped, including known children, young children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=158.06s)]
*  We have known terrorists in the country, cartel members in the country. We have gang members in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  the country. That means they're also in the state of Florida. As I asked Tom Holman, I have to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  imagine and assume that a known terrorist is plotting an attack on the homeland. I would [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=175.5s)]
*  imagine that our state of Florida is a target. Donald Trump spends a lot of time down here. Am I [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=181.02s)]
*  wrong? Look, Sean, I don't have any specific intelligence, but you cannot possibly have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=186.78s)]
*  four years of a wide open border and not have those types of people seek refuge in this country [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=194.78s)]
*  and then plot. So absolutely, I think that there are terror cells throughout the country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=201.74s)]
*  I know that there are cartel cells. Donald Trump did the absolutely right thing by designating [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=206.54s)]
*  the cartels to be foreign terrorist organizations. And I think you're going to see some conflict [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=211.18s)]
*  there, which is probably a long time coming. But all of these things, I think, just underscore the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=216.46s)]
*  urgency of what the Trump administration is trying to do. We've got to get these people out of our [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=223.02s)]
*  country. The state of Florida wants to be there. We want to work hand in hand at the city level, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=228.78s)]
*  at the county level, and at the state level to help get the job done. Now, Donald Trump backed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=234.38s)]
*  your call for a special session. He said, thank you, Ron. Hopefully other governors will follow. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  What powers do you have as the governor in the free state of Florida to bypass a legislature that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=246.78s)]
*  clearly does not understand how important this is, that this is the biggest national security [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=253.9s)]
*  threat we're currently facing? Well, I can do some of the things I'm doing. Florida State Guard, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  National Guard, I have Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and we're already [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=266.3s)]
*  integrated. We're working with the Trump administration, Biden's people didn't want [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  to work with us at all. So that's been a breath of fresh air, but that's just scratching the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=273.9s)]
*  surface. What we need to do is we need the strong enforcement legislation to say, we all have duties [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=278.38s)]
*  at every level of government in Florida to cooperate and to work constructively with the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=285.02s)]
*  Trump administration. Now, we don't have sanctuary cities. We ban those under my governorship. We're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=290.06s)]
*  not a sanctuary state, but there's a difference between not sabotaging and actively assisting, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=295.17999999999995s)]
*  and we can be the force multiplier. So I'm going to do whatever I can do. I'm already doing that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=301.58s)]
*  Sean, I was the first governor to send people to the border to help Texas back in 2021. We started [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=306.3s)]
*  the transport program, which ended up the Martha's Vineyard Mission was the most famous one of those. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=312.46s)]
*  We have been in this fight for a long time, but I'll tell you what Donald Trump's allowing to do, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  he's willing to deputize our state and local officials to exercise immigration authority. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  So if people show up on the shores of Jupiter from Haiti illegally, I can have local and state [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=328.94s)]
*  people just send them back to Haiti immediately. We would never have been allowed to do that under [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=334.7s)]
*  Biden. So the president's trying to empower us and we need to take him up on that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=339.74s)]
*  What you and Governor Abbott did was the greatest political jiu-jitsu move ever, I think, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=345.5s)]
*  in the history of politics. That was great. The Martha's Vineyard one does stand out as a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  particularly good moment. They didn't even stay at Martha's Vineyard for a complete 24-hour period [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=354.78s)]
*  and we checked and there was enough room for all of them. Oh, yeah, we'll send them everywhere, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  but don't send them in my backyard. Anyway, Governor, appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqPIzmoAvw&t=367.9s)]
