# Dems' smear campaign got 'creamed' by Hegseth: Waltz
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM)
*  The good news tonight, they did not lay a glove on Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=0.0s)]
*  He should and absolutely will be confirmed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=5.46s)]
*  He has a lot of very critical work to get done, not that they talked about that today, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=8.44s)]
*  on top of falling behind on military technology. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=13.48s)]
*  Our military recruitment numbers are in the dumps. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=16.94s)]
*  Pete will help in a major way there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=19.48s)]
*  DEI has weakened morale, and it has hurt our military preparedness and readiness. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=21.52s)]
*  China eclipsing our production. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=27.84s)]
*  What we call what Reagan inherited, Donald Trump is inheriting, a huge gap of vulnerability [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=31.04s)]
*  in our defense capabilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=35.84s)]
*  Our adversaries are more emboldened than ever. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=38.0s)]
*  Why do China and Russia have hypersonic missile technology that is maneuverable and we don't? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=41.08s)]
*  What other systems are we behind on? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=47.2s)]
*  We better catch up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=49.76s)]
*  Democrats didn't want to talk about any of that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=51.6s)]
*  They're not bringing a single new idea to the table. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=54.96s)]
*  Our military was not a top priority for them today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=58.12s)]
*  Their only goal was to smear Pete Hegseth and not ask him about his vision for the Department [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=61.6s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=67.88s)]
*  Sadly, just buckle up, expect this for every single Trump nominee, and expect them to fail [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=68.88s)]
*  every single time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=75.08s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, he's the right man for the job, should be confirmed as quickly as possible. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=76.84s)]
*  We're here with reaction incoming national security adviser. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=82.24s)]
*  He gave a great strong endorsement and introduction to Pete today, Congressman Mike Walz. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=84.96s)]
*  You know, it's, we had a private conversation recently. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=90.32s)]
*  We've been friends a long time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=95.08s)]
*  And in that private conversation, we spent maybe 15, 20 minutes on the phone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=97.64s)]
*  We were talking together. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=103.12s)]
*  We talked more about the threats that this country is facing and the challenges that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=105.04s)]
*  President Trump is facing, the gap of vulnerability, hypersonic technology, the next generation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=112.12s)]
*  of warfare, more than they did in an entire day today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=118.0s)]
*  I mean, it was such a colossal waste of time to me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=122.0s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=125.36s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're absolutely right, especially on the waste of time when there were just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=126.36s)]
*  such huge issues before the Defense Department and before the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=133.8s)]
*  And I pointed out, you know, they've been having hearing after hearing in that very [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=138.72s)]
*  room, the Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  We do the same in the House Armed Services Committee on the poor state of our barracks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=144.24s)]
*  for our soldiers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=149.36s)]
*  Should we privatize them? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Should the military keep running those things as government run our health care issues for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  the military? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  How to incorporate AI? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=161.3s)]
*  Why is software so bad? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned shipbuilding. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  China is passing 400 ships. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=166.28s)]
*  The U.S. Navy is cruising towards half that number over the next five years and on and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  And those are tough questions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  They're not easy answers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=179.6s)]
*  Instead of asking about his vision, they just went for the smear. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=181.6s)]
*  But let me tell you the good news. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  What you couldn't see on the cameras was the room full of warriors that had stacked [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=187.24s)]
*  that room and were standing outside, standing room only, there to support Pete because they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=193.2s)]
*  know he's a leader. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=198.28s)]
*  They know he's one of us. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=199.6s)]
*  And he is a junior officer that was on the front lines, not in the headquarters, of these [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=201.48s)]
*  wars on terror, of these wars in the Middle East. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=206.44s)]
*  And we were all out there as the policy just drifted in how we got decades and decades [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=209.76s)]
*  of war that devastated the country financially and a whole generation of Americans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  He wants, he is going to lead. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  They want him to lead. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=226.2s)]
*  And it's the support of the troops that you could see in Pete's heart. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=227.2s)]
*  You could see the authenticity that I think really came out today in a hugely positive [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  way and just creamed the Democrats' smear campaign. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=236.98s)]
*  OK, so I support Elon Musk and Doge and Vivek Ramaswamy and their vision to cut $2 trillion [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=241.64s)]
*  in spending. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=247.88s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=248.88s)]
*  I also know we need to save Social Security and Medicare from insolvency. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=249.88s)]
*  I also know that we have to find known terrorists, rapists, murderers, cartel members, gang members, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=254.2s)]
*  and we have to deport all of them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=261.56s)]
*  I know that we have to end this gap of vulnerability and prepare for the next generation of warfare. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  That's all going to cost money. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=268.68s)]
*  To me, the biggest source of revenue is going to be energy dominance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=270.44s)]
*  That is the only outlet we have. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=275.64s)]
*  And we do have nearly $40 trillion in debt that we're going to have to pay back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=277.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=284.64s)]
*  Well, everything that you just laid out, President Trump has a vision to address. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=285.84s)]
*  Number one, this is why our allies have to step up. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=293.0s)]
*  Canada, who pledged to get to the bare minimum of 2 percent 10 years ago, and Trudeau has [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=297.3s)]
*  a plan to get there 10 years from now, he's pointed out that's unacceptable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=303.86s)]
*  Half of our NATO allies are unacceptable. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=309.1s)]
*  I just met with the Japanese, and they are going to meet their 2 percent minimum. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=311.14000000000004s)]
*  But this is why our allies have to shoulder their fair share, number one. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=315.38s)]
*  Number two, the Pentagon has got to spend more efficiently. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  From one hearing, Sean, I held up a bag of bolts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=325.68s)]
*  It's $90,000 for it to be DOD-certified. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  There are a couple hundred bucks in a hardware store. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  If you look at the business people that are going to be under Pete, that are going to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=336.68s)]
*  help him implement, that President Trump and his team are putting in place, they are going [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=341.24s)]
*  to drive efficiency, along with Doge. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=347.24s)]
*  And then I think we just need wholesale reforms on how technology is introduced into our military. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=350.9s)]
*  It's okay to iterate, to innovate and to fail. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=358.5s)]
*  We don't need four or five big defense contractors trying to reinvent the wheel on a 10-year [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  timeline. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  All right, Mike Walsh, you'll be at work in just a few days, and it can't be soon [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  enough. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=374.82s)]
*  We're so glad you got the position. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=375.82s)]
*  We'll be in touch with you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=376.82s)]
*  And Pete knows all these things. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=377.82s)]
*  We're going to get him confirmed, Sean, and we're going to do big things for President [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=379.18s)]
*  Trump and this country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=383.26s)]
*  I've had these conversations with him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=384.26s)]
*  I've had more substantive conversations with Pete, like Seth, on issues that we discussed [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=386.26s)]
*  than happened in that room today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a waste of time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEKP8dladuM&t=393.86s)]
