# Sean Hannity: No one is above the law... unless you are a Democrat
**Fox News:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM)
*  Hi, welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, as your mentally vacant president shuffles through the halls of the White House [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=3.4s)]
*  in his maximum-stability sneakers, lawyers and bureaucrats in the Democratic Party, they're [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=8.1s)]
*  hard at work. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=13.84s)]
*  You see, they're determined to get Donald Trump by any means necessary and are using [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=14.84s)]
*  America's system of justice as a political weapon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=21.12s)]
*  Now, this is as, well, Oliver Stone says, the new warfare, which is called lawfare. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=24.759999999999998s)]
*  In Atlanta, where the bogus case against Trump is now in limbo, well, disgraced Fulton County [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=31.8s)]
*  DA Fonny Willis just appeared on conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Rachel Maddow's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=37.04s)]
*  show on MSDNC. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  To blast Trump supporters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  And Congressman Jim Jordan, I'm sure that Fonny Willis has no political bias or ulterior [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  motives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=53.2s)]
*  He just wants justice to be served, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=54.24s)]
*  OK, Chairman Jordan, he will respond tonight straight ahead. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Florida, where the Biden DOJ is waging its own lawfare war campaign down [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  there against Trump, a shocking new revelation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Pay close attention to this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=68.92s)]
*  We now have unsealed court documents that Biden's politicized attorney general, Merrick Garland, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden's weaponized DOJ actually authorized, get this, the use of deadly force during that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=77.64s)]
*  August 22, 2022 raid at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=85.52s)]
*  Quote, law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=89.0s)]
*  against the former president of our country over a document debate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=96.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=102.6s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=103.6s)]
*  The left, they're going to rightly claim, this is well boilerplate language and standard [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  operating procedure typically used in federal searches. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  This was no typical federal search. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  This was a raid of the private home of a former U.S. president where he lives full time with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=117.2s)]
*  his son and his wife, the former first lady of the United States, over a document dispute. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  And while Trump was away during the raid, Secret Service, they were still on location. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=130.4s)]
*  And so were many other individuals connected to the former president. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=135.36s)]
*  So why was Merrick Garland prepping for a possible, what, shootout? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=139.16s)]
*  Why did agents roll up guns at the ready? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=144.78s)]
*  This was not business as usual. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=148.18s)]
*  This is a raid at Mar-a-Lago authorized by Joe Biden's DOJ against Joe Biden's chief [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=150.16s)]
*  political rival over a document dispute. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=155.8s)]
*  Keep in mind, Joe Biden's DOJ charged Trump with the same document-related felonies that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Biden was accused of committing for decades by the DOJ inspector general, but he was never [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  charged with any crime. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=170.48s)]
*  It's like Hillary Clinton, 33,000, deleted email, top secret, classified information [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=171.84s)]
*  on her servers, more than Donald Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=177.32s)]
*  But of course, no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute, we were told. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=181.56s)]
*  And by the way, Biden also never faced a federal raid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=185.32s)]
*  He had top secret classified documents, four separate locations spread out all over the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=188.32s)]
*  place. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=192.6s)]
*  Dr. Jill Biden, well, she never had federal agents rifling through her clothes and underwear. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=193.6s)]
*  No one ever showed up at any of Biden's houses, guns drawn for a surprise search and seizure. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=199.56s)]
*  This is not equal application of our law. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=207.68s)]
*  It's not equal justice under the law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=209.84s)]
*  It is what we've been warning you about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=212.1s)]
*  It's the weaponization of justice in America. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=213.8s)]
*  Here is the sense of proportionality. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=217.08s)]
*  We got lectured all the time when Bill Clinton was being impeached. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=219.32s)]
*  What about proportionality? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=223.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=225.08s)]
*  For a former president, documents dispute? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=226.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=228.64s)]
*  Deadly force, OK? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=229.64s)]
*  You don't think that maybe that should have been considered, especially since they allowed—Donald [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=231.4s)]
*  Trump had already allowed the FBI into Mar-a-Lago willingly, allowed the FBI into the very room [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=238.08s)]
*  where the, quote, documents were found. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=244.56s)]
*  As a matter of fact, they could have taken him with them that day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  They chose not to. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  They called back days later. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=250.82s)]
*  They said, can you put an extra padlock on that one room? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=252.16s)]
*  They complied with the request of the FBI. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=255.04s)]
*  All they had to do is say, can we come over? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=257.88s)]
*  And they would have been let in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=260.26s)]
*  Joe wasn't charged, according to Robert Hur, you might remember, because he would likely [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=261.68s)]
*  come off as a very, very nice but very forgetful old man who was asked, by the way—he was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=265.84s)]
*  asking if he was still vice president. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  Was I still vice president in 2009? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  That's the year he became vice president. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, we did reach out to Merrick Garland's DOJ. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=280.4s)]
*  We've yet to hear back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=285.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, the FBI told us that the authorization for the use of deadly force was standard—a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=286.84s)]
*  standard policy statement. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=292.0s)]
*  I told you they'd say that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=293.32s)]
*  Rightfully so. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  That is used for all search warrants, even a U.S. president over a document dispute. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=296.44s)]
*  That's not overkill? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=302.2s)]
*  OK, remember, no one's above the law, right, unless you're a Democrat. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=303.2s)]
*  Now, this brings us to another egregious lawfare campaign against Donald Trump, the one going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=307.28s)]
*  on in New York City. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  And today, the defense rested in its case, but not before Judge Juan Mirchon did his [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=313.88s)]
*  very best to hamstring all of their arguments from the very beginning of this trial. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=319.12s)]
*  And I said from day one, Donald Trump can't get a fair trial in New York, and he's not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=323.76s)]
*  gotten a fair trial in New York. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden, donor judge Mirchon, has been against Donald Trump from day one. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=330.68s)]
*  Now he sees what has happened in his courtroom, and now he's trying to save Bragg's absurd [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=336.0s)]
*  case that has fallen apart against Trump and try and get it over the finish line. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  And of course, you know, the only real crime detailed during the case involved not Donald [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=346.3s)]
*  Trump, but Michael Cohen, their star witness, stealing tens of thousands of dollars from [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  the Trump Organization. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=357.24s)]
*  They all knew about it, and they never arrested him, anyway, or charged him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=358.8s)]
*  As someone on CNN put it, while Trump was supposedly committing a nebulous Class E felony, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=363.6s)]
*  he was the victim of a much more serious Class C felony that the prosecution never bothered [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=368.72s)]
*  to charge. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Instead, they chose to employ a novel legal theory with an unexplained campaign finance [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  violation in order to upcharge a misdemeanor, pass their statute of limitations into a felony. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=380.64s)]
*  And Judge Mirchon was more than happy to lend a helping hand. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=387.96s)]
*  In fact, Mirchon even blocked testimony from a former M.V.C. chairman that knows the law, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=390.84s)]
*  you know, who the defense planned to use to clarify the federal election law. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=396.96s)]
*  Another biased, disgraceful example of nothing but a Biden donor prejudiced judge. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=401.36s)]
*  He also spared the — with no defense, by the way, literally, and got into a fight, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=407.8s)]
*  basically, with Robert Costello, who has impeccable credentials. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=414.8s)]
*  The judge sustained one motion after another from the prosecution. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=418.88s)]
*  Of course, that limited Costello's damning testimony that he knew was coming, because [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=422.8s)]
*  he gave it to Congress the week prior against Cohn, and after doing the exact opposite for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=426.92s)]
*  testimony from the shady witnesses called by the prosecution. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  And after Costello reacted with a sigh and an eye roll, or saying, geez, Mirchon lost [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=436.64s)]
*  his Adam Schiff, exploded, throwing everybody out of the courtroom, admonishing Costello, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=443.72s)]
*  don't roll your eyes, are you staring me down? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=449.44000000000005s)]
*  The judge screaming just days after doing nothing while porn star Stormy Daniels acted [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  out, let's see, a sex scene from the stand and described talking to dead people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  Make no mistake, Judge Mirchon is doing now everything he can do to save Alvin Bragg and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BOin-x8zkM&t=464.8s)]
