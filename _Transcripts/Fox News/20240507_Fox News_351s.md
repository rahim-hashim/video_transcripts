# Trump lawyer: This is the demise of our judicial system
**Fox News:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI)
*  Here with reaction, Trump, legal spokesperson, Alina Habba is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Alina, thank you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=4.96s)]
*  Glad you're here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=5.96s)]
*  Well, my understanding is, Stormi did not do well upon cross-examination. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=6.96s)]
*  Her personality changed dramatically. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Her demeanor changed dramatically. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=15.68s)]
*  She was very clear that she was coached by the prosecution in this case. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=18.54s)]
*  She admitted she hates Trump, wants him in jail, and then admitted that she didn't know [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  if she would pay the money that she owes Donald Trump with legal fees, and admitted to tweeting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  all these crude remarks about Donald Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=34.4s)]
*  And I'm just touching the surface here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=36.76s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=39.12s)]
*  You were in the courtroom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=40.12s)]
*  I was in the courtroom today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=42.96s)]
*  I was in the courtroom yesterday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=44.24s)]
*  What's more compelling to me is that the prosecution, whose case, frankly, in my opinion, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  has been destroyed, is completely discredited. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  And now they are saying, as of yesterday, that they want another two weeks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=55.56s)]
*  And that, to me, says it all, Sean, and the American people need to remember one thing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=58.52s)]
*  This case is not about defamation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=62.52s)]
*  It is not about a woman. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=65.16s)]
*  It is about a record-keeping category that was, frankly, correct, made in Trump Tower [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=66.76s)]
*  by the Trump Organization, somebody in accounting who did nothing wrong, who's never spoken [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=72.66s)]
*  to President Trump, while President Trump was doing what? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=77.86s)]
*  In the Oval Office running the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=80.6s)]
*  And that is what D.A. Alvin Bragg is trying to now put a former president on trial for. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=83.32s)]
*  It's not about the felony counts. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  It's not about what we heard today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=90.56s)]
*  That is a distraction. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=92.32s)]
*  It is about one thing, Sean, you know it and I know it, and that is to keep Donald Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=93.32s)]
*  out of the campaign trail, because Biden can't beat him, period, the end. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=97.96s)]
*  His poll numbers are amazing, and he's not even campaigning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=103.32s)]
*  So this is what they have to do, and then put an unconstitutional gag order so that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  on the days that he can campaign, he can't speak. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=111.2s)]
*  He can't defend himself. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=114.92s)]
*  What I have seen is absolute demise of American judicial system. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=116.76s)]
*  You said it perfectly in your monologue, Sean. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe what I've seen for the last two days in that courtroom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And now you've got a judge who will not grant a mistrial when they violated parameters that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=126.4s)]
*  he gave. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=131.16s)]
*  They did not care. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=132.72s)]
*  They went ahead and put salacious information that was, frankly, false. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=134.04s)]
*  We know that from words that were said prior to this trial, and now we're sitting here [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=138.48s)]
*  scratching our heads, wondering where taxpayer dollars are going, all so that President Biden [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  can win in November. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  That is all this is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  It was very clear to me today. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  As a matter of law, everything she talked about today was immaterial. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it had really nothing to do with the law. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Let me go back to the official statement that she says she was pressured to sign in January [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  of 2018 that I just read. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, was she pressured to deny the affair in 2006? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=169.92s)]
*  Was she similarly pressured to deny it in 2011? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  Was she pressured to deny it in 2016? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Was she pressured to deny it in 2017? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=180.76s)]
*  Because that's an awful lot of times that she was out there denying it and then admits [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=184.72s)]
*  she wanted to make money and sell a book. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=191.64s)]
*  And I'm not going to speak to her testimony. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=194.88s)]
*  She's currently under oath and we're going to continue cross-examining her on Thursday. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  What I will say is this, Sean, when you have inconsistencies with any witness, it speaks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=200.44s)]
*  volumes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=205.92s)]
*  When you pick people that are not credible, it speaks volumes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=206.92s)]
*  And I think that the fact that we have White House logs that DAs and AGs are all coordinating [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  and on the South Lawn with President Biden also speaks volumes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to hit each and every one of these cases like we have. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  As you saw with the boxes hoax today, this is disgusting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=223.44s)]
*  Jack Smith changing covers sloppy with evidence that he's now trying to blame President Trump [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=227.2s)]
*  when it was his hands in the cookie jar. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=233.64s)]
*  Let's be clear on what is happening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=236.52s)]
*  Their plan is falling apart. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=238.24s)]
*  It's going in their face. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=239.88s)]
*  And frankly, all of these cases should be dismissed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=240.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=243.16s)]
*  The special prosecutor has confessed to the court that they basically tampered with evidence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=244.16s)]
*  involving the documents case down there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=250.18s)]
*  Now this case is on hold indefinitely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=253.56s)]
*  Most voters are saying that Donald Trump is being denied a right to a fair trial in this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=256.88s)]
*  case that we're watching unfold before us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=261.08s)]
*  Now Congress will be investigating the special counsel in this case. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=263.76s)]
*  And the document case judge pulled the plug on the trial because of this admission that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=268.12s)]
*  they failed to preserve critical evidence. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=273.24s)]
*  And that footnote that we have been spending a lot of time on the last two days, is there [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=275.48s)]
*  any greater admission? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=280.8s)]
*  How does that case ever move forward at any time based on what we've learned? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=282.36s)]
*  Because when you're rushing cases, when you're bringing cases that are not true, when you're [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=288.56s)]
*  politically motivated, in time it will show. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=292.88s)]
*  I always tell the American people, sit tight and wait. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=295.16s)]
*  What we saw today was a story that I've heard for a decade that is complete garbage. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=298.16s)]
*  And finally, the facts are coming out and the cases are falling apart like a domino, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  one at a time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=306.76s)]
*  You've seen it in Georgia. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=308.24s)]
*  We're seeing it with Jack Smith. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=309.5s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=311.3s)]
*  And if the American people don't see that this is solely to take him off and out, silence [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=313.24s)]
*  him, censor him, censor his people, and make sure that he's sitting in a courtroom cold [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  and listening to this corruption, then we are completely misguided and blinded. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=323.82s)]
*  And we have to fix this country, Sean. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=329.12s)]
*  It is completely disgraceful what I am seeing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=331.06s)]
*  Well, if this continues, we're not a constitutional republic anymore. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=333.82s)]
*  Alina, thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQpamQhGnHI&t=338.1s)]
