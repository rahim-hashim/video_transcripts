# Eric Trump: Incompetence almost put my father in the grave
**Fox News:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40)
*  First, the other well-known Trump son from the Trump organization, Eric Trump, your big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=0.0s)]
*  night is tomorrow night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=4.68s)]
*  Tomorrow night, right before the president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=5.68s)]
*  I don't know, topping your wife might be hard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  She gave a great speech last night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=10.72s)]
*  She's the best. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  She's the best. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  She's a great mother. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  She's a great auditor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  She's elegant. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=16.12s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=17.12s)]
*  She's everything that the Republican party should be. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=18.12s)]
*  I'm her biggest cheerleader. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=19.68s)]
*  All right, so I have known both of you for a long time, and you don't know this, but [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=21.04s)]
*  they keep cutting away to you, and you're like a beaming, proud husband dad, you know, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=25.24s)]
*  standing there and smiling, happy for her. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=30.56s)]
*  Let's be honest, it's not easy, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=32.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, first of all, it's a big family. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=33.64s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=35.64s)]
*  It's not easy if your last name's Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=36.64s)]
*  You may want to consider changing it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=38.28s)]
*  By the way, 100%. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=39.92s)]
*  You do this every day, and you understand it, but getting on top of, you know, getting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=40.92s)]
*  on that stage in front of 15, 20,000 people in here, but tens and tens of millions of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  people around the country, it's not easy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=47.8s)]
*  But she went out there, and she did so with such great poise and grace and beauty, and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=50.0s)]
*  the message was beautiful. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=54.36s)]
*  I mean, coming into the Trump family, talking about a man that she got to know later on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=55.36s)]
*  in life, and it was, and how well he welcomed her into that family. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=58.44s)]
*  It was a beautiful speech, as it could be. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=62.6s)]
*  Well, I know, because I've seen it, and I've tried to watch him at times persuade your [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=63.76s)]
*  wife to do things, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=68.8s)]
*  Which is a lot of fun. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=72.64s)]
*  On a serious note, more and more details are emerging as it relates to this assassination [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=73.64s)]
*  And it is such a monumental failure that it's hard for me to comprehend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=79.32s)]
*  What many people may not know about you is you are a real marksman. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=85.6s)]
*  You are, you make your own guns. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  You manufacture them, you build them, you bore them, you do the whole thing, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I did a lot of competitive long-range rifle shooting, a lot of competitive shotgun [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=97.0s)]
*  shooting, a lot of pistol stuff, and it was just, you know, a world that I grew up in, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=100.8s)]
*  and I know that world as well as anybody. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  A shot at 130 yards with a precision rifle is a joke shot, and ask anybody who understands [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=105.68s)]
*  marksmanship, ask anybody who's serious into rifles, he should not be here today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=110.2s)]
*  And it was incompetence, and I do not blame the people on that stage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=115.4s)]
*  The people on that stage were incredible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=117.72s)]
*  They jumped on him, and they almost died because of the incompetence of whoever did the advance [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=119.24s)]
*  on the site, and whoever allowed a madman onto a roof at 130 yards with a rifle. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=123.68s)]
*  We almost changed democracy forever. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=129.58s)]
*  We almost changed the trajectory of this country forever. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=131.66s)]
*  We almost had a former president murdered, we almost had a future president murdered, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  and that was live streaming on every TV around the world. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  It was on Fox, it was on CNN, it was on every single network. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  America would have lost one of the most iconic political figures in its history, live streaming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  on TV based on the incompetence of somebody that allowed a madman on a roof with a rifle, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=151.34s)]
*  and it's not acceptable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=157.22s)]
*  And then you hear the Secret Service director come out and say, oh yes, the roof had a pitch [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  to it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=162.1s)]
*  The roof was like this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=163.1s)]
*  The roof was practically flat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=164.1s)]
*  It was nonsense. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=165.1s)]
*  The roof that the other snipers were on had more of a pitch on it than the roof. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=166.1s)]
*  I used to be in construction. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=169.94s)]
*  To do roofing, you got to stand on a roof. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=171.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's about a 3% pitch on that roof, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=173.34s)]
*  I mean, give me a break. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=175.38s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=176.38s)]
*  Then you have Joe Biden come out and say, yes, I spoke to the Secret Service director. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=177.38s)]
*  I spoke to him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=180.22s)]
*  The only problem is the Secret Service director isn't a him, it's a her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=181.22s)]
*  He didn't even know who the hell he spoke to. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=184.62s)]
*  It's an outrage. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=186.94s)]
*  And then they started trying to blame the local PD, and it's coming out now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=187.94s)]
*  The local PD was assigned to traffic patrol. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=191.82s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=193.98s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=195.06s)]
*  The reality is my children sat on my lap and almost saw their grandfather get executed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=196.18s)]
*  I sat there watching my father on the ground, bleeding from his ear, not knowing if he had [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=201.9s)]
*  taken shots to the head. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=205.78s)]
*  Obviously, I saw one that went to the head, thinking the worst, not knowing if he had [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=206.78s)]
*  taken shots to the chest, not knowing if the man was even alive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=210.1s)]
*  And then these are the lies they spoon feed you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Third, I know I'm on fire right now, but I don't trust the FBI to get to the bottom of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=216.9s)]
*  it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=221.42s)]
*  They've lied about the Russia hoax. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=222.42s)]
*  They lied about dirty dossiers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=223.42s)]
*  That was held over my head for a three-year period of time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=225.14s)]
*  They lied to a FISA court four times to spy on your father. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=227.61999999999998s)]
*  And no one in this country believes that they will conduct an honest investigation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=230.17999999999998s)]
*  And that breaks my heart to say because the men and women that carry the guns in that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=234.1s)]
*  organization are some of the greatest people that we have in this country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=238.26s)]
*  So I'm pissed off. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  It's incompetence that almost put him in the grave. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=243.14s)]
*  It's incompetence that almost changed our country in history. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  And this should never, ever happen again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=249.94s)]
*  She should resign as a disgrace. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=251.94s)]
*  And by the way, one last thing, I'll end with this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=253.74s)]
*  I wish to God the family would actually get a call saying, you know what, we know it was [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=256.56s)]
*  a big lapse in security and here are the 10 things we're going to do about it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=259.82s)]
*  As an executive, that's what I would do if I screwed the pooch on something that happened [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=263.26s)]
*  in my company. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=266.7s)]
*  But they don't have the fortitude to do that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=267.9s)]
*  It's going to be the blame game and they're not going to do a damn thing about this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=269.94s)]
*  All these families, your dad ran on immigration starting when he came down the escalator and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=273.22s)]
*  was attacked for it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=278.06s)]
*  All these people, a 12 year old girl raped and a 13 year old girl raped in broad daylight [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  in New York. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=284.42s)]
*  Joe Biden never called that family. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Didn't call the family of that 12 year old girl. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  Didn't call your family. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=290.74s)]
*  Didn't call the family of the mother of five. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=291.86s)]
*  He goes on stage, State of the Union. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=294.44s)]
*  It's not Lincoln Riley. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=296.42s)]
*  It's Lincoln Riley. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=297.76s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=298.76s)]
*  It's a her, not a him that's running the Secret Service. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=299.76s)]
*  What frustrates me is the more that we know is they had identified this guy as a real [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  threat, but why did they allow your father to take the stage? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=308.88s)]
*  Okay, let's say the pitch story on the roof is fine. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=312.0s)]
*  Why didn't they have sniper sights on that roof? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  Why would they have people in the side of the building and not surrounding the perimeter? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=318.88s)]
*  The guy took a ladder with a rifle and got on the roof. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  130 yards, hooray. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Way, Eric. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=328.52s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=329.52s)]
*  The problem is Americans' trusts are shattered because, okay, say a 500 yard shot with a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=330.52s)]
*  person who knows how to operate a rifle is not a very far shot, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=334.88s)]
*  I mean, that's still a chip shot. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=337.68s)]
*  If they're not covering a building at 130 yards, you think they're focused on building [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=339.84s)]
*  a 500 yards away? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=342.84s)]
*  The problem is it makes me lose faith in the entire perimeter of what's going on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=344.88s)]
*  And I love the agents on that stage. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  I know every one of their names. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=351.24s)]

*  They're trying to blame those guys. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=357.36s)]
*  Have you heard that? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  They will never, ever, ever get away with that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=360.56s)]
*  They will never. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=362.56s)]
*  Those people jumped on him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=363.68s)]
*  Those people had the counter snipers not fired back. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=366.08s)]
*  Those people all would have been full of bullet holes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=369.24s)]
*  Who was in charge of advance, though? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=371.52s)]
*  Because the head of the Secret Service, Kim Cheadle, admitted that they had identified [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=373.91999999999996s)]

*  But the pitch of the roof caused them to put the agents inside. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=381.32s)]
*  It was a flat out lie, John. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=384.64s)]
*  That is a flat out lie because the roof that the other snipers were on was steeper than [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=387.28s)]
*  this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=392.79999999999995s)]

*  Trust me, they're not going to have a problem walking up a roof like this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=406.24s)]
*  It's BS. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=409.8s)]

*  It's always lies. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  There's never accountability. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the problem with government. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  In private industry, somebody would get fired for this nonsense. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=417.24s)]
*  My father almost lost his head. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=419.68s)]

*  I don't care if this is a Republican. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=428.32s)]

*  I don't care if it's independent. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=430.8s)]
*  We have to protect our leaders of this country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=432.48s)]

*  We'll become the laughing stock of the world. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=441.8s)]
*  And last but not least, civil wars have been started in countries for less than this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=444.0s)]
*  We can't... [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=448.92s)]
*  Could you imagine what would happen in this country? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=449.92s)]
*  Could you imagine if anybody suspected that there was any funny business or even if there [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=452.12s)]

*  But I mean, Sean, what that could do to democracy? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=461.12s)]
*  Having... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=463.64s)]

*  You can't have it happen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=465.64s)]
*  Our elected leaders cannot be assassinated in the United States of America. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=467.0s)]
*  We have the ability to protect them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=469.36s)]
*  This is a monumental failure. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=471.44s)]
*  Let me turn to another topic. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=473.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  The full on effort to dump and destroy Joe Biden is in play. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, Chuckie Schumer, they're making phone calls. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=480.68s)]
*  They want him out big time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=484.36s)]
*  You see the pressure now. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=487.32s)]
*  They're trying to delay the nomination of Joe Biden, which was supposed to be done [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=488.32s)]
*  virtually. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  They're going to push it to July and to August and try and prevent him from getting that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  nomination. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=498.84s)]
*  You know, your father doesn't always know who he's running against tonight. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=499.84s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=503.96s)]
*  By the way, early voting starts in 62 days in Pennsylvania. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=504.96s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't know who he's going to run against. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=510.0s)]
*  And it could be Biden and you could have this kind of old man stubbornness or it could be [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=511.0s)]
*  somebody completely different. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=513.76s)]
*  You really have no idea. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=515.16s)]
*  What was most telling to me though that no one ever wants to talk about is the second [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=516.16s)]
*  that Biden came off the debate stage, universally every single nation, every single network [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=519.76s)]
*  started attacking him using the exact same lines. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=525.2s)]
*  It's almost like it was coordinated, which is... [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=527.84s)]
*  And he did a horrible job, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=529.88s)]
*  I mean, he was a total embarrassment. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=530.88s)]
*  But when he came off that stage, they started hitting him instantaneous. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=532.2s)]
*  Every single network that had laid cover for him for years and years and years in one instant [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  turned on him. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that wasn't coordinated, Sean. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm not a conspiracy guy, but you better believe that that was orchestrated in the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  background, this massive reversion from being kind of the puppet masters of Joe Biden to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  turning him overnight, thinking that they could create so much of a political pressure, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=556.0s)]
*  so much infighting and so much of a tide that he was forced to resign. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=560.4799999999999s)]
*  What's so sad to me is I've never been as concerned about the direction of our country. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=563.88s)]
*  I think we're at an inflection point or the direction of the world. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=568.2s)]
*  I believe this incident where your father was nearly assassinated and you have to explain [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  it to your children, you have to explain it to your younger brother, Barron. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=577.48s)]
*  I heard he had a hard time with this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=580.64s)]
*  Of course he would. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=583.2s)]
*  Of course your children would have a hard time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=584.2s)]
*  Of course you would have a hard time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=585.44s)]
*  Very understandable. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=587.72s)]
*  And then it's preventable. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=588.72s)]
*  11 million unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants that are the criminals that are amongst them, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=590.7199999999999s)]
*  those with terror ties that we have caught, coming from countries with terror ties, coming [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  from top geopolitical foes, all preventable. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  The Biden economy didn't have to be like this, Eric. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  Energy, we could be paying a lot less at the pump. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=607.52s)]
*  Inflation doesn't have to be this high. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  America's standing in the world, you know, can be reestablished. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VncisKky40&t=612.88s)]
