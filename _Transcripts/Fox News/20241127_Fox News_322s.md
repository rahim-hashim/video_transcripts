# Dr. Drew gives tips on handling political tension at Thanksgiving table
**Fox News:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=0.0s)]
*  With the 2024 election still on everybody's minds, things might feel a little bit more tense than usual at tomorrow's Thanksgiving get together. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=3.0s)]
*  You know, there's always that one at dinner. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=11.0s)]
*  One USA Today writer wrote, We can't share Thanksgiving. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=13.0s)]
*  You voted to deport people who look like me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=18.0s)]
*  And according to a CBS News poll, 71% of respondents said they would try to avoid talking politics at this Thanksgiving. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=22.0s)]
*  So how do we make it through Thanksgiving without losing our cool or our relationships? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=30.0s)]
*  Here now with reaction is the host of Ask Dr. Drew on Rumble. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=35.0s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=41.0s)]
*  All right, doctor, you always got that one in the mix, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=42.0s)]
*  They got the one. He's either they got the Trump derangement syndrome or maybe they just won't shut up about talking about politics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=46.0s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, happy Thanksgiving. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=54.0s)]
*  Everyone. First of all, that one article that says we should be avoiding politics at the Thanksgiving Day dinner. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=55.0s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=61.0s)]
*  But that one you're talking about with perhaps the Trump derangement syndrome has you use the word hysteria a few minutes ago describing the climate change movement, climate change hysteria. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=63.0s)]
*  You've also mentioned Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=75.0s)]
*  These are hysterias and hysterias. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=77.0s)]
*  Mass formations capture groups of people once in a while, and they've captured this country right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=81.0s)]
*  Our job is to deescalate it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=88.0s)]
*  You are not going to change anybody's mind at the Thanksgiving Day table. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=90.0s)]
*  We must not be any as Abraham Lincoln said, we must not be enemies, but friends. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=95.0s)]
*  We need not be enemies and remind people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=100.0s)]
*  It was Abraham Lincoln who created a day of Thanksgiving at the end of the Civil War. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=103.0s)]
*  That was the reason we got together as families on this particular day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=109.0s)]
*  And it warrants reminding people again of that historical fact. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=114.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of things to break it up, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=117.0s)]
*  There are things there's games, there's stories, there's family, there's football. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=122.0s)]
*  Fox has got some great games on football. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=125.0s)]
*  What other what other way do you deflect on this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=128.0s)]
*  What do you use as a technique to deflect? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=131.0s)]
*  So taking breaks for one thing, it's okay to go outside and take a walk. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=134.0s)]
*  But but also active listening. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=139.0s)]
*  Look, if all roads with hysteria, Lee, let's face it to narcissism. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=142.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=147.0s)]
*  So whenever you have somebody accusing you, you are what you should hear them saying is I am. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=148.0s)]
*  It's a projection. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=154.0s)]
*  So don't take the bait. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=156.0s)]
*  Don't let it trigger you and do something called active listening where you literally don't say anything [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=158.0s)]
*  you other than to say, am repeating back to them what you believe they're saying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=163.0s)]
*  I'm hearing you say it sounds like you feel just parrot it back to them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=168.0s)]
*  And particularly with hystericals and narcissists, you will be surprised how much that deescalates things. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=172.0s)]
*  Again, rational discourse, not going to work. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=179.0s)]
*  Containment, active listening, time out for yourself. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=182.0s)]
*  If you need to get away from it, don't take the bait. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=187.0s)]
*  That's the way to deal with it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=190.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=193.0s)]
*  The question for you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=194.0s)]
*  I happen to love cranberries and I like cranberries on pizza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=195.0s)]
*  Are you okay with that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=199.0s)]
*  Is that am I going to make it through Thanksgiving if I have a little side bit of pizza with cranberries on it? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=200.0s)]
*  So yes, I think some people know I did a program with Adam Corolla for many years and every Thanksgiving. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=206.0s)]
*  He regaled me with his hatred for the canned cranberry, which now I believe there are people who actually prefer that and seek that out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=212.0s)]
*  He would give recipes for the fresh cranberries every year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=220.0s)]
*  Right. But the one thing he will not tolerate, even if you make the cranberry sauce is fruit on a pizza. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=224.0s)]
*  So although I have no particular opinion about it, I was traumatized working with that man all those years about fruit on pizza. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=230.0s)]
*  So I'm having a little PTSD when you bring that up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=237.0s)]
*  Hey, I am all against the idea that you would put certain fruits like pineapples on pizza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=240.0s)]
*  I think that's so fundamentally wrong. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=247.0s)]
*  It's anti-American. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=249.0s)]
*  It just shouldn't happen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=250.0s)]
*  You know, cake can happen in Hawaii, but I'm totally against that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=251.0s)]
*  But the whole idea of cranberries on pizza, it's actually pretty good. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, I will not bring it up to my friend. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=260.0s)]
*  We literally had a conversation today about fruit on pizza where he was arguing, somebody told him that you couldn't even put fruit on half a pizza because it might bleed over to the other part of the pizza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=263.0s)]
*  So I will, on your behalf and in the name of clemency, you know, I mentioned that I was, I'm kind of a Lincoln of file and I bonded with kill meat on this very fact. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=274.0s)]
*  But the end of his first inaugural, we must swell the chorus of the union when again, touch base. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=285.0s)]
*  Surely we will be by the better angels of our nature. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=292.0s)]
*  I'm not sure he was thinking about cranberries. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=296.0s)]
*  So I was going to write those work, but it is good to allow us to focus on the better angels of our nature. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=298.0s)]
*  Dr. Drew, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnrz2T46Rs&t=306.0s)]
