# Sean Hannity: This has been a week of lying at the DNC
**Fox News:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg)
*  Welcome to Hanna. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Nine o'clock on the East Coast. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=2.0s)]
*  It is eight o'clock here in Chicago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=4.0s)]
*  Six o'clock on the West Coast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=6.0s)]
*  And we are in beautiful Chicago, Illinois. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=8.0s)]
*  So you don't have to be kidding. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=10.0s)]
*  But tonight we are entering an ultra creepy, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=12.0s)]
*  ultra sketchy phase of the DNC. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=14.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=16.0s)]
*  I want to say hi to all the girls in the audience here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=18.0s)]
*  In Chicago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=20.0s)]
*  How you doing? My name is Bill Clinton. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=22.0s)]
*  You all look so beautiful out there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=24.0s)]
*  Anyway, he's going to be up there. Tim Walz will be up there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=26.0s)]
*  Don't expect a lot of truth telling. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=28.0s)]
*  Let me tell you what has gone on most of the night tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=30.0s)]
*  They spent a ton of time talking about Project 25. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=34.0s)]
*  That's all you want to hear. All you hear. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=38.0s)]
*  Project 25, Project 25, Project 25. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=40.0s)]
*  There's a problem. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=42.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is not a part of Project 25. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=44.0s)]
*  Never has been. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=46.0s)]
*  It's a project he has said over and over again. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=48.0s)]
*  He doesn't know anything about it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=50.0s)]
*  He has no intention of enacting it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=52.0s)]
*  And the parts people have told him about it, he said flat out, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't agree with it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=56.0s)]
*  These are lies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=58.0s)]
*  And this has been a week of lying and distortion and propaganda, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=60.0s)]
*  misinformation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=62.0s)]
*  and smear, slander, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=64.0s)]
*  besmirchment of Donald Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=66.0s)]
*  And everything from abortion, immigration, the economy, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=68.0s)]
*  energy law, order, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=70.0s)]
*  a week of running away from their own words, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=72.0s)]
*  their own stated policies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=74.0s)]
*  One of the biggest tonight at the Democratic Nominees Convention, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=76.0s)]
*  Kamala's Convention, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=82.0s)]
*  they again spent an enormous, inordinate amount of time attacking Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=84.0s)]
*  You know, this is Kamala Harris. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=88.0s)]
*  And talk about January 6th. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=90.0s)]
*  Okay, rioting is wrong. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=92.0s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=94.0s)]
*  Said it that day on my radio show, that night on this TV show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=96.0s)]
*  Kamala, who tweeted out the Minnesota Bail Fund, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=98.0s)]
*  four days after a police, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=100.0s)]
*  oh, that's right, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=102.0s)]
*  you see the fire in the background, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=104.0s)]
*  those are mostly peaceful protests. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=106.0s)]
*  Right there, mostly peaceful. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=108.0s)]
*  So far, we're looking, monitoring what's going on here in Chicago. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=110.0s)]
*  But in 2020, remember that police precinct was burned to the ground. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=112.0s)]
*  Four days later, you know, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=114.0s)]
*  there's Kamala Harris, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=116.0s)]
*  saying take note, beware to Stephen Colbert. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=118.0s)]
*  These rioters won't stop. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=120.0s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=122.0s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=124.0s)]
*  The person said that these riots will continue. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=126.0s)]
*  Said she just dedicated a huge portion of the night [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=128.0s)]
*  lecturing this country tonight at her convention about rioting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=130.0s)]
*  The summer of 2020, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=132.0s)]
*  the president of the United States, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=134.0s)]
*  the president of the United States, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=136.0s)]
*  the president of the United States, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=138.0s)]
*  is here to talk about rioting. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=140.0s)]
*  The summer of 2020. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=142.0s)]
*  Let me remind you, 574 official riots, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=144.0s)]
*  dozens of dead Americans, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=146.0s)]
*  thousands of injured police officers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=148.0s)]
*  Remember, they were the ones [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=150.0s)]
*  pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=152.0s)]
*  Molotov cocktails. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=154.0s)]
*  There were billions and billions of dollars [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=156.0s)]
*  in property damage. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=158.0s)]
*  And then she chose a running mate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=160.0s)]
*  of all running mates, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=162.0s)]
*  the Bernie Sanders of governors, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=164.0s)]
*  who made excuses for all of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=166.0s)]
*  state of Minnesota. He's the guy that refused to call in the National Guard while Minneapolis [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=168.0s)]
*  was burning, whose family decided that rather than calling the Guard, they were going to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=173.96s)]
*  open the windows to the home that they were living in. They wanted to take in the smell [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=179.08s)]
*  of burning rubber from all the rioting. Now, needless to say, well, comrade Kamala's very [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=183.84s)]
*  weird far left running mate with a very strange affection for Communist China, who is masquerading [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=190.72s)]
*  as a moderate guy from the Midwest. He's anything but. Well, he has had a lot of trouble with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=196.88s)]
*  the truth and the media mob, complicit as always, biggest donors to the Harris Walls campaign. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=202.32s)]
*  Walls, let's see, he's been accused of lying about his rank in the National Guard, deployment [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  in a war zone in Iraq that he actually skipped out on, a drunk driving arrest where he pretended [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=215.28s)]
*  to have a disability. Walls even apparently lied about conceiving his children with the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  help of IVF. He's also accused of embellishing his time as a high school football coach, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=228.12s)]
*  when in reality he was a volunteer assistant coach who helped out with defense. He was [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=233.68s)]
*  never a head coach. Walls is the poster child, if you will, for the entire convention and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=239.24s)]
*  the Harris campaign, which has been fake and phony and fraudulent. It's sort of like con [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  artist, you know, Kamala or con artist, comrade Kamala. But the very beginning, for example, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=250.48s)]
*  here is a breakaway meeting at the DNC. I want you to pay very close attention. Now, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=257.44s)]
*  this was one speaker saying the quiet part out loud. This is all a lie. This is all manipulation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  This is all fake. This is all phony. It is all fraudulent. Their true intentions are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=273.68s)]
*  being hidden. Oh, like, let's see, eliminating or insisting and co-sponsoring Medicare for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=279.76s)]
*  all, eliminating private health insurance, universal health care. She co-sponsored it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=286.24s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders. The Green New Deal, she also co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders. But [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=292.6s)]
*  her campaign says she doesn't believe that anymore. But the real truth came out, not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=298.4s)]
*  on purpose. Take a look. We got 70 days to act right, y'all. That's right. That's some [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  days we can go back and crazy. Right? I tell people during quasi for seven days, we're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=310.56s)]
*  going to be conscious. Then we can go back to self-hatred. But for seven days, for 70 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=316.32s)]
*  days, I hope not. I hope not. But for those who got to just wait 70 days to go back, please [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=322.24s)]
*  be good. Just please be good for 70 days. Then we can go back to being crazy. That's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=330.72s)]
*  their plan in a nutshell. They just want to get to election day without highlighting any [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  of Kamala Harris's insane, frankly, communist policies, her real belief system, no fracking, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=342.16s)]
*  no drilling, higher taxes on everything. And of course, a radical foreign policy agenda on top of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=351.44s)]
*  all of that and defund, dismantle the police, no bail. And we got to defund ICE too. But if elected, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=358.48s)]
*  all bets are off. Medicare for all, Green New Deal, socialist price controls, taxes on pretty [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=365.28s)]
*  much everything through the roof. And the great irony of all of this is these radical measures [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=370.8s)]
*  would hurt lower and middle income Americans the most. They've even lied about the number of jobs [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=376.96s)]
*  that have been created by nearly a million, according to reports out today. That is a big lie. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  We created all these jobs. Well, they didn't. A lot of the jobs that they did create were, quote, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=389.52s)]
*  part-time. And they went to a lot of the illegal immigrants because of the unvetted illegals coming [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  from over 180 countries into our country, including people with terror ties, including [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=399.76s)]
*  coming from countries with terror ties, including coming from our top geopolitical foes. Now, of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=406.56s)]
*  course, the Democrats and their class warfare is nothing but a phony emotional appeal to help them [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  consolidate wealth and power. It's all about the power. For example, last night during her speech, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=416.96s)]
*  Michelle Obama, she said her parents, quote, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=422.64s)]
*  needed. The Obamas have an estimated net worth of 70 to 100 million dollars with four palatial [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=429.28s)]
*  estates, one here in Chicago, one in Hawaii, Martha's Vineyard, and Washington, D.C. By the way, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=436.55999999999995s)]
*  good for them. I believe in capitalism. But using class warfare in order to raise taxes and costs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  on all of you, the people that really do make the country great, hardworking Americans, get up, work [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=450.4s)]
*  hard, play by the rules, pay their taxes, obey the laws, that would be unethical and underhand it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=456.24s)]
*  But it's kind of like buying a beachfront mansion on Martha's Vineyard while shaming Americans for [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=462.72s)]
*  using plastic straws because of climate change and rising sea levels. By the way, number of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=468.64s)]
*  Democrats here, how many of them flew in on their beautiful private jets while lecturing you about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=474.56s)]
*  your caravan or your pickup truck? There's obviously an ulterior motive and a lot of hypocrisy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=479.52s)]
*  Now, of course, the deception doesn't end there. All week, the Obamas or the Democrats have called [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  for national unity and kindness and joy while launching nothing but nonstop personal attacks [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=491.52s)]
*  against Donald Trump and his supporters. And today, Donald Trump responded. Take a look. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=498.0s)]
*  Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night? Take little shots. He was taking shots at your [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  president. And so was Michelle. You know, they always say, sure, please stick to policy. Don't [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=509.04s)]
*  get personal. And yet they're getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=517.04s)]
*  to policy? Well, you might notice President Trump was speaking behind bulletproof glass. This was [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=522.72s)]
*  his first outdoor rally since getting shot by a would-be assassin. But you're not going to hear [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=529.12s)]
*  anything about that at the DNC. Democrats are doing absolutely nothing to bring down the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=534.48s)]
*  temperature. But that didn't stop Trump from coming out from behind the glass to check on [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=539.52s)]
*  a supporter who passed out because of the heat. Kamala, on the other hand, won't go five feet [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=544.8s)]
*  away from a teleprompter. Seems like she's not able to do it. She hasn't had a press conference, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  a gaggle, no interviews. Democratic elites are terrified that Americans will see the real Kamala [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=555.76s)]
*  Harris, that she will have to answer to her own words and her own beliefs and her own stated [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=562.56s)]
*  policies. They would also prefer that we not talk about her track record as Biden's VP. On day one, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=568.4s)]
*  I'm going to fix inflation. I'm going to get the prices of groceries down. What have you been doing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  for three and a half years except telling us inflation is transitory, the border is secure, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=581.68s)]
*  and everything is great. Today, as I pointed out, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they quietly [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=586.0s)]
*  released a revised jobs report showing that America created nearly a million fewer jobs in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=591.76s)]
*  March under Biden and Harris than originally reported. This was the largest downgrade in 15 [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=598.0s)]
*  years, although not the first. Numerous other glowing jobs reports under the Biden-Harris [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=605.92s)]
*  administration have also been quietly downgraded. And today, Biden's Commerce Secretary didn't seem [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=611.84s)]
*  to know anything about the downgrade and blamed Trump. When in doubt, always blame Trump. For the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=618.16s)]
*  border, blame Trump. For inflation, blame Trump. You know, for the dog bites, the bee stings, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=624.16s)]
*  if you're feeling sad, you can always blame Donald Trump. Take a look. Today, the Bureau of Labor [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  saying that more than 800,000 fewer jobs were actually created than initially reported. And [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=636.0s)]
*  we have a sound bite here just to play. We can listen to it together because Donald Trump is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  already addressing this on the campaign trail. Let's take a listen to that one together. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=645.12s)]
*  The administration paired the numbers with an extra, listen to this one, 818,000 jobs that don't [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=649.6s)]
*  exist. So when you hear that, do you potentially think that this new numbers could be a liability [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=659.36s)]
*  for this campaign? No, when I hear that, first of all, I don't believe it because I've never heard [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=664.32s)]
*  Donald Trump say anything truthful. It is though from the Bureau of Labor. I don't, I'm not familiar. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=669.12s)]
*  Why would you ever know those real numbers? Of course, blame Trump. Now, there was just one [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=675.2s)]
*  main qualification for employment at the Biden-Harris White House. If you hated Donald Trump, you're in. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=680.0s)]
*  For Democrats, nothing else seems to matter. That's been on display. This is night three of the same [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=685.84s)]
*  message. And so for the next four years, well, you can expect either elect a bunch of incompetent, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=691.12s)]
*  Trump-obsessed maniacs or an administration that will actually make your life better. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=697.28s)]
*  Ask yourself, are you better off than you are four years ago? And also what has Kamala done [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=703.04s)]
*  that is successful that would warrant a huge promotion? If Kamala has some big, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=708.88s)]
*  bold plans to improve the quality of life that she's been hiding for the last four years, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=714.48s)]
*  I think she should unveil them right here at this convention. Instead, the policy issues section of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=719.6s)]
*  her website, it doesn't exist. We'll have a lot more from inside the convention straight ahead. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=725.2s)]
*  Bill Clinton, how you doing? Good to see you. Welcome to Chicago. A lot of hot, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=731.2s)]
*  hot people out there in the crowd. I want to say hello to everybody. How you doing? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-qBRuHMBRg&t=735.6800000000001s)]
