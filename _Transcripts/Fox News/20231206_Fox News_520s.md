# Hannity: Hunter Biden implicated his own father
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw)
*  Another brazen lie from your president. Take a look [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=0.0s)]
*  There's polling by the Associated Press that shows that almost 70% of Americans including 40% of Democrats [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Believe that you acted either illegally or unethically in regards to your family's business interests. Can you explain to the Americans? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=10.48s)]
*  To Americans to admit this impeachment inquiry why you interacted with so many of your son and brothers foreign business associates [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=18.66s)]
*  I'm not gonna comment. I did not and it's just a bunch of lies [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=25.16s)]
*  There's a lot of decisions. I did not there's a lot [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=30.4s)]
*  Really no interaction with hunters business partners [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=35.12s)]
*  Well, that's what you're gonna go with Joe Biden is lying right to your face [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=38.16s)]
*  According to records just released from the House Ways and Means Committee Biden [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=42.64s)]
*  emailed with one of hunters main business partners and associates the so-called money man a guy by the name of Eric Sherwin a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=46.8s)]
*  whopping [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  257 times including 54 emails just between Joe and Eric Joe is vice president at the time [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=56.0s)]
*  Most of those emails occurred when Joe Biden again was serving all these communications were conducted with an alias [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=62.52s)]
*  Email account something you're not supposed to do in order to prevent future discovery and like a court of law [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=70.12s)]
*  According to the House Ways and Means Committee and Jason Smith [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=77.38s)]
*  Sherwin was the architect of the Biden family systems of shell corporations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=80.68s)]
*  They have identified dozens of them used to distribute foreign funds [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=86.04s)]
*  These were not real businesses as far as James Comer is concerned in 2018 that text message [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=90.68s)]
*  Remember hunter Biden allegedly crediting Sherwin for helping him pay his father's quote bills [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Quote my dad has been using most lines on this account [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Which through the gracious offerings of Eric Sherwin I have paid for the past 11 years in other words based on that text [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=107.04s)]
*  Hunter implicating his own father received foreign money from places like China and Russia and Romania and Ukraine [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  and Kazakhstan [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=122.28s)]
*  With the help of Eric Sherwin and then pops used the funds to pay his bills [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=124.18s)]
*  All while Joe and Eric emailed back and forth hundreds of times, but Eric Sherwin is just one of the many [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=129.32s)]
*  Hunter business partners that interacted with as Tony Bobolinski called him the big guy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=136.6s)]
*  Now this is a picture of Joe Biden who just said he'd never met with he said I never spoke with hunter his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=142.0s)]
*  My brother or anybody for that matter about their foreign business dealings. See that picture there. Yeah, that's hunters [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=148.4s)]
*  Kazakhstan business partners after a dinner at the ever so prestigious cafe Milano people from Harvard know that location [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=155.36s)]
*  Now here's another picture of Joe with hunters Mexican partners [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=163.76s)]
*  And here's a picture of Joe Biden golfing with hunters fellow barista board member Devin Archer [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=168.04s)]
*  Then vice president Biden even wrote Archer a letter quote. I hope I get to see you again soon with hunter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=173.44s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed the lunch. Thanks for coming PS. Happy you guys are together [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=180.18s)]
*  Archer testified that Joe Biden took dozens of calls with hunters foreign associates and business associates [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=185.0s)]
*  Quote Biden was put on the phone to bolster the brand the Biden brand and it wasn't hunter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  Archer then testified that barista executives [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=197.8s)]
*  That's the big oil and gas giant out of Ukraine that they demanded that hunter called DC to lobby against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=200.56s)]
*  Anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine and of course hunter obliged now Archer also detailed yet another dinner at the prestigious [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  Cafe Milano if you went to Harvard, you know all about it with hunters Russian backer [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=216.32s)]
*  This time the dinner was with the former first lady of Moscow her name [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=221.56s)]
*  Elena [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=225.76s)]
*  Batarina and the big guy Joe Biden himself and that's not all another Biden business associate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=226.76s)]
*  Tony Bobolinski says he met twice with Joe Biden ahead of an unusual business [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=232.48s)]
*  Partnership with our number one geopolitical foe right now, which is called China and in a 2017 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=238.2s)]
*  What's-at message you may recall hunter purportedly using his father to shake down his Chinese business associates [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=244.12s)]
*  Quote I am sitting here with my father and would like to understand why the commitment was has not been fulfilled [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person that he knows and my ability to hold the grudge [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=258.36s)]
*  That you will regret not following my direction. I am sitting here [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=265.08s)]
*  Waiting for the call with my father that would be Joe Biden [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=269.96s)]
*  Magically a few days later. Oh five million dollars was wired to a bank account associated with hunter hunter admitted [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  He had no experience in energy oil gas or coal in any way shape manner or form [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=281.42s)]
*  So he's dealing with the number one energy conglomerate in China and get millions and he's making millions out of Ukraine with barisma [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=286.4s)]
*  Now hunter Biden is now threatening to defy a house subpoena [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=293.96s)]
*  It is unclear if he will show up for his deposition or Joe's brother will show up in the case of hunter December 13th [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=297.22s)]
*  If hunter is a no-show Jordan and Comer they are planning to initiate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=303.92s)]
*  Contempt proceedings and the president's son could actually face real jail time as a designated [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=308.66s)]
*  Sacrificial lamb as we was reported last week [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=314.5s)]
*  It might be a risk that hunter is willing to take in order to save his father [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=317.18s)]
*  But let's be clear about three things one Joe Biden did in fact interact with hunters business [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  Associates and he did it over and over and over and over again too [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  According to hunter Joe Biden financially benefited from the foreign money distributed to his family the Biden brand [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=334.68s)]
*  Number three Joe Biden is now lying about it once again [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=342.12s)]
*  He lied to you the American people before as a candidate as a president and including yesterday if Biden did nothing wrong [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  Why would he be lying? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=353.88s)]
*  Sadly, this is a familiar pattern with Joe when faced with any [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  Adversity Joe Biden lies and he lies over and over and over and over again. Take a look [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=360.48s)]
*  Sir, vice president. How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=367.56s)]
*  I've never spoken my son about his overseas business sounds to most folks like a crisis. Well, look it's way down now [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=373.44s)]
*  We've now gotten control. Are you committed to making sure that the troops stay until every American who wants to be out? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=380.18s)]
*  Yes out. Yes this day [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=387.04s)]
*  30 years ago [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=390.24s)]
*  Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=391.96s)]
*  I had the great honor of being arrested with our UN ambassador on the streets of suede [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh trying to get to see him on Robbins Island the various [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=403.38s)]
*  Shots that people are getting now cover that there there you're okay [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=407.48s)]
*  You're not gonna you're not gonna get kovat if you have these vaccinations [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=411.74s)]
*  Yeah, and wages for working families have gone up while inflation has come down 65% [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  Be crystal clear. No one making [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=421.0s)]
*  Less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in tax for all these things that were in the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=423.62s)]
*  in the buildback better plan [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=430.98s)]
*  Now no one on earth believes those blatant lies, but many in the media mob [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=433.46s)]
*  They're more than willing to ignore them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=437.98s)]
*  Why because Joe Biden's a Democrat instead of investigating Joe's apparent corruption while some so-called journalists in the media mob [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=439.7s)]
*  They would rather bash James Comer for daring to hold Biden accountable watch [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=447.18s)]
*  You're calling it an influence peddling scheme and you don't even know definitively whether or not it's alone. No, you don't know [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=452.7s)]
*  Financially illiterate and you look like a smart guy on TV. Listen, I'm a banker [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, I've been involved in a bank board for a long time [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=465.7s)]
*  The money that the Bidens paid Joe Biden back with came from influence peddling [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=469.34s)]
*  When they made the deposits, but you didn't wrote the check the same day. They had like a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  $2,000 balance I think one account they were overdrawn in and they bet they deposited the same amount of money [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=479.46s)]
*  They wrote to Joe Biden. There's no question. I don't even think [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=485.7s)]
*  Being paid back from alone, I don't think there's any statute that says being paid back from alone [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=491.02s)]
*  All right, sir [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=496.9s)]
*  It does matter if you take money from a drug dealer if you loan money to a drug dealer and that drug dealer pays you back [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=497.7s)]
*  Sir, that's money that he sold drugs. Then you're complicit [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLywERo4waw&t=503.88s)]
