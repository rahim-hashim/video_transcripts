# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 7, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA)
*  It's getting spooky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=2.46s)]
*  That's from Politico. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=5.86s)]
*  Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  They're worried she's running the same Play It Safe campaign, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=11.34s)]
*  up to this point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=14.8s)]
*  She's had about the same number of events as Hillary. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=15.98s)]
*  And crooked had pneumonia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=18.48s)]
*  Since the DNC, Kamala's spent half of her time in DC, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=20.72s)]
*  a third of it without any public appearances. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump is everywhere. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=28.18s)]
*  Anxious Dems wonder why Harris isn't. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=29.580000000000002s)]
*  Kamala's been a ghost. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=32.68s)]
*  And even Vegas is spooked. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=34.42s)]
*  Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=36.58s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=39.28s)]
*  And CNN is gearing up for a horror show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  What happens if the polls are slightly off? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Remember, back in 2020, the polls [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=45.8s)]
*  underestimated Donald Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  So what happens if we have a similar error across those key [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=50.1s)]
*  battleground states? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=53.0s)]
*  Well, if that happens again, look at this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=54.24s)]
*  Donald Trump carries all of these Great Lake battleground [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=56.32s)]
*  states. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=59.36s)]
*  He carries Nevada as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=59.86s)]
*  Of course, he carries Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=61.8s)]
*  And he gets to get this, 312 electoral votes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=64.56s)]
*  So the bottom line is, if we have an error [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=68.0s)]
*  like we did four years ago, Donald Trump [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=69.6s)]
*  is going to win this election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=71.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris is going to lose. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=72.64s)]
*  Joy turning into dread. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  Even Saturday night feels it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=76.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=78.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=80.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=81.52s)]
*  He's out there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=82.02s)]
*  He's doing his thing, whatever that may be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=82.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=87.3s)]
*  Come on, just relax. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=88.3s)]
*  You know, you haven't had a night off in three months. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=89.5s)]
*  Do you want to watch something less stressful, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=91.8s)]
*  like the Menendez Brothers show? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=93.3s)]
*  I don't know, Dougie. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=96.46s)]
*  I kind of wish I had picked Josh right now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=97.3s)]
*  Oh, Josh Shapiro? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=99.64s)]
*  No, Josh. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  Cabernet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=102.4s)]
*  Look, Tim will be fine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  It's not like he's going to say something crazy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  I've become friends with school shooters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=109.58s)]
*  Obama world doesn't find it funny. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  Remember, Kamala was his idea. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=114.33999999999999s)]
*  David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  It's only the most difficult oral exam in the planet [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=119.38s)]
*  for the most difficult job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=122.72s)]
*  So Obama's ordering Harris to do more interviews. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=124.78s)]
*  And the last time a Democrat didn't listen to Obama, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  they got cooed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=130.82s)]
*  So Harris began a media blitz this week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=132.22s)]
*  This is how 60 Minutes went. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=135.12s)]
*  It seems that the president's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=137.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=139.28s)]
*  Well, Bill, the work that we have done [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=142.04s)]
*  has resulted in a number of movements [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=146.24s)]
*  in that region by Israel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=151.24s)]
*  that were very much prompted by [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=153.08s)]
*  or a result of many things, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=157.32s)]
*  including our advocacy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  for what needs to happen in the region. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what she just said there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  Even 60 Minutes told her she's not living in the real world. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  My plan is about saying that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=170.38000000000002s)]
*  when you invest in small businesses, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=175.38s)]
*  you invest in the middle class, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=177.78s)]
*  and you strengthen America's economy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=180.18s)]
*  Small businesses are part of the backbone [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=182.18s)]
*  of America's economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=184.18s)]
*  But, pardon me, Madam Vice President, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=186.18s)]
*  the question was, how are you going to pay for it? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=188.18s)]
*  Well, one of the things that I'm going to make [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=192.18s)]
*  is that we're going to have to pay for it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=194.18s)]
*  And I'm going to make sure that the richest among us [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=196.84s)]
*  who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=198.84s)]
*  But we're dealing with the real world here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=202.84s)]
*  But the real world includes... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=204.84s)]
*  How are you going to get this through Congress? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=206.84s)]
*  You know, when you talk quietly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=208.84s)]
*  with a lot of folks in Congress, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=210.84s)]
*  they know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=212.84s)]
*  No one knows what she's talking about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=214.84s)]
*  Does Kamala even know what she's talking about? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=216.84s)]
*  She was on the Call Her Daddy podcast, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=218.84s)]
*  and she doesn't even understand her own plans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=221.84s)]
*  Another thing that I'm really focused on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=225.5s)]
*  is small businesses and startups. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=227.5s)]
*  And giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=229.5s)]
*  because right now it's $5,000, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=232.5s)]
*  and you can't start up anything, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=234.5s)]
*  any small business with $5,000. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=236.5s)]
*  Does Kamala not know what a tax deduction is? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=238.5s)]
*  She thinks she's giving small business startups 50 grand. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=241.5s)]
*  She doesn't know the difference [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=245.5s)]
*  between a tax deduction and a handout. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=247.5s)]
*  Kamala's also never heard of the draft. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=249.5s)]
*  I want to pose this question more to you and the Daddy Gang, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=252.16s)]
*  but one of the biggest conversations in this year's election [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=255.16s)]
*  revolves around a woman's body. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=259.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yep. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=261.16s)]
*  I want to take a moment, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=263.16s)]
*  and can we try to think of any law [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=265.16s)]
*  that gives the government the power [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=268.16s)]
*  to make a decision... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=271.16s)]
*  I know what you're going to ask. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=273.16s)]
*  ...about a man's body? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=275.16s)]
*  No. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=278.16s)]
*  No. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=280.82000000000005s)]
*  These are any law? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=281.82000000000005s)]
*  No. No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=283.82000000000005s)]
*  It's... No. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=285.82000000000005s)]
*  Besides the draft, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  maybe Vax mandates. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=290.82000000000005s)]
*  Even Andrea Mitchell admits people are realizing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  she's a lightweight. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  I think they've got to double down [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  on doing more interviews and serious interviews. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=300.82000000000005s)]
*  She's got such a big problem with men. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=302.82000000000005s)]
*  I think there's an undercount of the Trump vote. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=304.82000000000005s)]
*  I think there's misogynation in all of them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=306.82000000000005s)]

*  Joe Biden said on Friday, everything that people need, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=842.5799999999999s)]

*  What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=852.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=855.94s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  what do they need after what you saw today? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=857.86s)]
*  Oh, in the storm zone? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=861.5s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=862.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=863.5s)]
*  They're getting everything they need, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=867.14s)]
*  and they're very happy across the board. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=869.02s)]
*  They're getting everything they need. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=873.02s)]
*  They're very happy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=875.5400000000001s)]
*  Federal rescue operations have been slow. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=877.22s)]
*  They have been disjointed, nearly nonexistent. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=879.66s)]
*  According to Biden's DHS secretary, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=882.22s)]
*  FEMA, he's saying, is out of money [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=884.46s)]
*  after the Emergency Management Agency [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=886.62s)]
*  spent a billion of your dollars [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=889.66s)]
*  to feed and house Biden, unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=891.94s)]
*  Borders are Kamala Harris all on board for that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=897.62s)]
*  And meanwhile, the top two stated priorities of FEMA [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=900.66s)]
*  are diversity, equity and inclusion, and climate change. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  Okay, I think their priorities are screwed up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=908.06s)]
*  You would think that the emergency management [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=911.02s)]
*  would be the top of the list [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=913.3s)]
*  and helping every American in need. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=915.18s)]
*  You'd think they would have the money available, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=917.18s)]
*  especially in light of how much money [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=919.2199999999999s)]
*  they give all these other countries, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=920.7399999999999s)]
*  but not under Kamala's so-called leadership. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=922.6199999999999s)]
*  And today, Kamala was most focused on trashing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=925.06s)]
*  Donald Trump and Rhonda Santus [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=927.9799999999999s)]
*  for daring to criticize the administration's response. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=929.78s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=932.9399999999999s)]
*  The other point I'd make is that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=934.02s)]
*  there's a lot of mis and disinformation [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=935.74s)]
*  being pushed out there by the former president [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=938.0600000000001s)]
*  about what is available, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=941.5400000000001s)]
*  in particular to the survivors of Naline. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=943.0200000000001s)]
*  And first of all, it's extraordinarily irresponsible. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=946.5s)]
*  It's about him, it's not about you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=949.7800000000001s)]
*  And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=952.5s)]
*  that are available to folks who desperately need them. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=956.1800000000001s)]
*  Kamala, you've been MIA, Joe's been MIA. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=961.22s)]
*  You're lying and saying everybody's fine, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=964.54s)]
*  everybody's been taken care of and everybody's happy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=966.74s)]
*  Mallorca says you're bankrupt. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=969.9s)]
*  FEMA's website said you gave a billion [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=971.6999999999999s)]
*  to your illegal immigrants. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=973.9399999999999s)]
*  You're not doing your job by going on the, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=975.74s)]
*  you know, call me daddy website. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=978.0999999999999s)]
*  Only about $4 million, that's it, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=980.0999999999999s)]
*  was dispensed from FEMA and it took them a week to show up. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=983.06s)]
*  Thousands upon thousands of Americans [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=987.3s)]
*  have lost absolutely everything. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=989.42s)]
*  They're using horses and mules, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=992.22s)]
*  but not helicopters and government planes in our military. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=994.82s)]
*  Entire towns washed away, roads, highways, bridges, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=999.0600000000001s)]

*  And here is what Kamala was posting on X two days ago. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1013.22s)]
*  Look at this, quote, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1016.1800000000001s)]
*  the people of Lebanon are facing [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1017.34s)]
*  an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1019.54s)]
*  I am concerned about the security and wellbeing [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1022.66s)]
*  of civilians suffering in Lebanon [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1026.3s)]

*  of all civilians in Lebanon. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1031.18s)]
*  But to that end, the US will provide nearly 157 million [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1033.66s)]
*  in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1037.74s)]
*  for essential needs, food, shelter, water, protection, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1041.06s)]
*  sanitation, to help those who have been displaced [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1043.82s)]
*  by the recent conflict. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1046.54s)]
*  This additional support brings total US assistance [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1048.02s)]
*  to Lebanon over last year, it's over 385 million. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1051.26s)]

*  Hundreds of millions of Americans suffering. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  You're telling us about Lebanon? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1063.46s)]
*  What about the suffering Americans in our country? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1065.5s)]
*  Those states impacted by Hurricane Helene. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1068.34s)]
*  What about the people there? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1070.74s)]
*  Our very own Peter Doocy had an opportunity [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1072.42s)]
*  to ask Corrine Jean-Pierre about this earlier today. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1074.54s)]
*  She didn't like the question. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1078.62s)]
*  Peter's 1000% right. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1079.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  On this issue of funding, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1082.5s)]
*  the administration has money to send to Lebanon [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1085.7s)]

*  to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1093.46s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1096.1s)]
*  Here's what I'm gonna be very clear about. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1097.8999999999999s)]
*  The president and the vice president [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1099.78s)]
*  has had a robust whole of government response to this. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1101.1s)]
*  President Biden is fond of saying, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1106.34s)]
*  show me your budget and I will tell you what you value. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1108.2199999999998s)]
*  If he's got money for people in Lebanon right now [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1111.5s)]
*  without Congress having to come back, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1114.9399999999998s)]
*  what does it say about his values? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1116.62s)]
*  There's not enough money right now [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1118.26s)]
*  for people in North Carolina. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1119.78s)]
*  That's not misinformation. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1122.02s)]
*  Wait, no, that is, your whole premise of the question [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1123.62s)]

*  Meanwhile, her husband appeared on A Nanny for 10 Minutes. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1358.06s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1363.7s)]
*  A judge ruled that a Missouri law [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1368.78s)]
*  that forced sex offenders to post no candy signs [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1371.14s)]
*  outside their residence on Halloween [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1375.66s)]
*  is actually unconstitutional. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1378.22s)]
*  Okay, how about a sign that says, sex offender? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1381.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1386.14s)]
*  Problem solved! [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1387.3s)]
*  And finally, researchers have determined [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1389.18s)]
*  that the act of swallowing is actually helpful [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1391.22s)]
*  to your health. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1393.6599999999999s)]
*  See, I told you, said one man. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1395.06s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1397.5s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1399.3799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1402.46s)]
*  So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, PA, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1406.34s)]
*  where roughly three months ago, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1409.02s)]
*  he was almost assassinated by a loser [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1410.58s)]
*  who couldn't make his high school rifle club, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1412.98s)]
*  but somehow managed to get a shot. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1415.18s)]
*  He was a kid at a high school rifle club, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1417.1s)]
*  but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1419.1399999999999s)]
*  It was huge, so huge, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1422.6599999999999s)]
*  the rest of the media had to cover it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1426.5s)]
*  and then it opens with this. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1429.3s)]
*  We love Pennsylvania, and as I was saying... [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1431.54s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1436.26s)]
*  Oh, I love that... I love that chart. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1447.26s)]
*  Yes! [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1450.3s)]
*  Trump's got charts, while Biden's got sharts. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1451.98s)]
*  Elon Musk showed up, jumping around [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1457.6599999999999s)]
*  like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1459.26s)]
*  All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1461.98s)]
*  or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1464.26s)]
*  Crowd was even bigger this time around, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1467.1799999999998s)]
*  and it's solemn, it was funny, and dare I say, joyous. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1469.3s)]
*  Now, compare that to the existential prophecies [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1472.82s)]
*  of a future Trump presidency, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1475.62s)]
*  a threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1478.1s)]
*  Was there anything in Butler resembling that? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1481.82s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people from all over [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1484.58s)]
*  standing together to hear speeches [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1486.54s)]
*  that painted America as a place worth protecting, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1488.54s)]
*  where safety matters, where borders matter, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1491.4599999999998s)]
*  where American jobs matter, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1493.9799999999998s)]
*  where our leaders would actually put our country first. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1495.7399999999998s)]
*  All things that a Harris presidency [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1498.9399999999998s)]
*  would make disappear faster [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1501.1s)]
*  than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1502.78s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1505.7s)]
*  Sensitive theme here. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1510.94s)]
*  That sentence started out so well. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1512.54s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1516.74s)]
*  the people that the legacy media demonises all day long, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1518.7s)]
*  people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1521.86s)]
*  Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1525.7s)]
*  if Trump wins this thing? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1530.06s)]
*  violent retribution if Trump wins. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1532.58s)]
*  This is an increasingly desperate person [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1535.58s)]
*  who's preparing for civil war. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1540.06s)]
*  People right now in the Republican Party [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1542.1s)]
*  are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1545.54s)]
*  a split, you know, a division in the country. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1550.8999999999999s)]
*  What he says he intends to do [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1556.46s)]
*  and when he turns around and says he intends to use [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1558.82s)]
*  Seal Team Six or the military, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1562.18s)]
*  within which to round up his critics or his opponents, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1564.5800000000002s)]
*  he intends to do it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1568.3400000000001s)]
*  He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1569.7s)]
*  and to create enough tension and confusion [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1573.22s)]
*  that you'll have people on the streets [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1575.74s)]
*  protecting and defending him. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1577.8600000000001s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1579.5s)]
*  So you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1581.18s)]
*  That's the sense they want you to have. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1584.8200000000002s)]
*  It's less an election and more of an extortion. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1587.74s)]
*  And sadly, they may be right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1590.78s)]
*  There will be chaos if Trump wins [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1592.38s)]
*  because it'll come from them. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1594.54s)]
*  What they're saying is if you win, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1596.42s)]
*  there will be blood, your blood. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1598.14s)]
*  It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1600.82s)]
*  It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1603.74s)]
*  At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  Democratfellas look like this. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1609.98s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1615.98s)]
*  Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1616.5s)]
*  Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1619.94s)]
*  which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1621.8600000000001s)]
*  during a smash and grab. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1624.7s)]
*  She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1627.1000000000001s)]
*  Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1630.02s)]
*  from her own administration, it's always followed by or else. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1633.42s)]
*  Or else disaster, chaos, a chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1638.3000000000002s)]
*  We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1643.1000000000001s)]
*  San Fran, and Minneapolis. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1645.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1647.94s)]
*  He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1649.62s)]
*  Now, some of us might be a bit scared, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1656.06s)]
*  but that's what they want. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1657.86s)]
*  But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  into a Democrat win because clearly this [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1661.86s)]
*  is their last sure sign of desperation [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1663.9399999999998s)]
*  from a side that doesn't have policy or history [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  or even common sense on their side, only threats. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1669.26s)]
*  But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1672.86s)]
*  it's not working. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1675.62s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1678.22s)]
*  to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1680.3s)]
*  and three others in it showed him that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1682.54s)]
*  Trump came back like he promised. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1684.8600000000001s)]
*  He didn't let them set the limits. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1686.5s)]
*  They took their best shot, literally, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1688.54s)]
*  that he boldly returned to the scene of the crime, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  like Brian Stelter returning to steal from the CNN fridge. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1693.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump showed up saying, forget it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1698.06s)]
*  The threats won't stop us. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  So it wasn't just about Butler but the election itself. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1701.46s)]
*  By gathering all those people in the same field [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1704.66s)]
*  where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1707.1s)]
*  for president, Trump and thousands of others [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1710.5s)]
*  showed that this election can actually [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1712.86s)]
*  be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1714.6599999999999s)]
*  bowing chaos if they don't get their way. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1719.06s)]
*  It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1721.82s)]
*  and democracy is actually the one doing the most [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1724.54s)]
*  to preserve it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1727.58s)]
*  And tens of thousands joined him. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1728.62s)]
*  They're ready to fight, fight, fight with a pres who has [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1730.8999999999999s)]
*  their backs every step of the way. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1734.1799999999998s)]
*  So let the Dems keep telling you that Team Trump will end [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1736.3s)]
*  America as we know it. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1739.78s)]
*  And if they're talking about the way we've known it [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1741.58s)]
*  the past four years, let's hope this is one time they're right. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1743.58s)]
