# This ruling 'protects all former living presidents': Trey Gowdy
**Fox News:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI)
*  Here now with analysis the host of Sunday night in America right here on the Fox News Channel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=0.0s)]
*  My third favorite former House Oversight Committee chairman and former federal prosecutor Trey Gowdy who's joining us [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=5.08s)]
*  Chairman, thanks so much for joining us [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=13.88s)]
*  You know I was watching and a lot of experts were were very concerned about this ruling from SCOTUS [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=16.96s)]
*  In fact, I watched Rosie O'Donnell and she too expressed real serious concern. What's your take? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=23.5s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, I can't tell you the number of people in South Carolina who have been waiting on Rosie O'Donnell to weigh in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=30.12s)]
*  on her opinion of a Supreme Court case that I would be willing to bet you a lot [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I know one of your favorite things in the world would be donuts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=43.64s)]
*  I'll bet you a dozen donuts that she hasn't read the opinion. If you've read the opinion, you know that it also [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=47.08s)]
*  Helps like Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and George Bush and every executive to come [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=54.36s)]
*  It simply means you cannot be held criminally liable for your official acts those acts that are in kind of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  periphery the penumbra [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=70.8s)]
*  Kind of in the shadows of those express [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=74.04s)]
*  Presidential powers you have a presumption of immunity, but there is no immunity for unofficial acts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=76.7s)]
*  So anyone who tells you that a president can order SEAL Team 6 to kill someone and get away with it is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  Either just not really smart can't read the opinion or completely disingenuous [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=89.86s)]
*  But I saw Justice Sotomayor [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  She took a position on that where it talked about some of the extremes and I and I thought but that's not what this ruling says [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=99.06s)]
*  Even though it was the dissent. What was your take on what she said or she wrote? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=105.82s)]
*  For everyone who worries that the court has been politicized just read her dissent [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=111.94s)]
*  Which is why Chief Justice Roberts spent so much time at the end of the majority opinion [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  Kind of undercutting or impeaching the dissent again if you read this majority opinion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=121.66s)]
*  It is crystal clear unofficial acts acts that are outside the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=128.26s)]
*  The the parameters of what a president should do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  There is no immunity Jason. They're treated exactly like you or I would be treated [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=137.58s)]
*  But think about this president Obama ordered the killing of an American citizen that he deemed to be a threat to our national security [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  And the statute of limitations has not run on that on that. So this is an opinion that protects all [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=149.94s)]
*  Former living presidents and those to come it's just that they hate Donald Trump so much they can't get beyond that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=157.14s)]
*  So I've got to shift gears just slightly here because Donald Trump is not totally out of the woods [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=167.38s)]
*  Although he could be but he's not necessarily totally out of the woods [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=172.76s)]
*  There's still it's gonna be a lot of wrangling probably happening after [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=177.17999999999998s)]
*  The election is my is do you read that the same way? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, I here's the way I read Jack Smith's DC case part of it is dead [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=186.54s)]
*  Part of it has a really faint pulse [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=191.33999999999997s)]
*  It's on life support and then you have the fake elector scheme, which is gonna require fact-finding [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=193.38s)]
*  It's gonna require hearings not a trial but hearings [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=198.54s)]
*  Georgia is also a fake elector allegation, but I think that's been made into a lifetime movie [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=203.1s)]
*  I mean, it's so laughable what's happening in Georgia. I don't even consider that to be like a real case [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=209.22s)]
*  That's like a bad romance movie. So then you got Florida. There's not a chance in the world [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=214.74s)]
*  That's gonna go to trial between now and the election and I'm not big on predictions JC, but I'll tell you this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=220.22s)]
*  I'd be willing to guarantee a Trump Department of Justice is not going to prosecute President Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=225.78s)]
*  So I don't want to step out on a limb [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  But I don't think a Trump Department of Justice is gonna go to prosecute the boss that leaves New York [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=232.9s)]
*  It is fascinating that judge Mershon said if such proceedings are necessary [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=239.18s)]
*  Because there were there was evidence from when he was present when Trump was president that was introduced to trial [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=244.34s)]
*  Which cast that a whole proceeding and a brand new light in light of that John Roberts opinion [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=251.34s)]
*  Well Trey Gowdy, I wanted to ask you if you felt more comfortable now that hunter Biden is attending all of Joe Biden's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=259.58s)]
*  meetings and phone calls, but that we're gonna have to hold that for another discussion [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  Hope you talk about that on your show on Sunday night [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=271.46s)]
*  It might be here at the next debate if he if he lets Joe less hunter help [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=275.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe he could be his you know, chief pharmacist or something who knows we'll see. All right [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=281.94s)]
*  Despite calls to replace a Sean Hannity here [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mttS8DhJnbI&t=287.78s)]
