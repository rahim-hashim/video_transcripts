# ‘HUMANITARIAN CRISIS’: Dr. Phil visits the border
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU)
*  All right, Stephen Miller, Tommy Lahren, thank you both for being with us on Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Phil McGraw, he visited the southern border in Texas, meeting with border patrol officials, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=3.68s)]
*  to witness the ongoing crisis firsthand. He rightly criticized the administration for their [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=8.96s)]
*  failures, calling it, quote, a humanitarian crisis, unlike anything we have ever seen before. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=13.92s)]
*  Here with more on his experience visiting the border in Texas, author of the book We've Got [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=20.0s)]
*  Issues, a good friend, the host of the Dr. Phil Primetime Show, Dr. Phil McGraw. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=26.0s)]
*  You know, I've always loved your style, which is just hard hitting, penetrating, straight truth, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=31.44s)]
*  take it or leave it. I'm not worried about your feelings. I'm not sure in this woke world [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=37.2s)]
*  if that's quite as acceptable. I give you credit though, you went down, you went down and you looked [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=41.36s)]
*  at the border yourself. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't really say that they did what you did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=47.6s)]
*  Well, Sean, thank you. I did go down because first off, I'm pro-immigration. You need to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=53.6s)]
*  understand, I think we need immigration in America. We need it for a lot of different reasons, but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=59.52s)]
*  not the way it's being practiced right now. No, you're pro-legal immigration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=65.36s)]
*  I wanted to come in. You're pro-legal immigration. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=69.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. I'm pro-legal immigration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=71.92s)]
*  Well, and we both are, and I know that. And I went down and talked to these gentlemen, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  gentlemen, because I wanted to know from a, you know, one of the most psychological principles, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  one of the most fundamental psychological principles is you don't reward bad behavior. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=85.04s)]
*  And I wanted to go talk to the guys that are, that are heading this up. And I have to tell you, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=90.56s)]
*  you talk about some impressive troops down there. These guys are fighting a morale battle [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  because they can't get what they need. And I wanted to know what's happening down here. What's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=102.0s)]
*  really going on? You know, we hear this number, 6 million people have come across under the current [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=107.84s)]
*  administration. I talked to experts down there that say that number is a myth, that it's closer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  to 13 to 14 million that have come across. And I asked them straight up, what is it you need here? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  And they, I was shocked to hear them say, we don't need more money. We don't need more resources. We [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=128.08s)]
*  don't need more officers. We don't need more legislation. We just need the laws that are on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=136.0s)]
*  the books to be followed. We need to be allowed to do our job and we can get this under control [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=143.12s)]
*  right now. We don't need a bunch more money, officers and legislation. Just let us do our job. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=151.44s)]
*  That's all we need. And if you'll do that, we can get this under control overnight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=156.72s)]
*  You know, Dr. Phil, I've been down there myself over the years, probably 12, 15 times, horseback, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  all-terrain vehicles on foot. You know, I've been out, I've been in the drug warehouses, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, Florida ceiling, you know, drugs that will kill our kids. You know, whatever the number [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  is, 8 million, 10 million, when you count gotaways, illegal immigrants. Here's the thing nobody else [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  wants to talk about. With supporting legal immigration, that to me means, well, every [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=184.64s)]
*  person coming to this country needs to be vetted. They can have radical ties or associations. We [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=191.04s)]
*  need to know that before they come here. We need to know, give them a health check in the middle of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  in a post-pandemic world. We need to make sure they won't be a financial burden on the American [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=202.64s)]
*  people. I think very simple stuff. We have people coming from Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=207.04s)]
*  China and Russia, in tens of thousands combined from those countries. Why do you think they're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  coming over to the southern border? And what are the odds that there are terror cells among that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=221.44s)]
*  large group of people? We would be incredibly narcissistic to assume that these people are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  coming in here just because they're in the neighborhood. They're coming in here with an [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=234.16s)]
*  agenda, Sean. Between 2010 and 2020, it's estimated that 1,100 Chinese came across the southern border. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=238.64s)]
*  In the first 11 months of 23, it's estimated that 33,000 came across, and many of them military-age [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=246.64s)]
*  men. Now, where did they go once they came across the border? We have no idea. They're not being [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  monitored. They're not being followed. And look, in China, you don't just decide, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=260.8s)]
*  you know what, I think I'll take a trip. They have to go through certain steps to get out of China. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=265.68s)]
*  It costs a lot of money to get here. And when they get here, what are they doing? If they're working [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=271.04s)]
*  in farming, if they're working in industry, I'll promise you they are expected to do certain things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=276.56s)]
*  Are they spying? Are they sending seeds back from farming to China? Are they getting plans from [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=282.88s)]
*  industries they're working on? Who knows what they're doing? We don't know, and we need to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=290.08s)]
*  know. And the guards tell me, and I talked to so many of them down there, they said, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=295.6s)]
*  we're not trying to close the border. What we want to know is who, why, and what. Who's coming in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=300.56s)]
*  here? Why are they coming? And what is their business? And we have the right to know that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=306.96s)]
*  to control who's coming into this country. And as I said, you don't reward bad behavior. You don't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=311.68s)]
*  subsidize things that you don't want to see more of. But that's what's happening. And there's an [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=317.44s)]
*  interesting thing that really shocked me, Sean. If they run into someone in a brown uniform, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=322.32s)]
*  that's a Texas Department of Public Safety border guard, they get arrested, they get put in jail, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=328.16s)]
*  and they get returned. If they run into a green uniform, that is a federal, they get money and a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=334.08s)]
*  court date that's seven to 10 years down the road, and they get released into the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=342.56s)]
*  So you see these groups coming across, and if they see a brown uniform, they hide. They see a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=348.0s)]
*  green uniform, they run towards it. And that to me is just insane that we have that kind of difference [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=353.52s)]
*  going on down there with guys working side by side. I really give you a lot of credit. I mean, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=360.32s)]
*  you've spent the time, you went down there, you talked to the people on the front lines. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=365.92s)]
*  Mark my words, Dr. Phil, and I pray to God that I'm wrong, that I can one day say I was wrong. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=369.76s)]
*  Among the 10 million or so illegal, unvetted Joe Biden immigrants, I guarantee you, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=375.68s)]
*  terror cells have mixed among that group, and they're not coming here because they want a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=382.08s)]
*  better life for themselves or their family. And he will then have blood on his hands. That's a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=387.12s)]
*  national security disaster, a clear and present danger. Dr. Phil, thank you. Great to have you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=391.84s)]
*  back. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXf4kjPH7GU&t=397.68s)]
