# Trump hits Biden as 'threat to democracy' in wide-ranging interview
**Fox News:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII)
*  So now, here with more on his plan to make America great again, the 45th President of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=0.0s)]
*  the United States, Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=6.44s)]
*  Mr. President, great to have you back, sir. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=8.44s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  That is some list you read off, and you can probably double and triple it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=13.36s)]
*  It's so bad, I don't think we've ever been in a position like this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=16.8s)]
*  It's terrible what's happened to our country in three years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=19.6s)]
*  Let's start in Iowa, though. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=24.32s)]
*  The largest margin of victory prior to your 30-point win on Monday was Bob Dole in 1988 [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=26.48s)]
*  with about just under 13 percent victory margin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=34.24s)]
*  This is historic in so many ways. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=38.44s)]
*  How do you analyze this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=41.74s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=43.44s)]
*  Why was this bigger than any other Iowa caucus? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=44.44s)]
*  Because the Biden administration is so bad, and we now have a contrast. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  You didn't have a contrast so much before, and now you have a contrast. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=53.44s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  You know, we get the most votes of any sitting president in history, and then somebody else [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  takes over and they take a look at what we had versus what they have now, and the difference [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=62.64s)]
*  is so stark. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=68.82s)]
*  It's so massive. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=70.2s)]
*  It's so different. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=71.2s)]
*  The country is a different place. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=72.2s)]
*  We were respected all over the world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=74.02s)]
*  We got the largest tax cuts ever, the largest regulation cuts ever. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  We rebuilt our military, Sean. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=79.52s)]
*  We did everything, even right to try. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=81.16s)]
*  You know what right to try is if you're able to use some of these incredible new drugs [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=83.26s)]
*  that they're making, bio drugs and other drugs, and people's lives are being saved. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=88.34s)]
*  You never could do it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=92.62s)]
*  You'd have to go to Asia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=93.62s)]
*  You'd have to go to Europe, different places all over the world. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=94.62s)]
*  Now you get them here, and that was a hard thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=97.9s)]
*  Fifty-eight years they tried to get that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=101.06s)]
*  If you were terminally ill, they didn't want to give you a drug, even if they thought it [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=102.78s)]
*  might work, because they said, we don't want to hurt the people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=107.06s)]
*  I said, no, no, they're terminally ill. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  We're going to do something, and we got it done. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=112.36s)]
*  It was not easy either, because the drug companies, nobody wanted it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=114.08s)]
*  The country didn't want it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  They were worried about liability. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=118.08s)]
*  People now sign a document. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=119.72s)]
*  There's no liability, and they can take these drugs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And Sean, we're saving thousands and thousands of lives. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=123.96s)]
*  It's been an amazing miracle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=127.44s)]
*  We did so much, and you would have never had Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=129.76s)]
*  You would have never had the attack on Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=132.76s)]
*  None of these things, and you wouldn't have had inflation because I had oil so low. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=135.24s)]
*  And now we have the exact opposite. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=139.66s)]
*  We have a mess. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=141.28s)]
*  We have the worst president in history. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=142.36s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=144.96s)]
*  And I love the state of New Hampshire. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=147.04s)]
*  I love the people of New Hampshire. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=148.24s)]
*  I don't like their primary system for one reason. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=150.04s)]
*  They have what's called an open primary. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=153.24s)]
*  Already we know that nearly 4,000 Democratic voters have switched affiliation to Republican [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=156.24s)]
*  or undeclared, meaning independent, ahead of the primary, according to the Secretary [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=162.04s)]
*  of State's office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=167.28s)]
*  And it is believed, for example, one woman who's a co-chair of Nikki Haley's campaign, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=169.52s)]
*  her own daughter, a Democrat, changed her affiliation from Democrat to Republican to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=176.48s)]
*  vote for Haley in the primary. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=181.12s)]
*  But even Governor Sununu, not a friend of yours, told her own Neil Cavuto that it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=183.4s)]
*  troubling that many of these people that will switch as Democrats and turn to independents [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=187.4s)]
*  and vote in the Republican primary, that when push comes to shove, that they would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=194.46s)]
*  choose Biden in the end over any Republican. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=198.78s)]
*  I'm not that fond of that system. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=202.66s)]
*  Does that concern you? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  The real clear politics average has you up by 13. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=205.82s)]
*  The Suffolk poll just out today, I think, had you up by 16. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=208.78s)]
*  It was the CNN poll that had you up by 7. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=212.5s)]
*  Does that system bother you? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=215.32s)]
*  It bothers me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=218.94s)]
*  And the governor should have done something about it instead of talking, waste his time [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=219.94s)]
*  with Nikki because she's not going to make it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  She has no chance. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  She's got no way. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  Maggie's not going to be with her. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  And you know, when you said the Democrats voting, no, it doesn't say that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=228.2s)]
*  It said about Nikki that 50 percent of the Republicans would be lost to Nikki, only to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=231.76s)]
*  Nikki, not even to Rhonda Sanctimonious. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=236.92s)]
*  So you know, it's a bad thing for her, but it's a bad thing for us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=239.56s)]
*  Who has a system where Democrats are allowed to vote in the Republican primary? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=242.5s)]
*  And New Hampshire is an incredible place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=247.16s)]
*  I love the people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=249.12s)]
*  We won New Hampshire last time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=250.6s)]
*  It was fantastic what we did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=252.52s)]
*  And you know, we have great spirit, great everything. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  But you need a system, you need a governor that's going to get it changed, not just talking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=256.64s)]
*  about it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=260.72s)]
*  He's been talking about it for four years, never got it done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=261.72s)]
*  So Democrats are allowed to vote, which they're going to vote for her because they don't want [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=264.8s)]
*  to run against me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  They want to run against her. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=270.12s)]
*  You know, it's a very simple system. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=271.12s)]
*  We are leading Biden in every poll. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=273.82s)]
*  Michigan just came out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=275.72s)]
*  We're leading by 11. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=276.8s)]
*  Georgia just came out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  We're leading by 13 points. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  We're leading everywhere now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  And she's not. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=283.16s)]
*  You know, she has one obsolete poll that she likes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=284.16s)]
*  She's about two months old where she was leading Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=286.16s)]
*  Well, those days are gone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=289.68s)]
*  She's not leading Biden anymore. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=291.68s)]
*  The problem is the Democrats want her to run desperately. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=293.44s)]
*  So they have a lot of Democrats signing up in New Hampshire. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=297.12s)]
*  But I don't think it's going to matter. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  I saw one where we're at 50 or 51 and she was at 34, I believe. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=301.88s)]
*  And I think we're going to be in very good shape like we were. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=308.06s)]
*  If you look at Iowa, nobody knew we were going to blow it out like that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=310.52s)]
*  You know, we were at I think it finishes off close to 53. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=313.64s)]
*  We've won by 30 some odd points and nobody thought that was possible. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  We doubled the all time record, more than doubled, I guess, the all time record. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=320.52s)]
*  I think a similar thing is going to happen here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=325.2s)]
*  But here, independents and Democrats are allowed to vote. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  So in order to try and stop Trump, they go out and they sign up and they can sign up [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=330.08s)]
*  very easily. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=334.28s)]
*  And Sununu should have stopped it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=335.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=337.88s)]
*  Let me ask you, I mean, you got a lot of praise for your speech, your victory speech in Iowa. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=338.48s)]
*  And people noticed that you were particularly gracious. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  I noticed in the town hall, the last town hall we did together, the one you did with [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=348.44s)]
*  Brett and Martha, that you seem to have taken on a more gracious tone, if that's the way [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=352.12s)]
*  to say it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=360.8s)]
*  Maybe the question I get asked most often, I've asked you this question before, you know, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=361.8s)]
*  why is Donald Trump always fight so hard? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=367.4s)]
*  Dennis Miller brought this up on the program last night. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=370.84s)]
*  A little bit of humility with Donald Trump will go a long way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=373.0s)]
*  Yes, he's been persecuted. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  His family has suffered. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  He's suffered. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=378.88s)]
*  Yes, it's been unfair, but he fights hard. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=379.88s)]
*  He loves his country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=382.44s)]
*  And sometimes maybe you shouldn't be as personal. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  What was your reaction to that? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, I know it and I know it very well, but we also have to win, Sean. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  If I were a different type of person, I think I would have been out of office a long time [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=392.76s)]
*  ago. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=397.48s)]
*  You wouldn't have even gone through it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=398.48s)]
*  They hit me with Russia, Russia, Russia before the election even. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=399.48s)]
*  I mean, if you look at it, it was before the 2016 election. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=402.36s)]
*  It was all set up and I fired Comey. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=404.92s)]
*  I did a big job. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=407.68s)]
*  We got rid of a lot of the deep state. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=408.92s)]
*  And I will tell you, you know, then we had the COVID come two and a half years later, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=411.28s)]
*  but nobody ever had a better economy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=415.08s)]
*  We're the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  We're the strongest border in the history of our country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=419.36s)]
*  I built over 500 miles of wall. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=421.92s)]
*  We got Mexico to give us 28,000 free soldiers free of charge. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=424.44s)]
*  Not that easy to get, by the way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=429.24s)]
*  I had to do a lot of maneuvering, including tariffs and other things to get it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  But we, you know, by the way, speaking of shares, we took in hundreds of billions of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=435.2s)]
*  dollars for from China. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=438.86s)]
*  And of that, we gave 28 billion to our farmers because they were abused by China. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  What China did to our farmers was horrible. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=445.28s)]
*  And we did a great job for our country. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=447.88s)]
*  Again, the largest tax cuts in history. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=449.68s)]
*  The Democrats want to double up and triple up on the on the taxes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=452.36s)]
*  They want to double your taxes and triple your taxes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=455.88s)]
*  I got you the biggest bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=458.56s)]
*  You and I were talking about that the other day. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=461.0s)]
*  And you called up about the Reagan cuts and our cuts. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  Our cuts were substantially bigger. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  We got rid of the death tax or the estate tax for farmers and small manufacturers. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=468.44s)]
*  You know, I mean, what we did was an amazing thing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  And getting back and getting back to your one part of the question, though, we did all [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=475.72s)]
*  of that and we had to fight off all of the witch hunts and the scandals and the horrible [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  self these people, what they did. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=486.24s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=489.12s)]
*  Fifty one intelligence agents saying that the laptop from hell was created by Russia, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=492.0s)]
*  not by a Hunter Biden. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=497.88000000000005s)]
*  OK, it was Hunter Biden all the way. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=499.72s)]
*  They lied to Congress. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  They lied to everybody. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=503.48s)]
*  Two impeachments that went nowhere. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=504.72s)]
*  They went absolutely nowhere. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  But I mean, if I were a softer individual and I'll tell you something, Ron DeSantis [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=508.72s)]
*  or Nikki or anybody else, if they were in my position, if they were here, they would [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  have been hit just as hard. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=519.12s)]
*  These people play tough, much tougher than the Republicans play. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=520.6s)]
*  And the Republicans have to get tougher. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  But Nikki would I know Nikki very well. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=526.72s)]
*  She worked for me for a long time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=528.44s)]
*  She would not be able to handle that position. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=530.24s)]
*  She would not be able to handle the onslaught. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  With all of that being said, within the Republican Party, I want to bring unity and within the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=535.36s)]
*  nation I want to bring unity. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=540.0s)]
*  And you know, unity is going to come from success because when we had this country prior [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=542.28s)]
*  to covid and then even after covid, but especially prior to covid, the China virus coming in, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=547.48s)]
*  we had the most successful country ever in history. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=553.64s)]
*  There's never been anything like it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=557.2s)]
*  What we did. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  And you know, the other side was calling me and they were coming to me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=559.78s)]
*  They wanted to talk. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=563.38s)]
*  It was all coming together. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=564.46s)]
*  Success will bring everybody under the same tent. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=566.94s)]
*  You know, I covered all of that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=569.5s)]
*  I cannot disagree with you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=572.38s)]
*  And frankly, this show, me personally, I've been vindicated because as many networks peddled [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=574.38s)]
*  their lies and conspiracy theories, we day in and day out, we were peeling every layer [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=580.14s)]
*  of the onion. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=586.22s)]
*  We got the Russia hoax right, as vindicated by the Horowitz report, the Durham report. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=587.3s)]
*  I do want to ask you this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=593.78s)]
*  The last time I interviewed you, I asked you if you think that Joe Biden is going to be [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=595.3399999999999s)]
*  the Democratic nominee and you said no. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=600.02s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=602.4599999999999s)]
*  And if you don't think it's him, who do you think is likely to replace him? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=604.26s)]
*  Look, he can't put two sentences together. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  He can't find the stairs off a stage, which there are a lot of them up there, believe [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=613.68s)]
*  me, they're all over the place. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=618.12s)]
*  He can't find his way off a stage when he makes a very short speech and it has to be [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  short because it can't be long. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=623.72s)]
*  He can't negotiate. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  Look at what's happening. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=627.48s)]
*  The whole world is blowing up. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=628.48s)]
*  You know, Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, very tough guy, smart guy, brilliant [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=629.48s)]

*  He said one thing, very simple, bring back Trump. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=640.2s)]
*  When Trump was here, everybody was afraid of Trump. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=643.04s)]
*  Now, I don't want to say that because I don't like that word, but he said it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  He's probably the toughest leader over there, one of the toughest anywhere, but highly respected [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=649.4s)]
*  and knows he gets it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=653.88s)]

*  And it's true. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  Putin would have never attacked Ukraine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=663.7199999999999s)]

*  I had no inflation and I had the greatest economy ever. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=857.94s)]

*  But by the way, they're working together with other countries, sadly, because it's artificial, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=865.6600000000001s)]
*  because they're going to give it up right after the election. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=870.5s)]

*  It's an artificial reduction. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=875.82s)]
*  But the gasoline was up to $6, $7, $8 a gallon and it still is very high. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=877.94s)]

*  Mexico wouldn't have talked to me that way. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=904.82s)]
*  I have a great relationship with the president. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=906.1s)]

*  They gave us 28,000 soldiers free of charge to guard our border. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=910.5400000000001s)]

*  They thought I was kidding. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=918.7s)]
*  But through a series of negotiations, they gave us everything we wanted. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=920.1s)]
*  Stay in Mexico. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=924.82s)]
*  Remember, remain in Mexico. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=925.82s)]

*  Nobody can come in. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=929.5s)]
*  You think Mexico was happy about that? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=930.9s)]

*  They had you at 52, not at 51. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1101.02s)]
*  They have you up, I think, by 16 now. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1103.9799999999998s)]
*  St. Anselm has you up by 14. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1105.9399999999998s)]
*  These are the most recent polls. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1109.1s)]
*  These are post Iowa polls. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1110.62s)]
*  Well, that's that's in New Hampshire. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1112.06s)]
*  But if you if you look at the national polls in the night, I mean, in New Hampshire, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1113.82s)]
*  we're doing great. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1117.6999999999998s)]
*  And take a look at the national polls. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1118.34s)]
*  I'm up by 65 points. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1120.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, 65. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1122.82s)]
*  And I'm up by 11, 12, 13 points on the Democrats. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1124.1s)]
*  I know you have to run to an event. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1127.9399999999998s)]
*  And by the way, our our deepest sympathy to the first lady on the loss of her mom. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1130.06s)]
*  Please, thank you. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1135.06s)]
*  Convey that to her for us. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1135.74s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1137.6999999999998s)]
*  She was a great woman, John. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1138.6999999999998s)]
*  What is your closing message to the people of New Hampshire? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1140.1799999999998s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1143.3s)]
*  It's make America great again. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1144.3s)]
*  But I think very important before we do this, because you were talking about the Supreme [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1146.5s)]
*  Court, they have two votes that are very important coming up. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1149.78s)]
*  One is, as we discussed, we call it Colorado or whatever. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1152.58s)]
*  But, you know, I really believe they're going to leave the people to vote. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1155.62s)]
*  Again, you're the leading candidate in both parties. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1159.62s)]
*  You're leading the Democrats by many, many points. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1162.34s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine they would do. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1164.58s)]
*  And most states have already approved it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1166.86s)]
*  As you know, very few states have done that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1169.26s)]
*  This is Colorado and a couple of others at this moment. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1171.78s)]
*  But they have another important and that's immunity for the president. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1174.6599999999999s)]
*  The president of the United States, and I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking about [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1177.78s)]
*  any president, has to have immunity because if you take immunity away from the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1181.1799999999998s)]
*  president, so important, you will have you will have a president that's not going to [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1185.1s)]
*  be able to do anything because when he leaves office, the opposing party president, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1189.1799999999998s)]
*  if it's the opposing party, will indict the president for doing something that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1193.9399999999998s)]
*  should have been good, like Obama dropped missiles and they ended up hitting a [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1198.54s)]
*  kindergarten or school or the apartment house. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1202.82s)]
*  A lot of people were killed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1206.26s)]
*  Well, if that's the case, he's going to end up being indicted when he leaves office. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1207.6599999999999s)]
*  He meant well, the missile went in the wrong direction and other things. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1211.74s)]
*  Look at Biden. What would happen to Biden? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1217.7s)]
*  He's killed our country with his policies. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1219.78s)]
*  The border is a disaster. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1222.8600000000001s)]
*  Everything he does is a disaster. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1224.26s)]
*  What he did in Afghanistan is the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1225.9s)]
*  giving him eighty five billion dollars worth of equipment, killing our soldiers, wounding [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1231.06s)]
*  horribly our soldiers and leaving people behind. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, when he leaves office, if he doesn't have immunity now, I think it's horrible [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1238.54s)]
*  what he did, but he probably I don't know. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1243.66s)]
*  It's hard to believe, but he probably meant well. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1245.7s)]
*  It's hard to believe that he meant well, but the man is incompetent. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1248.3s)]
*  But you have to leave. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1251.6200000000001s)]
*  You have to leave immunity with the president. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1253.38s)]
*  If a president is afraid to act because they're worried about being indicted when they [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1255.9s)]
*  leave office, a president of the United States has to have immunity. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1260.66s)]
*  And the Supreme Court is going to be ruling on that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1265.26s)]
*  If they don't have immunity, no president is going to act. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1267.66s)]
*  You're going to have guys that just sit in office and are afraid to do anything. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1270.8200000000002s)]
*  By the way, it is ironic. It took you a long time. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1274.74s)]
*  You were once critical of me for pointing out Joe's cognitive deficiencies. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1277.14s)]
*  I think it's very transparent now for the world to see. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1281.7s)]
*  I was more right than I thought I was. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1284.3000000000002s)]
*  We're looking forward. We'll see you in New Hampshire on Tuesday. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1286.8200000000002s)]
*  We really appreciate your time. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1289.9s)]

*  Yeah, Sean, one thing I wasn't critical of you. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1295.42s)]
*  I was critical of you joking about it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1297.74s)]
*  I wasn't critical of you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd00h0X-KII&t=1300.22s)]
