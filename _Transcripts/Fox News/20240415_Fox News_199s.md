# Trump lawyer: This is absurd
**Fox News:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU)
*  Here with reaction, Trump legal spokesperson Alina Hoppe is back with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, so here we are, 203 days before the election, eight years later. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=5.0s)]
*  Statutory limitations have passed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=11.24s)]
*  They upgraded, misdemeanored and try and use a federal crime to charge Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Your reaction to all of it? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=20.52s)]
*  I think there's a couple of facts that the American people need to know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned that Cy Vance didn't bring this case because he knew it was a loser case. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=27.88s)]
*  The statute of limitations had run and it was based on the now debunked former attorney [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=31.68s)]
*  Michael Cohen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=37.08s)]
*  So what ends up happening, Sean? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=38.44s)]
*  Let's talk about a key part of history here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=40.16s)]
*  President Trump announced that he was running for office again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=43.04s)]
*  And sure enough, D.A. Bragg indites. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=46.44s)]
*  You just played D.A. Bragg's video footage, much like Miss James, who you and I have spoken [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=49.04s)]
*  many times about, who are these Soros backed, politically motivated people who come out [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=54.04s)]
*  and say, I know Trump well, I'm going to do it again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=59.32s)]
*  I did the Trump case. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=61.88s)]
*  I did that case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=63.08s)]
*  Listen, Judge Mershon, Sean, the judge that's hearing this, did the Allen Weisselberg case, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=64.4s)]
*  put him in jail, not once, twice. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=69.56s)]
*  You know who else Judge Mershon's having? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=72.28s)]
*  Steve Bannon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=74.2s)]
*  He has Steve Bannon's case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=75.2s)]
*  This is no coincidence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=76.88s)]
*  And the American people need to know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=78.48s)]
*  And for the next six weeks, I assure you, I will be loud and clear about what is going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=80.08s)]
*  on here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=83.96s)]
*  This is political. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=84.96s)]
*  It's election interference. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=86.24s)]
*  You're not even allowing a father, never mind a former president, but a father attend [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=87.88s)]
*  his son's graduation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=93.16s)]
*  And let's not forget Passover. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=97.24s)]
*  Observant Jews have a right to go and pray to who they want and observe Passover. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=98.24s)]
*  And this judge would not allow it, not for any of the attorneys. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=105.0s)]
*  And there are observant Jewish attorneys on the Trump team and as well on the D.A. team. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=108.24s)]
*  It's just a sad state of affairs for the American people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  I can assure you of that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've said I don't believe the president can get a fair trial in New [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=116.92s)]
*  York, D.C., Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=121.12s)]
*  I just don't believe it's possible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  And if Democrats and these radical prosecutors have their way, all these trials would take [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=126.28s)]
*  place and he'd be in a courtroom the entire 203 days leading up to the election. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=132.68s)]
*  That's the America we're going to live in? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=138.44s)]
*  Yeah, that is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=140.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hunter Biden hasn't seen a courtroom other than for when his plea agreement fell [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=142.76s)]
*  through because the judge read the fine print and saw that he was going to get immunity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=146.6s)]
*  You know, not even allowing a person due process the right to go sit in front of the Supreme [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=150.4s)]
*  Court and hear a case that determines many lawsuits that are currently against President [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=154.88s)]
*  Trump on immunity, on grounds for immunity. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=159.72s)]
*  Let's not forget something here, Sean. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=163.36s)]
*  President Trump was in Washington when this case was going on, when this is happening, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=165.24s)]
*  when somebody made a notation in an accounting record at Trump Organization, he was in Washington [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=169.72s)]
*  taking care of this country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=174.32s)]
*  The absurdity is beyond. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=175.84s)]
*  And I'm going to be talking about it loud and clear so that everybody knows how corrupt [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=177.6s)]
*  New York State has become. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=181.4s)]
*  All right, Alina, we'll be updating people throughout the trial. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=182.88s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD86Q7a4-UU&t=186.44s)]
