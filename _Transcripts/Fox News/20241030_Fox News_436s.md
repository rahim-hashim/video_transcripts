# Trump disregards MSG rally comedian, says he has ‘nothing’ to do with the party
**Fox News:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0)
*  You've created a broad coalition. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe the Republican Party is now the party of hardworking men and women, and the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=3.68s)]
*  Democratic Party is the party of Hollywood, New York, and D.C., coastal elites, as I call [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=8.2s)]
*  them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=13.16s)]
*  If that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=14.16s)]
*  If that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=15.16s)]
*  So you have built a very broad, diverse coalition, including Hispanic Americans, African Americans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=16.16s)]
*  And by the way, I'll put the numbers up on the screen, and we can show people where they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=22.36s)]
*  were in those first three years of your presidency. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=26.88s)]
*  The best growth rate in 60 years, and the people that did best were minorities in America. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=34.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=35.56s)]
*  They did the best. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=36.56s)]
*  And you have built this coalition. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=37.56s)]
*  Anyway, so you have this big event at Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=38.56s)]
*  It went on for hours. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=41.12s)]
*  I don't even know if you were there for the whole thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=43.16s)]
*  I don't know what time you got there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=44.68s)]
*  I was told and made aware that you had no idea about this comedian who made comments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I still have. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=53.36s)]
*  I have no idea who he is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=54.36s)]
*  He said there was a comedian that joked about Puerto Rico or something. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=56.56s)]
*  And I have no idea who it was. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Never saw him, never heard of him, and don't want to hear of him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=61.68s)]
*  But I have no idea. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=65.2s)]
*  They put a comedian in, which everybody does. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=66.2s)]
*  You throw comedians in. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=68.4s)]
*  You don't vet them and go crazy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  It's nobody's fault. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=71.84s)]
*  But somebody said some bad things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=73.76s)]
*  Now, what they've done is taken somebody that has nothing to do with the party, has nothing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=75.88s)]
*  to do with us, said something, and they try and make a big deal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=80.6s)]
*  But I don't know who it is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=84.16s)]
*  I don't even know who put him in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=85.16s)]
*  And I can't imagine it's a big deal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=87.88s)]
*  I've done more for Puerto Rico than any president, I think, that's ever been president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=89.52s)]
*  When the hurricanes came, I rebuilt. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=95.6s)]
*  I helped them rebuild their electrical system. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=98.56s)]
*  I helped them rebuild dams and everything else. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=101.0s)]
*  That place was hit by so many hurricanes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=104.08s)]
*  It's almost like Hurricane Alley. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=106.8s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=110.16s)]
*  Puerto Ricans love me because I was the president that stood up for them more than any president. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=112.92s)]
*  I've had great relationships with Hispanics, but I've had really great relationships with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=117.64s)]
*  Puerto Rico and people from Puerto Rico. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=123.36s)]
*  Every time I go outside, I see somebody from Puerto Rico. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=126.0s)]
*  They give me a hug and a kiss. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=128.76s)]
*  I gave them more money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=130.44s)]
*  I sent a hospital ship when they had one of the big hurricanes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  They had no hospitals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=134.88s)]
*  The hospitals were wiped out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  I sent the big Mercy ship. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=138.0s)]
*  I sent it to Puerto Rico fully equipped. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=140.4s)]
*  It took care of things. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  They love me in Puerto Rico and I love them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  I was there handing out food. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  I got in trouble for that too because we were having fun. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=149.6s)]
*  We had a lot of people and I was throwing paper towels to the back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  They were all having fun. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=154.92s)]
*  And the fake news came. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=156.56s)]
*  Oh, that was very disrespectful to be throwing towels. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=157.56s)]
*  Now, I have unbelievable good relationship with Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Who this comedian was, I have no idea. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=166.44s)]
*  You wish he wasn't there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=168.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's a big deal or not, but I don't want anybody making nasty [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=170.28s)]
*  jokes or stupid jokes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=176.0s)]
*  Probably he shouldn't have been there, yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=178.32s)]
*  Let me ask this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  It seems to, as we come down, as just an American citizen, I've never been more concerned about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  the country, the state, or the world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Especially, we have war in Europe. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=192.24s)]
*  We have war in the Middle East. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=194.0s)]
*  We have a presidential candidate that talks about mandatory gun buybacks and no fracking [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=196.16s)]
*  and no drilling. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=202.12s)]
*  Well, it talks actually about confiscation of your guns. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=203.12s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=205.6s)]
*  Not a buyback. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=206.6s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=207.6s)]
*  They're going to confiscate your guns. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=208.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=209.6s)]
*  If she wins, they will confiscate your guns. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=210.6s)]
*  Ben, the new Green Deal, $93 trillion, eliminate the filibuster, eliminate private health insurance, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=211.6s)]
*  sex change operations and amnesty for illegals, all of this, it didn't get covered by the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=219.48s)]
*  press. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=223.76s)]
*  However, at the end of the day, if you win, this is going to be about the borders, energy, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=224.88s)]
*  the economy, law and order, safe to security. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=235.76s)]
*  It's going to be about healthcare, taking care of people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=239.16s)]
*  It's going to be about things other than what you would typically think coming from me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to take care of our borders immediately, day one. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=246.72s)]
*  We're going to drill baby drill. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=249.16s)]
*  We have more liquid gold than anybody else, including Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=250.56s)]
*  Bigger than last time because you made us energy independent for the first time in 75 years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=253.96s)]
*  You were energy independent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=257.56s)]
*  We would have been energy dominant. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=258.56s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, Anwar in Alaska, I got it approved. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=259.56s)]
*  Reagan couldn't do it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=262.64s)]
*  This is the biggest find anywhere in the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=263.64s)]
*  It's the size of Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=265.52s)]
*  Some people say it might even be bigger. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=267.56s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=269.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia in our country, Alaska, they were already, I got it approved. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=270.12s)]
*  They got everything done. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=273.8s)]
*  Biden comes in. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=275.32s)]
*  The first thing he does is end it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=276.6s)]
*  We would have been supplying oil and gas to China, to all of Asia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=278.6s)]
*  It's Alaska, to Japan. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=285.04s)]
*  It would have been unbelievable. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=288.0s)]
*  We would have been paying down debt. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  He comes in and he rejects it because the environmentalists, oh, reject it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=291.6s)]
*  Has nothing to do with the environment. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=295.36s)]
*  It's good for the environment. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=296.68s)]
*  When you say energy dominant, would you be able to ratchet up production, natural gas, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=297.68s)]
*  where we could provide all the energy needs to say Western Europe? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=307.04s)]
*  And that means Vladimir Putin would be cut off? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  We would have taken over Western Europe. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=314.04s)]
*  Oil prices will go down, and Vladimir Putin wouldn't be able to prosecute the war. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=316.44s)]
*  Look, when they came in, they screwed up my energy program, and the prices went through [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  the roof, and Putin went in. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=326.0s)]
*  If I were president, that would have, number one, we wouldn't have had inflation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Oil wouldn't have gone up like it did. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=332.92s)]
*  But it got close to $100 a barrel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=334.8s)]
*  He made a lot of money during the war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=336.64s)]
*  At $100 a barrel, he makes money. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=338.12s)]
*  At $40 and $50 a barrel, he wouldn't have even thought about doing it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=340.56s)]
*  Biden forced him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=345.8s)]
*  He said, we're going to raise the price of oil. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=348.88s)]
*  Oil went up to $100, almost $100 a barrel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=351.8s)]
*  Would have gone up even more. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=354.76s)]
*  You know, they did. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=356.36s)]
*  They went back to my policy and got it down a little bit, but only a little bit because [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=357.36s)]
*  it wasn't really my policy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=361.76s)]
*  Right now, we would have three to four times more than what we're doing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=364.12s)]
*  But if they didn't go back to my policy, you would have been paying literally $20 a gallon [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  for gasoline for your car. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  They want to get rid of all gas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=378.52s)]
*  I will end that immediately, by the way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=379.76s)]
*  You're going to be able to get a gas-powered car. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=381.4s)]
*  You're going to be able to get a hybrid. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=383.12s)]
*  You're going to be able to get an electric car. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=384.12s)]
*  But they have the freedom of choice to buy what you want. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=386.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=389.36s)]
*  They want to force — and nothing wrong with electric — but they want to force everybody [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=390.36s)]
*  to electric. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=392.68s)]
*  Nobody doesn't want to electric. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=393.72s)]
*  What would your role for Elon be? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=394.72s)]
*  Elon Musk? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=396.72s)]
*  So, Elon has a lot of roles he could take because he's a very exceptional guy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=397.72s)]
*  But he has a thing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=402.56s)]
*  He feels there's such waste, fraud, and abuse in our budgets. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=403.56s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=408.68s)]
*  And he's a great cost cutter. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  And he'll cut costs without anybody even knowing it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=411.92s)]
*  Nobody's going to know it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=414.32s)]
*  Nobody's going to feel it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=415.32s)]
*  He will cut costs. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=417.14s)]
*  And he feels he can save $2 trillion. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  If he does that, our budget is more than balanced. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv5Y48x3v0&t=421.04s)]
