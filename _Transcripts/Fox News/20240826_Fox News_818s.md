# Sean Hannity: The mob is allowing Kamala Harris to get away with this
**Fox News:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, the most deceptive, dishonest, phony presidential campaign in human history [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=1.68s)]
*  rolls on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Apparently, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, they are so toxic and radical and unlikable, frankly [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  dangerous and incompetent, that the Harris campaign is trying as hard as possible to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=13.56s)]
*  hide—hide them away for 70 days until Election Day. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=19.0s)]
*  No sit-down interviews, no press conferences, no town halls, an entire presidential campaign [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  without any direct communication with the voters in our country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=29.16s)]
*  No questions, no interviews, and now little in terms of any specific agenda. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=33.32s)]
*  They don't have time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=38.96s)]
*  I'll explain. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=39.96s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=40.96s)]
*  But at some point this week, we're told Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are planning to finally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  sit down for a joint interview, I'm sure, with one of her adoring contributors and fans [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=47.08s)]
*  and the mob and the state-run media. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=52.1s)]
*  Don't expect any tough questions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Don't expect them to have to answer to their own words. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Just lots of phony joy and laughing and a lot of giggling and lying platitudes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  They're the party of joy and the party of freedom, from two people that would take away [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=64.84s)]
*  more freedom than any administration in history, which I will explain. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=70.24s)]
*  But also tonight, Kamala isn't just dodging tough interviews or any interviews. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=74.96s)]
*  She is also evidently afraid to debate Donald Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=81.02s)]
*  Now, unless, of course, her strict new conditions are now met. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=85.12s)]
*  Now, she refused to do a Fox News debate altogether. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=90.04s)]
*  That was just too risky for someone as incompetent as she is. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=93.56s)]
*  And now, last minute, she wants to change the rules of the upcoming ABC debate, rules [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats themselves demanded in the first place, rules she already agreed to at the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=104.44s)]
*  last minute. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  In contrast to previously agreed-upon rules, Kamala now wants both mics to be hot the whole [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=112.72s)]
*  time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=118.8s)]
*  Now, the reason is obvious, Kamala. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=119.8s)]
*  She wants to manufacture what I will call another I am speaking moment, very similar [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  to the vice presidential debate in 2020. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=129.2s)]
*  You might recall, I'm speaking, I'm speaking, I'm speaking. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=131.5s)]
*  Did you know I'm speaking? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=134.56s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=135.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=136.56s)]
*  She's speaking. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=137.56s)]
*  Because the president wanted people to remain calm. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=138.8s)]
*  Well, let's get to the point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=141.24s)]
*  No, but Susan, this is important. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=143.24s)]
*  Susan, I have to weigh in here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=144.24s)]
*  And I want to add that if—Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=145.24s)]
*  I have to weigh in. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=147.24s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=148.24s)]
*  This is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=149.24s)]
*  And the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=151.2s)]
*  He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=154.44s)]
*  He said he would repeal the Trump tax cuts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=157.4s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=159.4s)]
*  Well, wait. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=160.4s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=161.4s)]
*  It would be important if you said the truth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=162.4s)]
*  I'm so glad we went through a little history lesson. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=165.16s)]
*  Let's do that a little more. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=168.16s)]
*  In 1864— [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=169.76s)]
*  Well, I'd like you to answer the question. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=170.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=172.76s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=173.76s)]
*  Please. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=174.76s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=175.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=176.76s)]
*  If I added the Democratic debates, it goes on and on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=177.76s)]
*  We'll show you tomorrow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=181.76s)]
*  Her favorite debate phrase, you know, I'm speaking. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=182.76s)]
*  T-shirts, ads, fundraising emails, the Harris campaign, they want to manufacture another [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=185.6s)]
*  viral moment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=190.56s)]
*  I am speaking, Mr. Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=191.6s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=193.32s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=194.32s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=195.32s)]
*  She's speaking. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=196.32s)]
*  Because they know even liberal ABC, even there, she's going to get destroyed if the issues [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  are about substance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=202.28s)]
*  And aside from a couple of horrendous economic policies, like the disastrous idea of price [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=203.92s)]
*  controls, the largest tax increase in the history of our country and the history of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=209.72s)]
*  the world, even taxing unrealized capital gains, which is insane and impossible, Kamala [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=214.72s)]
*  has not detailed any other position. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, there aren't even policies or beliefs that are listed on her website. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  The mob, complicit as they are, big donors that they are, they're letting her get away [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=228.64s)]
*  with this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  And according to Axios today, get this news. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Don't expect to hear about Kamala's beliefs moving forward. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=237.72s)]
*  And the reason they're now giving is there's not quite enough time to come up with policy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=241.64s)]
*  positions and beliefs before Election Day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=246.6s)]
*  Not enough time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=250.04s)]
*  Kamala has been in office nearly four years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=251.64s)]
*  She's already run for president one time and detailed a tremendous amount of proposals. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, Medicare for all, universal health care, abolishing freedom and your right to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=259.0s)]
*  private health insurance. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=265.76s)]
*  Oh, that's right, defunding ICE, defunding, dismantling, no bail laws as it concerns police. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=267.36s)]
*  She wants to decriminalize illegal immigration and, of course, offer free health care, housing, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=275.12s)]
*  a running mate wants free college education for the unvetted illegals they allow into [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=281.56s)]
*  the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=286.24s)]
*  She very clearly said she wants to ban fracking and drilling and get rid of the filibuster [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=287.36s)]
*  to pass the Marxist $93 trillion Green New Deal and raise taxes on everyone and everything. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=293.0s)]
*  These are her stated policy positions, in her own words, that the media refuses to show [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  the country unless she tells us something different, but she doesn't get off teleprompter. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=308.28s)]
*  Of course, we know all about her leadership failures as vice president. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=315.24s)]
*  We know she's a failed border czar and as the person in charge of the National Space [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=318.88s)]
*  Council. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=323.24s)]
*  By the way, those poor astronauts, we're going to get them in 2025. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=324.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=327.88s)]
*  But she also played a vital role in the Afghan withdrawal disaster. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=328.88s)]
*  Remember Afghanistan, the disaster? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=333.2s)]
*  Well, tonight marks the three-year anniversary of the terror attack at Kabul International [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Airport. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=340.32s)]
*  Remember, 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 others lost their lives. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=341.32s)]
*  Americans abandoned behind enemy lines and our allies that we promised we'd never do [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=346.8s)]
*  this to. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=351.44s)]
*  They were abandoned behind enemy lines. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=352.68s)]
*  Many of them, by the way, we left a list of who their names are. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=355.16s)]
*  Many of them ripped out of their homes, never seen or heard from again, thanks to Joe and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=358.64s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=363.24s)]
*  And while mass chaos was unfolding at Kabul's airport, it was one of the most devastating, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=364.24s)]
*  humiliating moments in American history, and it was all caused by Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=369.2s)]
*  Harris, who brags about playing a critical role in that decision to begin the deadly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=374.8s)]
*  withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=380.0s)]
*  You might remember, Kamala, in her own words. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=381.48s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=384.24s)]
*  President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, particularly [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=385.92s)]
*  for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=390.48s)]
*  He just made a really big decision. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=395.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=396.44s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=397.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=398.44s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=399.44s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=401.44s)]
*  And I'm going to add to that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=402.44s)]
*  This is a president who has an extraordinary amount of courage. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=408.44s)]
*  No, that wasn't courage. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  As the country of Afghanistan was rapidly collapsing in horrific scenes of carnage and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  chaos unfolded in real time, Kamala's all smiles just days before service members were [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=422.0s)]
*  killed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=429.46s)]
*  So, I'm going to – hold on. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Slow down, everybody. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=434.78s)]
*  I want to talk about two things. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  First, Afghanistan. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=439.76s)]
*  We couldn't have a higher priority right now, and in particular, our priority is making [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  making sure that we safely evacuate American citizens, Afghans who work with us, Afghans [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=448.56s)]
*  at risk, including women and children. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=455.56s)]
*  And that is one of our highest, if not the highest, priority right now. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=458.56s)]
*  What's so funny? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=463.56s)]
*  Thirteen Americans are dead, and we had hundreds of Americans abandoned behind enemy lines, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=466.56s)]
*  our allies abandoned, and many of them ended up dead. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=471.56s)]
*  And by the way, today Trump, not Kamala, not Joe, they went to Arlington National Cemetery, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=475.56s)]
*  President Trump did, to honor the service members who were murdered during that terror [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=481.56s)]
*  attack at Cobbles Airport. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=486.56s)]
*  Joe Biden, he couldn't be bothered. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=488.56s)]
*  He's now on his second consecutive beach vacation without a care in the world. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=490.56s)]
*  And we have no idea what Kamala Harris was doing today earlier while President Trump [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=494.56s)]
*  had this to say, you know, as it relates to this very solemn, sad anniversary. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=499.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=504.56s)]
*  Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=505.56s)]
*  credibility and respect all around the world. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=516.56s)]
*  Our country will never be safe again until we have fired those responsible for this disaster. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=519.56s)]
*  When I take office, we'll ask for the resignations of every single official. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=526.56s)]
*  We'll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=534.56s)]
*  calamity to be on my desk at noon on Inauguration Day. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=545.56s)]
*  Where's Kamala Harris? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=551.56s)]
*  Why didn't she give a speech taking responsibility for the tremendous failures in Afghanistan? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=553.56s)]
*  You just saw it three years ago. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=559.56s)]
*  She was bragging about its success and being the last person in the room making the call [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=561.56s)]
*  to leave Afghanistan. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=565.56s)]
*  And now she's MIA, missing in action. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=567.56s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=569.56s)]
*  You know, how much more pathetic can you get? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=570.56s)]
*  Kamala's now pretending she wasn't around three years ago. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=573.56s)]
*  She had nothing to do with the withdrawal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=576.56s)]
*  She wants Americans to believe that she's not an incumbent. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=578.56s)]
*  And on day one, I'm going to fix inflation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=582.56s)]
*  On day one, I'm going to fix the border. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=584.56s)]
*  What have you been doing the last three and a half years? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=586.56s)]
*  You are the vice president of the country and that what you're not responsible for [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=589.56s)]
*  the border crisis or inflation or any of the other failures of the administration that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=594.56s)]
*  bears her name. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=599.56s)]
*  It's the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=600.56s)]
*  Instead, everything is Donald Trump's fault. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=603.56s)]
*  Somehow Democrats who have been in charge for what, 12 out of the last 16 years are [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=605.56s)]
*  completely blameless for any of our woes. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=611.56s)]
*  The dog bites, the bees sting. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=614.56s)]
*  You're feeling sad. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=616.56s)]
*  Just blame Trump. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=617.56s)]
*  Hate Trump and call it joy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=618.56s)]
*  You know, have no agenda whatsoever. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=620.56s)]
*  Take away people's freedoms and say that you're for the Freedom Party because that's what's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=622.56s)]
*  happening. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=626.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=627.56s)]
*  Donald Trump would sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining his own pockets [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=628.56s)]
*  and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=634.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=637.56s)]
*  Take Donald Trump and JD Vance. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=638.56s)]
*  But let me tell you what a radical agenda is. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=640.56s)]
*  And that is Trump's Project 2025. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=647.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=652.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=653.56s)]
*  In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=654.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=658.56s)]
*  When President Trump. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=659.56s)]
*  The truth is Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than it means to his ends. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=660.56s)]
*  To Donald Trump. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=667.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=668.56s)]
*  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=669.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=675.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=676.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=677.56s)]
*  But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=684.56s)]
*  They lie about abortion. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=693.56s)]
*  They lie about Project 2025. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=695.56s)]
*  They lie about the economy. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=697.56s)]
*  They lie about immigration. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=698.56s)]
*  They lie about everything. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=699.56s)]
*  This is the most bizarre, dishonest campaign in history. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=702.56s)]
*  To sum it up, a person that got zero primary votes, has conducted zero interviews, zero [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=708.56s)]
*  press conferences, and doesn't have any stated policy positions on her website, may [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=714.56s)]
*  not have time between now and Election Day, wants your vote because she hates Donald Trump, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=719.56s)]
*  and they hope you do too, even if your life was significantly better, which it was under [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=725.56s)]
*  the last administration. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=731.56s)]
*  They claim to be, as I said, the party of joy and the party of freedom. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=733.56s)]
*  But they want to take away your guns. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=737.56s)]
*  They want a mandatory gun buyback. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=738.56s)]
*  They want you and your family to pay for the unvetted, illegal immigrants that they are [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=740.56s)]
*  allowing into their country. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=745.56s)]
*  They want you to pay for their housing, their healthcare, education, even college education [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=746.56s)]
*  in Minnesota. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=750.56s)]
*  They want to force you to pay more for energy and by banning fracking and banning drilling. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=752.56s)]
*  The Freedom Party, the Joy Party, they want to take away your gas-powered vehicles. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=758.56s)]
*  They want to force an EV into your driveway, whether you want one or not. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=763.56s)]
*  The Freedom and Joy Party wants to take away your private healthcare system. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=767.56s)]
*  The Freedom and Joy Party wants to force feminine hygiene products into boys' bathrooms. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=771.56s)]
*  And in Minnesota, they want to give your children gender-affirming care and take away your knowledge [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=777.56s)]
*  and your consent. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=783.56s)]
*  In other words, you're right as a parent. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=784.56s)]
*  What joy, what freedom. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=786.56s)]
*  But in 70 days, well, frankly, it is less than that, because three weeks from tomorrow, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=788.56s)]
*  early voting begins in Pennsylvania. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=793.56s)]
*  That is 22 days from today, and mail-in ballots go out in places like North Carolina in two weeks. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1z1ZNAYQk&t=796.56s)]
