# Sen. Josh Hawley: These students are a 'disgrace'
**Fox News:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk)
*  All right, this is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=0.0s)]
*  You are looking at live pictures of an anti-Israel protest on the campus of the University of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=4.48s)]
*  Southern California in Los Angeles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=9.64s)]
*  And tonight, with anti-Semitic protests raging at Columbia and New York City and other elite [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=12.46s)]
*  campuses around the country, well, Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, they are now calling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=18.0s)]
*  on Biden to take action and mobilize the National Guard to protect Jewish students. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=23.12s)]
*  With Senator Hawley likening the situation to Eisenhower's decision to send the National [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=29.04s)]
*  Guard to protect the Little Rock Nine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=34.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden's rampant hypocrisy back in the spotlight tonight, this time over his [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=37.36s)]
*  use of TikTok. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=42.0s)]
*  Remember, he just signed a law to force the sale of the app in nine months or ban it entirely [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=43.0s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=49.76s)]
*  His campaign announced they're going to continue to use the Chinese-owned social media platform. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  And with reaction, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, Senator, let's talk about the guard [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=58.28s)]
*  that you're calling for, which I believe would be the right call. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=62.84s)]
*  But I don't see Biden wanting to alienate his radical base. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=67.04s)]
*  I think that's why he's not going to do it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=70.56s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=72.8s)]
*  I mean, this is all about the fact that he has a pro-Hamas base, Sean. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=73.8s)]
*  But listen, Eisenhower did the right thing back in 57 when he sent the 101st Airborne [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=78.48s)]
*  to Little Rock. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=83.28s)]
*  Why not do it for Jewish Americans? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't be that in this country, in this day and age, that if you are a Jewish American, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=86.72s)]
*  you fear for your life because all of these bougie jihadists at these universities whose [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=91.28s)]
*  brains are addled by TikTok are out there calling for your death, calling for the destruction [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=96.16s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=101.64s)]
*  I mean, what is going on on these campuses? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=102.64s)]
*  Send in the National Guard and wake these kids up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  They ought to know they can't do this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=107.92s)]
*  They ought to know they don't have any right to occupy these campuses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=110.32s)]
*  They don't have any right to threaten their fellow students. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=112.68s)]
*  They ought to snap them out of it and the National Guard would help do it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=115.24s)]
*  But aren't they supposed to be the best and brightest? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Isn't it supposed to be hard to get into an Ivy League institution? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=121.28s)]
*  Could they really be that ignorant? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=124.96s)]
*  Do they not realize that in countries that believe, that take on Sharia law, radicalized [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=126.36s)]
*  countries like Iran, for example, if you're gay or lesbian, they'll murder you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  If you're a woman and you're not fully covered, they'll beat the hell out of you among the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=138.32s)]
*  many other restrictions and civil rights violations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=143.16s)]
*  Whatever happened to the woke left in this country? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=147.34s)]
*  Whatever happened to the belief in women's rights and gay rights and all the things they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=151.16s)]
*  said they believe in? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=154.86s)]
*  Are they just willing to bifurcate their brains and ignore that which they said that they [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=156.12s)]
*  were so passionate about? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=163.12s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=165.12s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=166.12s)]
*  That's 100% what they're willing to do, Sean. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=167.12s)]
*  And you can just see, I mean, listen, these are the people who are standing around wearing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  N95 masks outdoors doing interpretive dance and calling for jihad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=172.38s)]
*  I mean, these are insane people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=178.42s)]
*  As I said, I mean, they're spending way too much time on TikTok and social media. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=180.6s)]
*  Their brains are rotted and their brains have been rotted by the university system, Sean. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=183.7s)]
*  These universities are cash machines. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=188.66s)]
*  They are sitting on giant endowments. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=190.78s)]
*  They're not really educational facilities. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=193.14s)]
*  They're giant private equity funds who have taken your money, taxpayer money, and now [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=195.1s)]
*  are using it to pump out this pro-Hamas propaganda. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=200.34s)]
*  It's a disgrace to this country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=203.58s)]
*  These students are a disgrace. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  And all of this needs to end. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  We know what this is about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=210.74s)]
*  Joe got freaked out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=211.74s)]
*  Over 100,000 Democratic primary voters in Michigan voted for undecided or uncommitted, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=213.1s)]
*  rather. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  That's over 100,000. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  That was 18.9% of Democratic presidential primary voters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  50,000 in Wisconsin. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=228.42s)]
*  About 40,000 yesterday in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=231.98s)]
*  So we know what he's freaked out about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=235.14s)]
*  Let me get your reaction. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=236.98s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden just signed a law that says that TikTok has to be sold in nine months [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=237.98s)]
*  or it's going to be banned in the U.S., but his campaign announced that they're going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=243.5s)]
*  to continue to use it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=247.88s)]
*  Can you explain that logic to me? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=249.1s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=251.1s)]
*  It's because his campaign is run by a bunch of pro-Hamas TikTokers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=253.14s)]
*  I mean, that's why. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=256.14s)]
*  This is all about pandering to his base. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=258.06s)]
*  And they have decided that his base are a bunch of pro-Hamas radicals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=260.42s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=264.46s)]
*  Joe Biden himself, I mean, Sean, he doesn't know how to use an iPhone. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=265.98s)]
*  He probably doesn't know how to use a flip phone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=269.14s)]
*  I mean, he's not doing this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=270.74s)]
*  This is all about the people who are running his campaign for him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=272.44s)]
*  And they will do anything to pander. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=275.66s)]
*  And I tell you what, the amount of pro-Hamas propaganda on TikTok, I mean, it is a propaganda [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=278.1s)]
*  factory pushing out this propaganda from China, trying to divide the country, trying [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=284.5s)]
*  to destroy Jewish Americans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=290.42s)]
*  And the Biden administration, they're happy to go along with it because they want these [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=292.78s)]
*  people's votes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=295.9s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=297.38s)]
*  Anyway, we really appreciate your time, Senator Josh Hawley. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=299.06s)]
*  I hope it's not happening in your state of Missouri. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=302.46s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lAtLMPUsdk&t=314.5s)]
