# Hannity: Harvard's president has just been given a free pass
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, Joe Biden trashing Republicans during a press conference with Ukrainian President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=5.68s)]
*  Zelensky, all because they are making border security a top priority. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=10.44s)]
*  Now, the president always seems to fly off the handle when talking about the GOP, while [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=15.36s)]
*  giving America's geopolitical foes a free pass, even as they try to kill U.S. soldiers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  abroad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  We have just 100 attacks in, oh, a little over a month. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=27.24s)]
*  We have a full report straight ahead tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=30.28s)]
*  But first, the president of Harvard is now getting a free pass. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=32.28s)]
*  Claudine Gay just received what is a unanimous vote of confidence by the university's governing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=36.08s)]
*  board after this abhorrent testimony about genocide and virulent anti-Semitism now festering [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=42.18s)]
*  all over her campus. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=50.24s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  So, the answer is yes, that calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard code of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=53.6s)]
*  conduct. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=59.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=60.64s)]
*  Again, it depends on the context. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=61.64s)]
*  It does not depend on the context. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  The answer is yes, and this is why you should resign. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=67.28s)]
*  These are unacceptable answers across the board. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=70.56s)]
*  She said it would depend on whether actions were associated with it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=74.16s)]
*  Claudine Gay knows the context. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=78.16s)]
*  A global antifada is a demand for violence against Jews, the elimination of Israel, and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  when protesters hold signs that read, by any means necessary, they are praising what are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=87.84s)]
*  the barbaric terrorist attacks on October the 7th and calling for more of the same. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, the entire student body at Harvard, they have been harassed by radical Hamas sympathizers [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  ever since October the 7th and that terror attack, but Claudine Gay didn't seem to care. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=105.16s)]
*  Two days ago, UPenn's president resigned in disgrace after providing a similar response [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  at that very same congressional hearing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=116.2s)]
*  But at Harvard, their president will skirt by with a simple apology. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=118.88s)]
*  Claudine Gay is, quote, sorry if she offended anyone. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=123.6s)]
*  I don't consider that an apology. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, Gay told the Harvard Crimson that she, quote, got caught up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=129.96s)]
*  In what had become, at that point, an extended combative exchange about policies and procedures. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=135.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=141.24s)]
*  According to Gay, Harvard takes free speech and free expression very seriously. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=142.24s)]
*  But in reality, in truth, well, she's wrong, because this year Harvard was named the worst [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=147.0s)]
*  school when it comes to freedom of speech in America by scoring a whopping 0.0 in a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=153.56s)]
*  study by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=160.0s)]
*  Now, seven of its professors were disciplined for saying or writing something that the university [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=163.88s)]
*  deemed offensive. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=169.55999999999997s)]
*  One feminist lecturer said Harvard canceled her and her speech because she does not, quote, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=171.16s)]
*  believe there are male women. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  There are strict rules against certain types of speech that are deemed hateful, including [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=178.88s)]
*  discussions that could be labeled as transphobic or fatphobic. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=188.88s)]
*  At Harvard, apparently now obesity is off limits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=189.88s)]
*  But when it comes to the Jewish people, anything goes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=192.44s)]
*  So make no mistake. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=196.2s)]
*  Claudine Gay's so-called apology, it was disingenuous, but it gets worse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=197.2s)]
*  At one point during her apology, Harvard's president said, quote, I failed to convey [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=202.32s)]
*  what is my truth. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=207.76s)]
*  My truth? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=209.8s)]
*  The president of Harvard thinks she owns a special version of truth? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=210.8s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=215.92s)]
*  Is it true that Israel was a victim of terrorism? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=216.92s)]
*  Is it true that innocent Israelis were slaughtered and murdered and raped and some beheaded and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=221.72s)]
*  some taken prisoner and kidnapped? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=227.8s)]
*  But of course, her version of the truth is probably lacking in originality. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=230.56s)]
*  Now, of the few academic papers that Claudine Gay has actually managed to publish over the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=234.24s)]
*  past two decades, well, now we also know that many were allegedly plagiarized. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=240.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=246.8s)]
*  And what is supposed to be America's most prestigious university is an accused of plagiarism [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=248.52s)]
*  on top of everything else. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=255.36s)]
*  According to the Harvard Crimson, quote, the Crimson independently reviewed the published [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=257.0s)]
*  allegations, though some are minor, consisting of passages that are similar or identical [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=261.44s)]
*  to Gay's sources, lacking quotation marks, but including citations, others are more substantial, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=267.2s)]
*  including some paragraphs and sentences nearly identical to other work and lacking citations. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  And according to University Policy, a student at Harvard could actually be expelled for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=281.44s)]
*  such an infraction, but not Claudine Gay, the president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=286.08s)]
*  Harvard's board is now allowing her to go back and amend her publications. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  And here's how Congresswoman Elise Stefanik responded to this earlier today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=297.8s)]
*  This is a moral failure of Harvard's leadership and higher education leadership at the highest [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=298.8s)]
*  levels. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=304.16s)]
*  And the only change they have made to their code of conduct, where they failed to condemn [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=305.16s)]
*  calls for genocide of the Jewish people, the only update to the code of conduct is to allow [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=311.16s)]
*  a plagiarist as the president of Harvard. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=317.16s)]
*  Now, by some estimates, Harvard has lost billions of dollars in donations because of Claudine [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  Gay, but the school would rather stand by its president than admit the moral and academic [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=325.16s)]
*  rot that is destroying American colleges and poisoning the minds of young students. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsGSnn582A&t=330.6s)]
