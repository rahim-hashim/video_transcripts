# Tim Scott: The media is not showing the truth of who Biden has always been
**Fox News:** [May 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA)
*  More South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, Senator, the demographics change. Well, let me ask [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=0.0s)]
*  you first question. How is it that Joe Biden, we played that tape of Joe Biden and the things [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=6.72s)]
*  he said, you ain't black and you know, they're going to put you all back in chains. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=11.78s)]
*  Back in chains. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=16.96s)]
*  But to me the worst thing is- [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=17.96s)]
*  Disgusting comments. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=18.96s)]
*  The thing that is the most unbelievable to me, and if it were a Republican, it probably [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=20.96s)]
*  would be career killing, which is him partnering with his friend and mentor, a former Klansman, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=27.38s)]
*  to stop the integration of public schools and busing. Even Kamala Harris criticized [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=34.9s)]
*  him for that in that presidential primary debate in 2020. I was that girl, I believe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  she said, and because he didn't want public schools, his words to be racial jungles. Am [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=48.22s)]
*  I like the only one in the country that dares to bring this up and ask incredulously, why [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=55.22s)]
*  doesn't anyone care about that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=62.44s)]
*  You know they're not playing that on CNN. You know they're not playing it on MSNBC. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=66.46s)]
*  They are not sharing the truth of who Joe Biden has always been. We should run commercial [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=71.16s)]
*  after commercial with Kamala Harris telling Joe Biden what he did in the 60s, and in addition [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=77.5s)]
*  to that, we should make sure that his words of the jungle, what a disgusting reflection [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=84.22s)]
*  on who he is. I will say this without any question, jobs and justice are moving more [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=91.46s)]
*  black folks towards Donald Trump because we want fairness and what we hear from Joe Biden [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=97.74s)]
*  over and over again is a pandering tour. But you're 100% right to associate with a race [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=103.48s)]
*  as a KKK member and to celebrate it. You can only do that when all of the national media [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=110.3s)]
*  goes dark. They won't cover any negative news on Joe Biden. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=117.22s)]
*  Let's look at this. Donald Trump didn't win Nevada in 16 and 20. He's up by 13. New York [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=123.82s)]
*  Times. Then you look at Arizona, up by seven. Then you look at Michigan, up by seven. Then [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=130.82s)]
*  you look at Georgia, up by 10. Then you look at Pennsylvania, up by three. Down by two [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=137.46s)]
*  in Wisconsin. Okay. So that is huge. But what's interesting is every poll is showing the same [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  thing, that Joe Biden's base, his coalition base in the Democratic Party, he's losing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=151.68s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and young people. How do you interpret that? Why [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=160.06s)]
*  is that happening? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=165.92s)]
*  The coalition is imploding. The literal four is being broken up because now they have the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  contrast between Joe Biden's years in office and Donald Trump's years in office. And you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=176.48s)]
*  look at two categories. I just said it a second ago. Jobs. Joe Biden has destroyed, devastated [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=182.0s)]
*  the black community with inflation and joblessness. African American unemployment is now 6.4% [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=188.04s)]
*  and still climbing. But the only thing higher than that is inflation. Today, it costs you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  40% more money to put gas in the car. 30% for food on your table, 25% for energy for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  your home. Those numbers are devastating for single moms and people working paycheck to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=209.88s)]
*  paycheck, especially in the black community where you have a high concentration of poverty. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=214.56s)]
*  But that's true in every community. The second truth is we as a nation, and our DNA is fairness, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=219.16s)]
*  Alvin Bragg has made an in kind contribution to the Democratic National Party for one reason, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  to beat Donald Trump. And he's paying for it at the expense to New York taxpayers. Everyday [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=233.6s)]
*  Americans and I believe African Americans specifically are saying a two tiered justice [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  system weaponizing justice against a former president. If they'll do that to him, what [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=246.28s)]
*  will they not do to me? Those two issues are driving millennials, African Americans, white [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=252.16s)]
*  folks, Hispanics, Asians, all to look at Donald Trump and his four years in office. And they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=258.56s)]
*  saying the same thing you and I would say, Sean. The border was closed. The economy was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=265.56s)]
*  strong. Inflation was low. Enthusiasm was high. Law and order everywhere. Crime and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=270.52s)]
*  violence nowhere comparatively speaking to what we see today. It's an easy conclusion [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  on why Joe Biden is sinking in the polls and Donald Trump seems to be on a springboard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=286.0s)]
*  It's pretty remarkable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=293.0s)]
*  All right, Senator, say hi to our mutual friends when you see them. Appreciate you being with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=294.08s)]
*  us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTOANTOgmA&t=298.68s)]
