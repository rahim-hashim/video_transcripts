# Delaware judge a reason for Hunter indictment: Dershowitz
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc)
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, along with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg, we'll begin with you tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=6.0s)]
*  You've been following this story. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=7.48s)]
*  You've been writing column after column. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=8.84s)]
*  I want to go to the heart of this issue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=11.28s)]
*  I have been calling this the Joe Biden bribery and money laundering scandal allegations. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=12.88s)]
*  Does this take us one step closer tonight to Joe Biden, the president, and his involvement [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=19.6s)]
*  and his lying to the country? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=25.46s)]
*  It does. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=27.48s)]
*  His complicity, Sean. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=29.42s)]
*  The evidence is mounting that Joe Biden, as you say, actively aided and abetted his son's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=30.94s)]
*  schemes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=37.06s)]
*  He's been lying about it all along, and everybody knows that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=38.06s)]
*  He even lied about it yesterday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=40.74s)]
*  There's documents, testimony, White House logs, emails, text messages that prove that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=44.02s)]
*  he talked by phone with Hunter's clients. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=50.38s)]
*  He met personally with his son's overseas partners. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=53.02s)]
*  He even attended their meetings that were closely guarded. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=56.42s)]
*  Joe Biden appears to be complicit in pushing the Biden brand, which was selling access [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  to him, promises of influence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=67.62s)]
*  Devin Archer confirmed that Joe sent signals and operated as leverage for all of that money, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=70.26s)]
*  millions of it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=77.06s)]
*  It's obvious that Hunter was selling his dad to the world and the family was getting rich [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=79.26s)]
*  from it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=83.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether Joe pocketed a single penny of it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=84.74s)]
*  Under the bribery statute, it's still a crime if the money goes to any other person or entity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  other than the public office holder. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=96.78s)]
*  Of course, as you pointed out earlier, bribery is an impeachable offense. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=99.38s)]
*  By the way, there's no statute of limitations on impeachment, as there were in some of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=103.86s)]
*  charges that David Weiss allowed to lapse intentionally. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=110.98s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, I doubt you would disagree with us on the issue of Joe Biden lying. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=116.18s)]
*  It is now clear that he lied to the country when he said he never spoke to his son, brother [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=119.94s)]
*  or anybody for that matter about their foreign business dealings, but it's bigger than that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=124.5s)]
*  Because Hunter, in his own laptop, the very real laptop, not the fake laptop that the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=130.06s)]
*  media claimed, but he implicates his father. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=135.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=139.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=140.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=141.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=142.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=143.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=144.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=145.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=146.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=147.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=148.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=149.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=150.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=151.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=152.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=153.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=154.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=155.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=156.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=157.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=158.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=159.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=160.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=161.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=162.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=163.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=164.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=165.58s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=166.58s)]
*  John Bobulinski, the big guy, money set aside for this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=167.58s)]
*  None of this would be happening but for Joe Biden, but if you focus on one issue, professor, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  this is what stands out in my mind. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=177.5s)]
*  Hunter Biden said he had no experience in energy, oil, gas, coal or Ukraine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=179.58s)]
*  Now, if you look at the Burisma example, he's paid millions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=187.46s)]
*  In that case, we know Joe Biden leveraged a billion dollars. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=191.9s)]
*  Then we have that What's At message. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=196.46s)]
*  This involves CEFC. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  That is the Chinese oil conglomerate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=200.62s)]
*  Again, no experience in energy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm sitting here with my father. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=204.78s)]
*  We're wondering why you did not fulfill your commitment between—he will use everybody [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=206.46s)]
*  he knows and my ability to hold a grudge. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=212.88s)]
*  You will regret not following through with what you agreed to. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  A few days later, $5 million shows up in one of those bank accounts, Professor, what James [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  Comer is calling shell corporations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=226.3s)]
*  Tell me, Professor, what does that look like to you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=228.78s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's remember who's responsible for all of this coming out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  We have to give credit to Judge Noriega. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  Judge Noriega made sure that this was not all covered up by a deal that made no sense. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=240.5s)]
*  Since I predicted on your show and other shows that Judge Noriega would not accept the deal, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=247.78s)]
*  I was trashed for it by many academics, by CNN, by many other media, but she did the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  right thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=260.34s)]
*  She sent it back, and the result has been now much more information coming out to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=261.34s)]
*  American public. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=267.46s)]
*  As I've said before, I hope that this results in the appointment of a real, real special [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  counsel outside the Justice Department looking at the president of the United States, because [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  if it becomes just an impeachment concern, then half the country won't believe it, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=280.98s)]
*  half the country will. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  The same thing happened with Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  But if there's a special counsel who's credible and who can get to the bottom of this and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=288.1s)]
*  either clear President Biden or accuse President Biden, I think the American public will probably— [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=293.06s)]
*  Professor, let me stop you here, though. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=299.66s)]
*  —that and what else. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=301.74s)]
*  Because we have Merrick Garland, by the way, contradicted by David Weiss and David Weiss [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=302.74s)]
*  contradicted by Merrick Garland by the whistleblower testimony. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=307.66s)]
*  Originally, we know that Mr. Weiss planned on bringing no charges. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=311.58s)]
*  That evolved into that sweetheart deal with no time spent in jail. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=316.94s)]
*  That fell apart in front of that judge that you rightly praise, who said to the prosecutors, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=321.66s)]
*  you've never seen a deal like this before. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=327.46s)]
*  OK, the prosecutors had to admit, no, they never did. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=330.18s)]
*  OK, now we're back at the drawing board. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=333.62s)]
*  Merrick Garland then appoints the guy that allowed the statute of limitations on the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=335.88s)]
*  very important tax years of the barisma money to expire. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=340.76s)]
*  Now, why would he appoint that individual, who also contradicted what he himself, Merrick [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=345.92s)]
*  Garland, said? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=353.12s)]
*  Merrick Garland said he had given the authority to Mr. Weiss to press charges in other jurisdictions. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=354.12s)]
*  Well, according to the whistleblowers, who took contemporaneous notes, they said David [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=360.6s)]
*  Weiss said just the opposite. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  So why would he be appointed unless somehow they're looking to protect the Bidens? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=366.6s)]
*  Well, that's why we need to have a special prosecutor who's above reproach. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=372.36s)]
*  My suggestion has been that a group of very distinguished people recommend five people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=376.6s)]
*  to Garland and tell him to pick from those five people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  Nobody from inside the Justice Department, nobody who's involved in politics, people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=386.24s)]
*  of the stature of Archibald Cox, who was the special prosecutor appointed in the Nixon [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  case, everybody believed that what we need to do is report credibility to our criminal [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=395.12s)]
*  justice system, not make our criminal justice system into a weaponized- [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  Let me crush you, though. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=404.0s)]
*  Can you explain, Professor, you're so, you're such a smart man and you're an honest man. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  Can you explain to this country tonight how it's possible that somebody that is admittedly [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=411.08s)]
*  addicted to drugs and alcohol, somebody that has no experience, is making millions of dollars [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=417.2s)]
*  from all of these countries, even our top number one geopolitical foe, why would they [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=423.44s)]
*  be paying him that kind of money if he has no experience? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=431.32s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you, Professor, because it doesn't make sense to me? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  It makes complete sense. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=440.8s)]
*  They wanted access to the president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=442.04s)]
*  It's called the American system of lobbying. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=443.8s)]
*  You pay people to give you access. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=446.3s)]
*  There's no doubt that he was not qualified to have any of these positions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=452.18s)]
*  But let's look at it legally. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=453.18s)]
*  Are they then paying for influence, and is that a crime, Professor? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  Well they're paying for influence. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=460.3s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=461.98s)]
*  It's a crime for the person paying for the influence. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=462.98s)]
*  Whether it's a crime for the person who was to be influenced, that's something that has [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=466.18s)]
*  to be looked into. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=470.54s)]
*  Okay, then let me crush you further. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=471.54s)]
*  When Joe Biden went against Obama policy on the billion in loan guarantees, and he leveraged [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=473.52s)]
*  it to get the prosecutor investigating Burisma fired in six hours after he had spoken with [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=479.32s)]
*  those executives five days earlier with his son when they were in Dubai together, and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=485.56s)]
*  in fact son of a bee, he got that guy fired, my question to you is, did he take an official [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=490.68s)]
*  action as vice president that resulted in a financial gain for his own son? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=496.44s)]
*  And if he did, what would you call that, Greg Jarrett I think called the bribery, if I'm [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=502.76s)]
*  wrong Greg, correct me. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=507.32s)]
*  Remember it's beyond the statute of limitations. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=509.8s)]
*  Now you don't have a statute of limitations in impeachment, but can you impeach a president [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=511.8s)]
*  who committed an impeachable offense while vice president? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=516.64s)]
*  That's an interesting issue. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=519.68s)]
*  What do you think, Greg Jarrett? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=520.68s)]
*  Well look, it's Burisma, as you have explained, is exhibited in bribery, 18 USC 201, and also [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=524.2s)]
*  under the impeachment clause in the Constitution, but there's far more than that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  Investigators have tracked at least 24 million from Beijing sent to Hunter, then funneled [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=539.36s)]
*  through this labyrinth of shell companies and eventually to his family members. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=545.84s)]
*  That figure is actually a fraction of the total cash haul, factor in millions from China, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  millions from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania, half a dozen other countries over which Joe [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=557.76s)]
*  Biden exerted influence. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=563.64s)]
*  You're probably closer to $50 million banked by the Bidens in these suspected influence [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=565.88s)]
*  peddling schemes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=572.6s)]
*  I think, frankly, you know, the committee has only spent a few months uncovering mountains [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=573.84s)]
*  of evidence, but it may just be the tip of the iceberg. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=580.72s)]
*  This may be the largest bribery influence peddling scandal in American political history [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=585.48s)]
*  and shameful. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=592.88s)]
*  Do you agree with that, Professor? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=593.88s)]
*  If the evidence supports what the investigations have shown by Greg, by John Solomon, and by [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=598.52s)]
*  you, there is a smoking gun here, and that's why we need a special prosecutor to look into [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=604.92s)]
*  this, because this may be a very, very significant matter, but we have to get the evidence. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=610.76s)]
*  It can't be based just on allegations, and it can't be based on partisan investigations. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  The American public deserves to have a person of great integrity and reputation look into [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=622.28s)]
*  these matters. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=627.92s)]
*  You know, Judge Nury. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=628.92s)]
*  I'm saying based on— [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=629.92s)]
*  But what we know now— [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=630.92s)]
*  Opening. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=631.92s)]
*  You admit this is influence peddling. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=632.92s)]
*  Based on what we know, the facts we know, the words of Joe Biden, the words of Hunter [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=634.48s)]
*  Biden. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=638.64s)]
*  I have no experience. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=639.64s)]
*  Son of a B, they fired him. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=640.64s)]
*  We know what the policy was. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=643.72s)]
*  We know when the phone calls took place. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=645.16s)]
*  Pretty damning, if you ask me, Professor, but I do appreciate you being with us. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLC0Ada4wc&t=647.64s)]
