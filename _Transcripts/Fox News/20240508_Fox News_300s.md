# Sean Hannity: Biden has no moral compass
**Fox News:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk)
*  We begin with a very serious story out of Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=0.0s)]
*  For the first time in American history, your spineless, your gutless, your cowardly president [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=4.84s)]
*  has now abandoned our closest ally in the Middle East in the greatest time, the greatest [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  hour of need. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=17.84s)]
*  Breaking tonight, Joe Biden says that he plans to cut off weapons to Israel if the world's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=19.48s)]
*  only Jewish state continues to fight back against the Hamas terrorists that are now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=25.68s)]
*  holding Israelis and American hostages. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=30.92s)]
*  Now, the same terrorists that raped, killed, tortured thousands of men, women and children, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=34.16s)]
*  burning babies alive in their cribs just a few months ago, the same terrorists that have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=40.08s)]
*  stated in their charter that they want Israel's complete destruction, Joe Biden's message [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=45.9s)]
*  to the entire world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=51.36s)]
*  American lives don't matter, our allies' lives, they don't matter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=53.28s)]
*  Joe doesn't have your back ever. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=57.0s)]
*  Just let the terrorists have their way and hope for the best. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Now, if radical, ignorant freaks on college campuses, and anti-Semitic and anti-American [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Islamic extremists, if they just yell loud enough, Joe, your president, will do whatever [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=69.08s)]
*  they want. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=74.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=75.48s)]
*  I made it clear that if they go into Ra'afah, they haven't gone into Ra'afah yet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  If they go into Ra'afah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=82.08s)]
*  to deal with Ra'afah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=87.0s)]
*  I've made it clear to Bibi in the War Cabinet they're not going to get our support if, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  in fact, they go into these population centers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=95.28s)]
*  We're not walking away from Israel's security, we're walking away from Israel's ability [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=97.48s)]
*  to wage war in those areas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=101.36s)]
*  So it's not over your red line yet? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=104.16s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  But it's—we've held up the weapons. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  We've held up the one shipment, as an old shipment, that has been designed for them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  We've held that up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  And all Joe said to Russia and Putin and Iran and the mullahs was, don't. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=120.48s)]
*  But this is what he's saying to Israel as they're defending themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Joe, they were the victims of the worst terror attack in their history. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=129.76s)]
*  Joe Biden has likely, frankly, just sealed the fate of every hostage that is now in captivity, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=133.84s)]
*  all for what? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  A few votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  He has no moral compass. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=143.92s)]
*  Your president has no moral clarity, no courage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Frankly, he has no decency. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=149.76s)]
*  And he has a brain that is barely functioning and can't distinguish what? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  Right from wrong, good from evil. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  He's now impotent, cowardly when it comes to standing for the cause of liberty and freedom [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=158.48s)]
*  over radical terrorists? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=164.04s)]
*  Ten years ago, Obama's defense secretary, you might recall, Robert Gates, said, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=166.48s)]
*  Biden has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=170.48s)]
*  over the past four decades. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=175.56s)]
*  Well, Robert Gates was right then and he's right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=177.88s)]
*  And now America and the world is in serious danger. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=181.28s)]
*  Our allies see what Joe Biden is doing to Israel and they all know they can no longer [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  trust the United States. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=190.36s)]
*  And look at the national security disaster, for example, that he's created right here [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=192.84s)]
*  at home. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=196.68s)]
*  And it's our country at risk. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=197.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=199.88s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden's open borders, allowing unvetted, illegal immigrants from the hostile [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=200.88s)]
*  enemy countries. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's see, China, Russia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=208.6s)]
*  Joe has created what is a clear and present danger to every one of your, you and your [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=215.16s)]
*  family's security and your safety. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  The world is less safe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=224.16s)]
*  Our country is less safe because Joe Biden is your president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=225.84s)]
*  All of this comes amidst spiking inflation, unaffordable housing, violent crime, levels [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=230.68s)]
*  that are through the roof, multiple wars overseas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=236.76s)]
*  And now the president surrenders to the radical mob that controls his party and has surrendered [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=240.32s)]
*  in terms of fighting the war against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=246.44s)]
*  He's chosen to abandon America's role as the leader of the free world and is now emboldening [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=250.68s)]
*  these Islamic radicals worldwide. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=257.0s)]
*  He is the Neville Chamberlain of our time, a president that only the mullahs of Iran [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=260.68s)]
*  could be proud of. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=265.96s)]
*  The consequences right now are incalculable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=267.6s)]
*  In the end, this is a sad day for America, a moral failing of a magnitude we can't even [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=271.4s)]
*  begin to calculate. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=278.24s)]
*  And mark my words, these actions will have dire consequences for this country and for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=279.96s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=286.68s)]
*  Because you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AxGLN3REk&t=295.88s)]
