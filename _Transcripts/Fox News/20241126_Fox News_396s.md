# Kamala Harris is 'cooked' on the national political scene: Charlie Hurt
**Fox News:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano)
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt and America's next ambassador to Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=5.4s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=6.4s)]
*  Ambassador to be, I hope, Mike Huckabee. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=7.4s)]
*  Congratulations again. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=9.56s)]
*  You know, I became very close friends with somebody that I know you know, Alice Marie [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=11.36s)]
*  Johnson, and love her dearly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=16.0s)]
*  And oh, this was the woman, one-time drug offender. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=18.88s)]
*  Donald Trump either commuted or pardoned her, whatever, commuted the sentence. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=23.48s)]
*  And I'll never forget that moment where she went running out into the arms of her family. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=28.52s)]
*  She never thought she'd get out of prison. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=33.32s)]
*  So she started her own ministry there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=35.64s)]
*  And she would help young girls that were getting out and help them, you know, guide them to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=38.6s)]
*  get them on the right road. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=42.88s)]
*  I would like to see the transformation of the use of the presidential pardon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=44.96s)]
*  Maybe it's a Hannity idea that people like. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=49.34s)]
*  I like it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=52.08s)]
*  Let Alice Marie Johnson find every person in jail that doesn't belong there and say [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=53.44s)]
*  once a week, Donald Trump makes an announcement, I'm going to pardon this person or that person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=59.4s)]
*  What are your thoughts and what do you think Joe should do with Hunter? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=65.08s)]
*  Politically, it's a disaster because nobody ever supports any commutation or clemency [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=69.72s)]
*  action, whether it's a governor or president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=76.16s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=78.12s)]
*  They will say they will, but they don't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  The truth is, Donald Trump showed a level of courage that very few presidents have ever [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=81.68s)]
*  shown. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=85.64s)]
*  He didn't wait till his last day and let go with a lot of his buddies and friends that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  were in the clink. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=91.04s)]
*  What he did was create an incredibly powerful program called First Step that recognized [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=92.48s)]
*  that some people don't need to be in prison anymore. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=99.48s)]
*  It's a very expensive process. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=102.28s)]
*  And so he created a program that looked at sentences, some that were way too long, and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=104.4s)]
*  he actually started giving people what every person in prison needs to keep from just becoming [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=109.64s)]
*  unglued, and that's hope. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=115.88s)]
*  Donald Trump did something that defied political gravity in that, and thank God for it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=117.88s)]
*  What do you think about Hunter and Joe? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=123.0s)]
*  And then we'll ask about what Trump should do if Joe doesn't pardon his son or commute [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=124.52s)]
*  a sentence. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=129.08s)]
*  You know, I would hope that he looks at the facts, and if there's something that is untoward [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=131.04s)]
*  in the sentence, then sure, consider it, but don't do it just as a symbolic measure. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=138.2s)]
*  There are a lot of people who have been in prison since the January 6th convictions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=144.72s)]
*  Some of them deserve to be there because they committed crimes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=149.16s)]
*  They struck a police officer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=152.2s)]
*  They vandalized government property. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=153.68s)]
*  They threatened people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=156.04s)]
*  That's different. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=157.4s)]
*  But there were people who just walked around that day, and within months, they had the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=158.4s)]
*  FBI banging on their door. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=162.64s)]
*  They went to trial. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=164.84s)]
*  Some of them were put in jail for months on end without any type of adjudication, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=166.36s)]
*  there are people that have no business having a felony conviction as a result of simply [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=172.08s)]
*  walking around at the invitation of the Capitol Police. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  And there are some people who are in prison, not just for that, but other things, that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  really are serving no particular purpose for remaining in there and having a felony conviction. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  Charlie, do you like my Alice Marie Johnson idea, pardon a week, find people in jail [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  that have either served their time or are deserving to get out? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And what do you think that Joe Biden should and will do regarding his son? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And if he doesn't do anything for his son, should Donald Trump consider it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=207.04s)]
*  Well, of course, I always love—all Americans love redemption stories. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=211.12s)]
*  They love stories about people who get a second chance and do something great with it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it's a marvelous idea. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, there are—you've run into all kinds of problems doing that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  But if you were to do it in a cautious, sensible way, I think it would be—like I say, I think [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=229.56s)]
*  Americans love stories like that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=237.68s)]
*  I think it could be very inspiring. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=240.32s)]
*  In terms of—obviously, commuting or removing Hunter Biden's sentence is not something—it's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=242.56s)]
*  not fair. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=252.16s)]
*  It's not just. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=253.16s)]
*  But in a lot of ways, I kind of would be surprised if Joe Biden doesn't do that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=254.52s)]
*  There would be no incentive for Donald Trump to do that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=259.28s)]
*  And I feel like in a lot of ways, Joe Biden—everything that Hunter Biden has made of his life has [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=263.88s)]
*  been sort of in service of his father. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=270.24s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, I kind of feel like his father is almost—I mean, you think about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  what he used his son for, running him as a bag man for the family's influence-peddling [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  scam all these years. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  You know, it's sort of—I wouldn't commute the guy's sentence. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=285.48s)]
*  I wouldn't pardon him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=290.12s)]
*  But I certainly think that his father is probably just as, if not more, guilty than Hunter Biden [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=291.6s)]
*  is for a lot of the jams that he's gotten himself—legal jams that he's gotten himself [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=297.6s)]
*  into. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, if Republicans were like Democrats, they would, you know, weaponize the justice [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  system and go after Joe after he leaves office. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=307.88s)]
*  Let me ask you both. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  I have about 40 seconds for each of you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you think of the idea of a Kamala comeback, Governor Huckabee? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=314.72s)]
*  Or do you think she would run for governor? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't you think that Gavin Newsom has in the back of his head he wants to be in that Oval [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Office? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=327.72s)]
*  The problem is, he has the same policies he supports as Kamala. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=328.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, it would be a gift to the Republicans, and I hope she runs for something, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=332.76s)]
*  because it's just really wonderful. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=338.2s)]
*  Maybe she'll get another billion dollars and blow through that like she did her presidential [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=340.08s)]
*  campaign. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=343.76s)]
*  But the difference is— [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=344.76s)]
*  Oh, she can win governor. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=345.76s)]
*  Nobody's going to hand her the nomination. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=346.76s)]
*  She's—yeah, but she's going to have to run, even if for governor, and she's not going [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=347.76s)]
*  to get a free ride all the way to the nomination without having some competition. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=352.6s)]
*  Not this time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=356.44s)]
*  So good luck, Kamala. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=357.44s)]
*  I hope it works out for you, because I think most every Republican will love to face you [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=358.44s)]
*  again. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Real quick, Charlie, does she have a future? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  On the national political scene, she's cooked. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  She's finished. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  She'll never come back. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  She can waste her time and waste people's money by trying, but she's finished. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Whether or not she could do it in California, I don't know, but the problem is every time [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=377.16s)]
*  the more people learn about her, the more people don't like her. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=380.96s)]
*  And I think that would apply if she runs in California, but it's definitely true if she [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=383.8s)]
*  ever tries to run nationally again. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=388.32s)]
*  All right, Charlie, thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=390.12s)]
*  Governor, hopefully Ambassador Roossoon. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=392.88s)]
*  Huckabee, thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1Hln74Ano&t=395.28s)]
