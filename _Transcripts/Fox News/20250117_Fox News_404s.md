# Newsom's policies have 'destroyed' California: Patrick Bet-David
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA)
*  The speaker, he is correct. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=0.0s)]
*  Any aid has got to insist that the science of forestry be implemented so you, the American [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=2.48s)]
*  people, you don't have to keep bailing people out. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=8.92s)]
*  These are predictable Santa Ana winds. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=11.96s)]
*  They're predictable wildfires. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=14.08s)]
*  They've got to clear out the brush and do things like, oh, control burns and maybe not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=15.36s)]
*  put a little shrub above the safety of people's lifeblood, their home. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=22.16s)]
*  Host, Patrick, Bette, David highlighted the cost of construction came up with five possible [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=28.0s)]
*  solutions that the governor, the state, could use to pay for it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=33.84s)]
*  He could ask Trump and taxpayers for help. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=38.14s)]
*  He could raise California's already high taxes even more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=40.78s)]
*  He can tax the California billionaires. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=44.44s)]
*  We hear about that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Chase them out of California even more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Blame and deflect, which he's already done, or frankly resign, which is never going to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=54.04s)]
*  He's the host of the PBD podcast founder of Value Attainment Media Group. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=55.04s)]
*  Patrick Bette David is with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=60.28s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=62.44s)]
*  You're a part owner of the New York Yankees. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=63.72s)]
*  How did you pull that off? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=65.96s)]
*  Sean, it's great to be on with you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=67.64s)]
*  One day I get a call from a man named Bob saying, I hear you're interested in being [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  an owner of the Yankees. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=75.98s)]
*  I said, yes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=77.2s)]
*  A year and a half later, all the background check, everything that happened, I became [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=78.2s)]
*  a minority owner, which was a very special day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=81.44s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  They never called me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  I would have been very interested if I could get even a half a share. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, thanks for being with us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Look, to me, this is simple. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=92.48s)]
*  Basic forestry, science, management, clear brush, fire retardant, building materials, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=95.36s)]
*  control burns, you know, put the lives and the homes of people above a plant. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=111.04s)]
*  Why aren't they doing that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  So, Sean, bad policies have consequences. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  We saw this during COVID. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=118.36s)]
*  When California came up with all these policies, and I lived there for 24 years, you started [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  seeing a mass exodus, first time since 1851, where the net migration was a negative in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=124.48s)]
*  California. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=130.76s)]
*  If you look at the numbers from July 2020 till April of 2024, the number one state with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=131.76s)]
*  negative migration, net negative migration, is the state of California. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=137.96s)]
*  1.234 million people left the state due to COVID policies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=142.56s)]
*  Now, those folks left because they were sick of their kids not going to school, they were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=147.0s)]
*  sick of not having a life, they wanted to go out there, go to a restaurant, maybe they [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=150.84s)]
*  moved to Texas, maybe they moved to Florida. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=154.24s)]
*  But the exodus we're about to see, Governor Newsom calls it Los Angeles 2.0, I call it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  California Exodus 2.0. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=161.84s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=163.68s)]
*  The average age of somebody that lives in L.A. is 37 years old. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=164.68s)]
*  Think about when you and I were 37 years old, what life events was taking place. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=169.0s)]
*  Maybe you're having a kid or you're second one, you're buying a house or you're second [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=173.04s)]
*  one, thinking about starting a business, thinking about a career change. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=176.56s)]
*  So let's process this together. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  You sit there, if you choose to buy a house in California, you have to ask yourself this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  question. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Do the current leaders of California come out with the policies, protect you from a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  future earthquake, protect you from a future fire, protect you from preventing insurance [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=191.66s)]
*  companies, prices of going up, do you believe that's going to happen? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=196.92s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Number two, if you choose to build a house and you want to rebuild, how long do you think [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  it's going to take to get those permits? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=205.2s)]
*  Probably 12, 24, 36 months. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Number three, if you choose to have kids, why would you raise your kids in the school [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  system of California? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  No matter what part of California you're in, why would you do that so you don't trust [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  the system? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=217.56s)]
*  Number four, if you choose to start a small business in California, do you think they've [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=218.56s)]
*  cleaned the homelessness? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=222.48s)]
*  They got $24 billion of taxpayer money and homelessness just went up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=223.48s)]
*  In America, we have 770,000 of homeless people in America. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  181 of it is in California. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=233.28s)]
*  This man has been the governor for six years, the lieutenant governor prior to that for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  eight years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  His policies have destroyed a once great state. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=242.0s)]
*  This is why— [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  You saw that tweet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  All right, so— [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  We have hydrants that don't work. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=251.44s)]
*  We have empty reservoirs. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=253.72s)]
*  We find out $650 million allocated to make the Port of L.A. green. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  We found out that the state—you know, that they have $2.6 billion allocated for firefighting, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=263.04s)]
*  but they—but $101 million was cut from that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=270.72s)]
*  We know that the city of Los Angeles cut money. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=277.08s)]
*  We know that they're spending $100 billion on electric vehicles. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  We know that the city of Los Angeles is spending $800 grand on electric street sweepers, but [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=285.0s)]
*  they're cutting the fire department budget. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  How do you fix stupid? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=294.68s)]
*  Because it's all stupid and it's all preventable. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=296.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, you saw the exchange with Mayor Bass where she went up there and she said, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=298.6s)]
*  well, I'll never—as a mayor, I'll never leave the states. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=305.56s)]
*  I'll never go abroad. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=308.6s)]
*  You left five times. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=309.68s)]
*  The leaders are not leading that state, but think about it this way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  The Palisades, you look at all the fires, 80,000 acres, 24 death toll that we know about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=314.44s)]
*  right now, all the homes, $250 billion of damages today, Reservoir Santa Inez, 117 million [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  gallons of water it can have. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=328.88s)]
*  Since February of last year, it's been zero. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=330.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  Because there was a hole in the cover that they had. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  That was one mile away from the fire that took place. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=336.92s)]
*  We can look at so many different angles, Sean. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=339.84s)]
*  It's just bad policies. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=342.48s)]
*  And they sit there thinking people are not going to be leaving. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=343.84s)]
*  The next phase of people leaving, maybe Hollywood doesn't leave. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=346.28s)]
*  Maybe the boomers in California that have lived there for a while don't leave. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=349.5s)]
*  Maybe some of the folks that are sitting there that have family ties, restaurants, businesses [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  don't leave. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=355.92s)]
*  But that 35 to 45 year old that knows the next 20 years are going to be the best money [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=356.96s)]
*  making gears of their careers, they're looking at Nevada, they're looking at Texas, and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=361.5s)]
*  they're looking at Florida. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=365.32s)]
*  And I can't blame them for looking at any one of those. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=367.32s)]
*  But I will tell you, they don't get a penny unless they adopt the science of forestry [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  so that the American taxpayer won't have to give one more penny to California. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=374.68s)]
*  Frankly, in many ways, they should have to fix this themselves. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  They elected these people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=382.84s)]
*  They wanted these environmental radicals in office, and this is what they got. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=384.76s)]
*  And sadly, I bet they elect Kamala next. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=388.52s)]
*  That's pathetic. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlRh88mnAMA&t=391.12s)]
