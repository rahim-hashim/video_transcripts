# Joe Concha: This is a ‘teleprompter candidacy’
**Fox News:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs)
*  Anyway, here with reaction, the author of the big new bestselling book, progressively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=0.0s)]
*  worse, Why Today's Democrats Ate Your Daddy's Dunkies, Fox News contributor, media analyst [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=5.44s)]
*  Joe Concha, along with Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, former White House chief of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=11.32s)]
*  staff Reince Priebus. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=15.64s)]
*  All right, Joe, congrats on the books. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=16.84s)]
*  We'll start with—a book. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=19.16s)]
*  We'll start with you tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=20.16s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot to unpack here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=21.16s)]
*  Donald Trump was there for an hour, what, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever it was today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=24.0s)]
*  No problem answering questions, question after question after question. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=28.56s)]
*  Jaydee Vance has been answering questions almost every day, and she goes into the witness [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  protection program, and the media doesn't care, just like they didn't care and they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  protected Joe in his basement all throughout the 2020 campaign. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=42.46s)]
*  By my count, Sean, Donald Trump took 42 questions during this press conference. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=48.04s)]
*  That's exactly 42 more questions than Kamala Harris has taken in since Joe Biden was bullied [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=52.92s)]
*  out of running again 19 days ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=58.58s)]
*  Here's a fun stat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=61.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris has not held a single solo press conference on domestic soil in five-plus years [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=63.14s)]
*  since she announced she was running for president back in 2019. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=69.54s)]
*  She hasn't earned a single vote, despite when she ran in 2019-2020. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=73.18s)]
*  I guess she didn't get to 2020, and obviously now is a Democratic nominee in 2024. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=77.86s)]
*  And by the way, Trump's strategy here was a masterstroke regarding the debates, because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=82.1s)]
*  in the modern political era, it has been traditional that the general election candidates hold [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=87.22s)]
*  three presidential debates. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=92.42s)]
*  So given the precedent, Kamala Harris must agree to the three debates Trump agreed to. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=94.9s)]
*  But she won't, and now, as you reported earlier, she needs more than what, three weeks to prepare [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=100.12s)]
*  for a friendly interview on The View or MSNBC? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=104.98s)]
*  That'll be like T-ball if you put a beach ball on the T. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=108.58s)]
*  So Kamala Harris, all sizzle, no steak, all foam, no beer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=112.26s)]
*  This is the teleprompter candidacy with Kamala and with Tim Walz for that matter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=117.04s)]
*  But the momentum is changing, by the way. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  The sugar high is ending, the jig is up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=123.18s)]
*  We already see two polls out today, Trump up by five and Rasmussen up a few points and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  a CNBC poll, despite Kamala Harris getting the most favorable coverage in the history [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=129.94s)]
*  of presidential candidates, Sean. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  And I would believe that Wisconsin is a winnable state, Reince Priebus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=137.96s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=142.12s)]
*  But look, you know, you're all right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=144.52s)]
*  The strategy of Harris is to do nothing and let the media recreate this Barack Obama-style [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=147.22s)]
*  election. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=153.36s)]
*  And you talked about diving and ducking, and it's like dodgeball. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=154.36s)]
*  But you know, you can get pretty far in dodgeball as long as you don't get hit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  So if you don't get hit, you can keep going. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=163.84s)]
*  And that's why I think we got to go back to the basics, which is what brought Trump here [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=166.76s)]
*  in the first place before that first debate, which is what? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=170.64s)]
*  It was inflation, it was the economy, it was the border. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=173.88s)]
*  And Donald Trump said it so many times during the debate, it's gas, groceries and the things [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=177.12s)]
*  that are affecting the family. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  So that record that you put on the screen in the monologue is the blueprint to winning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=182.92s)]
*  here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=189.0s)]
*  And Walz is no different in Minnesota. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=190.0s)]
*  Women in sports giving away their entire surplus for 20 weeks off of work. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=191.76s)]
*  I mean, this is Joe is right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=197.92s)]
*  This is so winnable. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=200.88s)]
*  So that's the first thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=201.88s)]
*  The second thing is it's going to come down to this boring thing called the ground game, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=202.88s)]
*  which is thousands of people on the ground in Wisconsin attacking early vote, absentee [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  ballot voting one by one, 10 hours a day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  The voting starts in mid-September. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  This thing is cooking up in a month and a week from now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  It's coming down to this razor thin majority. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=222.28s)]
*  We can win it, but it's coming down to the basics in that boring thing called the ground [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=225.08s)]
*  game. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me follow up and then we'll go to Charlie. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  You were one of the most successful RNC chairs in history. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=233.96s)]
*  You understand this game as well as anybody. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=236.96s)]
*  Where do you see where the Republicans are now? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  The president's campaign is now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Compare it to 2020. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=243.96s)]
*  Compare it to 2016. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=245.8s)]
*  Have Republicans? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  Do they have a strong enough ground game? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=250.56s)]
*  Do they have enough attorneys at the ready? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  Are they really pushing early voting, voting by mail, legal ballot harvesting and these issues? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=256.18s)]
*  Hey, I've done a lot of work over the last few days trying to get to some answers on [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  this and they are. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=270.38s)]
*  They've got hundreds of people out there on the ground. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=272.02s)]
*  They're going to employ thousands of people paid door to door. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=275.1s)]
*  The sophistication is getting better and better and the Trump campaign is so well funded. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=280.82s)]
*  They can put $20 million on the ground in these battleground states and attack these [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=285.5s)]
*  votes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=291.66s)]
*  But look, early voting, absentee ballot voting has grown phenomenally over the last four [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=292.66s)]
*  to eight years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=298.82s)]
*  So this is going to take a tripling down of this effort on the ground. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=299.82s)]
*  I think that they're up to it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=304.14s)]
*  I think that they're ready for it, but it's going to come down to execution. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  We're going to find out in a month and a week whether it's working. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=309.42s)]
*  Charlie, let me ask you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=312.22s)]
*  I agree with Joe about the honeymoon, the sugar high, those are terms I myself have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=314.62s)]
*  used. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=318.58s)]
*  However, they're going into their convention. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=320.18s)]
*  Usually there's a convention bounce after that reality at some point is going to set [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=323.98s)]
*  in here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=328.86s)]
*  The one problem that I also see that Republicans have is that they have a corrupt media that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=330.38s)]
*  is basically complicit and nothing but an extension of the Harris-Walls campaign. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  So they've got to bypass that and they've got to inform the American people how radical, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  extreme and frankly dangerous these policies are. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know if it's actually an extension of the Harris-Walls campaign [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  and rather it's just sort of the campaign because I don't think that they're necessarily [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  getting any direction from Harris-Walls there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=366.22s)]
*  I don't think that they're, I think they really are hunkered down. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=368.94000000000005s)]
*  They don't want to explain anything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=371.66s)]
*  They have obviously, Kamala Harris has changed their positions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  There's got to be coordination. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=379.3s)]
*  Has to be. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm sure there is to some degree, but the media is all too happy to carry whatever water [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=383.5s)]
*  they need to cover for Kamala Harris and to cover for Democrats. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=389.54s)]
*  Part of that is because they so despise Donald Trump because Donald Trump is such a threat [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=393.9s)]
*  to the system. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=397.18s)]
*  But either way, she's going to play this entire thing where she hides out and she doesn't [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=398.18s)]
*  ever explain anything. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=405.14s)]
*  The fact that she doesn't have any issues on her website is absolutely shocking, but [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=406.5s)]
*  she does think that she can get away with it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=410.74s)]
*  And that's why what I think is so important is to keep running all of the clips from the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  past of her cackling, of her talking about all of these crazy things, about how much [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=418.7s)]
*  more woke everybody needs to be and how we need to have reparations. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=423.26s)]
*  Run all those things because eventually at some point, if that's all the footage that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=427.74s)]
*  we can run of her demonstrating her positions on these things, at some point she's going [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=432.3s)]
*  to get smoked out and she's going to have to do, answer some questions, and she's going [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=437.38s)]
*  to have to debate. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=441.94s)]
*  And when that happens, I think that's going to be the end of her campaign. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=443.42s)]
*  I don't think, except for Brett and Martha, I don't think anybody in the media would actually [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=448.42s)]
*  ask the questions. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=453.1s)]
*  But Joe, Contra, you know the media, this is your area of expertise. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=454.22s)]
*  Do you believe that this will get into the bloodstream of American culture? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=458.82s)]
*  Will every American voter know the radical record of both of them before they vote? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=463.98s)]
*  Early voting starts in 40 days. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=468.58s)]
*  Wow, 40 days. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=471.38s)]
*  I think, Sean, social media is an equalizer to a certain extent as far as YouTube and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=473.62s)]
*  X and all these places where these clips are going viral, as far as Kamala Harris opposing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=478.22s)]
*  domestic energy like fracking and fossil fuels, opposes ICE, border walls, remain in Mexico [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=483.22s)]
*  policy, supports sanctuary cities, supports sex changes for minors without parental permission, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=488.62s)]
*  supports raising taxes, supports allowing violent felons to vote from jail, all while [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=495.14s)]
*  expanding the Supreme Court, ending the filibuster. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=499.9s)]
*  And another, by the way, if this is a number one issue as far as the economy is concerned, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=503.09999999999997s)]
*  ask this question. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=508.82s)]
*  What business experience does Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have exactly? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=510.02s)]
*  Because the answer is zero. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=514.1s)]
*  That's kind of a big deal. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=515.66s)]
*  And that's something that Donald Trump should be hammering home. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=516.78s)]
*  And oh, by the way, there is no teleprompter in this situation room. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=518.78s)]
*  So picture Kamala Harris as commander in chief, Sean. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=523.34s)]
*  Know this. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=526.02s)]
*  If this Democratic ticket wins, you will not recognize this country. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=527.02s)]
*  That I know. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=530.18s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=531.18s)]
*  I don't know anything Reince about super PACs, PACs, hard money, soft money. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=533.02s)]
*  That's your area of expertise. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=537.86s)]
*  However, with 40 days until early voting, don't ads need to get up sooner than later? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they need to get up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=547.06s)]
*  But really, how this goes, everybody, is when you're dealing with you get billions of dollars [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=549.1s)]
*  that you're spending in about five states. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=553.98s)]
*  These campaigns, this campaign knows what beer you drink, what car you drive, how many [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=556.86s)]
*  kids you have, how much money you make. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=560.58s)]
*  They know where you work. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=562.2600000000001s)]
*  So if you work in an energy sector, they're going to know if you're in Pennsylvania and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=563.38s)]
*  you're running against Kamala Harris and she wants to shut down gas and energy, they're [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=566.86s)]
*  going to know about it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=570.94s)]
*  So this is like slicing and dicing 50,000 people out of 7 million in a particular state. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  This is why the detail of this is so important, why it's so important to have thousands of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=579.86s)]
*  people paid on the ground to make this happen. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=584.98s)]
*  I think that's great advice. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=588.62s)]
*  Charlie, can they pull that off? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=589.9s)]
*  I think they can and they're going to have to fight it every single day because as you [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=593.46s)]
*  point out, the media is going to be against them, I think even more strongly than the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=598.22s)]
*  Harris campaign. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  I'd say take the gloves off now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=607.54s)]
*  Don't wait until early voting has already begun. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=610.18s)]
*  Alright, thank you all. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=612.86s)]
*  Appreciate your time tonight. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cENPhMbBs&t=614.2199999999999s)]
