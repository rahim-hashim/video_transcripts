# These are embarrassing polls for Biden: Patrick Bet-David
**Fox News:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA)
*  Valuetainment founder Patrick Bette-David joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=0.0s)]
*  The old switcheroo, are you feeling that theory? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=4.68s)]
*  You know, first of all, happy Memorial Day to all the servicemen around the country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=11.08s)]
*  But I'm going to tell you this, listen, in business and in life, it comes down to four [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=14.92s)]
*  things. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=18.48s)]
*  Whoever outworks, out improves, out strategizes and outlasts wins. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=19.48s)]
*  Let's take a look at this between Biden and Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Trump outworking. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=27.32s)]
*  He gets one day a week to campaign. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=28.32s)]
*  Wednesdays. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=30.52s)]
*  His opponent has seven days, right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=31.52s)]
*  One on seven. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=34.04s)]
*  That's like a quarterback that gets 70 attempts, Joe Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=35.04s)]
*  A quarterback only gets 10 attempts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  The guy with throwing 10 attempts gets 10 touchdowns. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=40.24s)]
*  The other guy cannot get a single touchdown. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=42.88s)]
*  So he got outworked. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=45.8s)]
*  He's outimproven because if you notice, 2020, President Trump seemed a little bit upset. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=46.8s)]
*  His campaign was, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=51.32s)]
*  2024, it's optimism, unification. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=54.08s)]
*  Greatest country in the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=57.2s)]
*  We got to make a comeback. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=58.28s)]
*  Messaging has improved. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=59.28s)]
*  Uplifting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=60.64s)]
*  You want to be around the guy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=61.64s)]
*  He seems optimistic even though they're doing all the stuff to him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=62.88s)]
*  Outworked, outimproved, outstrategized. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=66.44s)]
*  This guy's got the audacity to go to New York in AOC's county, campaign and shake hands [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  with people, 5, 10, 15, 25,000 people show up. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=73.16s)]
*  You're willing to tell me you have the audacity to come to my city, New York, even though [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=77.04s)]
*  the campaign manager for Biden today that showed up, I don't know if you saw him, one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=80.68s)]
*  of the very famous campaign managers, Vito Corleone, showed up today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=84.4s)]
*  And he had to analyze this to see if he can kind of change it up, aka Robert De Niro. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=87.8s)]
*  And last but not least, outlast, it's his biggest strength. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Good luck outlasting him when it comes to campaigning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=95.6s)]
*  There's no way President Biden can do that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=100.72s)]
*  He's out hustling him in all four of those factors. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=101.72s)]
*  But Joe's got the establishment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=103.52s)]
*  He's got the CIA telling the prosecutors to back off his son's sugar brother. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=105.84s)]
*  He's got Alvin Bragg doing his dirty work. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  He's got Jack Smith. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=113.64s)]
*  He's got Latisha James and Fannie and the crew down in Atlanta. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=114.76s)]
*  And he's got the media who Joe can't do anything wrong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=119.4s)]
*  He can lie and they say it's fine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  He can fall asleep at a Memorial Day event and they say, oh no, that's fake news. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=124.76s)]
*  Is that going to be enough to help him go across the finish line again? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  I think he's going to need manipulation and gamesmanship and trying to find a different [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  you look at the polls right now, a couple embarrassing polls for Biden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=141.8s)]
*  New York in 2020, you win by 23 points, 61 to 38. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Right now, New York, he's only got a nine point lead. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a Seattle poll, by the way. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=155.28s)]
*  You look at blacks voting in 2020, they won 22 percent, 9 percent is what Trump got with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=157.0s)]
*  the black votes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=163.52s)]
*  Ninety one percent pretty much went to the other side. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=164.52s)]
*  Trump's got 22 percent now on climbing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=167.08s)]
*  He's winning the business owners. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=169.56s)]
*  He's winning the workers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=171.16s)]
*  He's winning the black vote. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=172.8s)]
*  He's winning the young vote. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=174.08s)]
*  He's winning the people in the middle libertarian vote. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=175.72s)]
*  You go to their convention, it starts off booing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=178.36s)]
*  You don't give up and it ends with cheering. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=181.48s)]
*  I mean, this is how you go into these types of moments to be able to win. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=183.12s)]
*  He's doing it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=186.52s)]
*  The only thing I would only think I always say, stay paranoid. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=187.52s)]
*  You want him to run. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=190.68s)]
*  You want Biden to be the candidate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=191.72s)]
*  You don't want him to bring anybody else, but only the paranoid survive. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=193.32s)]
*  They're not going to lose these this easily. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=196.4s)]
*  Only the paranoid survive. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=199.28s)]
*  I haven't heard that one, but that's a good one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=201.48s)]
*  I'll have to write that down. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=203.2s)]
*  And remember, Biden's only up nine in New York and guess who just qualified to get on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=204.2s)]
*  the ballot? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=208.84s)]
*  RFK Jr. here in New York. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCQceh6ZwA&t=209.84s)]
