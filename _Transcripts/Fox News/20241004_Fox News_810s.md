# Hannity: The Biden admin has been ‘tone deaf’ to Hurricane Helene disaster
**Fox News:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight recovery efforts. They continue in parts of North Carolina, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=0.0s)]
*  South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and Florida. We have communities all across [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=4.88s)]
*  Appalachia. They are completely devastated. The situation tonight is dire. And according to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=10.32s)]
*  reports on the ground, the Biden administration, they have been making it worse and they have been [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=16.64s)]
*  totally tone deaf for over a week. This has been the worst federal hurricane response in the history [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=22.0s)]
*  of our country. On X, Elon Musk, who's been extremely generous and helpful to people in terms [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=28.24s)]
*  of restoring communications, he said, FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=34.8s)]
*  but they're actively blocking citizens who do try to help. He detailed the claim from a SpaceX [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=40.8s)]
*  engineer on the ground who's accusing FEMA of blocking shipments of Elon's emergency Starlink [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  terminals, which Donald Trump asked him to send and he generously sent. This is soulless. It is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=55.12s)]
*  unconscionable. It is unforgivable. But in a statement, FEMA just frankly outright denied the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=61.44s)]
*  allegation and promoted their coordination with Starlink during various natural disasters. Well, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=67.6s)]
*  apparently the message didn't get to the owner of Starlink because that name is Elon Musk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=73.6s)]
*  And meanwhile, in a letter issued to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=78.24s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida details claims from government whistleblowers that, quote, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=82.96s)]
*  FEMA has wasted taxpayer funds, misappropriated funds, left other federal, state and local [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=88.08s)]
*  responders without deployment orders on the ground. The letter continues, quote, hundreds, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=94.16s)]
*  if not thousands of service members were deployed by the Department of Defense to North Carolina [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  and they have sat idle waiting for FEMA. We have confirmed FEMA employees deployed on the clock [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=105.36s)]
*  awaiting orders are in hotels when people may, their very lives may be at risk even a week plus [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=112.8s)]
*  later. Now, FEMA pre-disaster aid was withheld, exacerbating the emergency, it goes on. It has [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  been a full week plus already. Don't forget, we only found out yesterday, a week after the hurricane, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=128.48s)]
*  that according to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, he said it. He came out with the truth. I don't know where [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=136.16s)]
*  it came from, a miracle, that FEMA is almost out of money and has been slow to distribute hurricane [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=141.44s)]
*  relief funds, even though it's been a very slow hurricane season. And now we know the reason why, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=148.88s)]
*  which every American should be infuriated about. Biden and Harris rated FEMA's budget, they spent [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=155.52s)]
*  a billion plus dollars on housing, food, education, healthcare, sex change operations, debit cards, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=161.76s)]
*  expensive hotels all over the country for Harris and Joe Biden's 11.5 million plus [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=170.32s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants. Many coming from countries were terrorized, many from our top [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=177.12s)]
*  geopolitical foes, and we know there are known terrorists in this country. We know that dozens [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=182.88s)]
*  of Americans have been murdered by their unvetted illegal immigrants, dozens have been raped, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=188.56s)]
*  even children. We know that there are hundreds of victims of violent crime by Harris Biden [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=193.52s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants. We know all of that is true, and it's cost this country billions, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  and we don't have money for the people of North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=205.44s)]
*  and Florida. Here's the cold hard truth. Biden and Harris have prioritized their obsession of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=210.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants over all of you, the American people, all the people in North Carolina, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=219.52s)]
*  South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida. They've gotten almost nothing. So far, a one-time [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=225.68s)]
*  $750 payment, although they've only distributed about 4 million of that as of yesterday, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  and a promise maybe more money down the road if FEMA can find the cash, which they don't have as [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=238.24s)]
*  of now because they gave it away to Harris Biden illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Kamala totally [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=244.4s)]
*  tone deaf. Even a Hollywood fundraiser took precedence over hurricane victims. Joe sat at his, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=250.08s)]
*  you know, backside on a beach chair. This is why it's Kamala's Katrina. She's the borders are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=255.52s)]
*  That money came from FEMA, went right to her illegal immigrants that she said weren't here, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  that the border is secure and the border is closed. The president, well, he's totally checked out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=266.88s)]
*  You don't believe me? You decide. What are the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=272.8s)]
*  Say? What are the states in the storm zone? What do they need after what you saw today? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, in the storm zone? Yes, sir. I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=284.48s)]
*  They're getting everything they need and they're very happy across the board. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  What storm zone? They've got everything they need? They need? No, they don't. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=296.48s)]
*  We're now more than eight days after the hurricane made landfall. Victims in all of these states [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=302.24s)]
*  are not getting anything near what they need. We still haven't found all the people that are in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=308.88s)]
*  need. Joe Biden has no clue what he's talking about. Kamala is checked out. She's just happy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=314.24s)]
*  her illegal immigrants are being taken care of. Got to make sure they get their money for their [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=320.8s)]
*  sex change operations. And now the president is at the White House. And earlier today, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=325.44s)]
*  laughing it up, you know, just just having a good old time with the press corps. Take a look. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=330.32s)]
*  Do you reconsider dropping out of the race? I'm back in. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=336.48s)]
*  Now, many Americans are still without power across huge areas of Appalachia. No internet, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  no self-service. If they do have internet and self-service, you can thank Elon Musk, not them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=350.72s)]
*  In other words, those that have a way to communicate, it's not because of any help [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=356.08s)]
*  of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Remember, they revoked Elon Musk's winning bid to install Star [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=360.08s)]
*  Link service to the area a year ago. It would have provided that service for almost a million people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  Clean water, that's also in short supply. Critical infrastructure has been wiped out, washed away. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Roads, highways, bridges destroyed, entire communities cut off from all civilization. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=379.28s)]
*  We still have no idea. We don't know how many people may desperately be waiting to be rescued. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  And Joe Biden is in DC telling us everybody's getting all the help they need after last weekend [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=393.36s)]
*  staying on the beach all weekend. And now he's yucking it up with his friends in the media mob. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=399.76s)]
*  Our very own Sarah Carter on the ground in Western North Carolina. And what she's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=405.12s)]
*  witnessing is absolutely gut wrenching. Take a look. There's just no words. I don't think people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=410.24s)]
*  can even understand what this is like unless they walk through your community to see this. I've never [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=415.6s)]
*  would have imagined. I mean, I'm from the Gulf Coast and I've been through a lot of hurricanes, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=422.88s)]
*  but nothing like this. You've never seen it like this? No. What about FEMA? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=427.92s)]
*  FEMA? I haven't seen FEMA. I don't know anything about FEMA as far as them coming around. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=433.76s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever had to experience anything like this. So I don't know [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=440.0s)]
*  what protocol is. So I'm just being patient and waiting. I have heard rumors that they are around, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=444.0s)]
*  but I haven't seen anybody. And we're right here in the middle of ground zero. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=450.8s)]
*  So and we've been here every day. So it's not that we've missed them. We just missed them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=454.96s)]
*  It's just been amazing that it's been a real community effort. Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=460.96s)]
*  Yeah. Like I tell you, it just brings me to tears to see people chip in like this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=464.64s)]
*  Right now, the New York Post and some others have reported [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=470.32s)]
*  that basically FEMA, FEMA has allocated $1.4 billion, but that money was allocated for [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  illegal migraine crisis, not for hurricanes, not for natural disasters, for the illegal [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  migration crisis. When you hear that as a taxpayer, what goes through your mind? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=488.64s)]
*  Anger. You should look out for your people that are helping you run this country. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  We just need help. We need FEMA. We need somebody to start rolling in with some dollars. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=500.4s)]
*  Bad. It's just dire. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=506.08s)]
*  I know you told me earlier, you've never asked for a dollar in your life from anyone, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=509.68s)]
*  but this is one of those times where the American public, just like your neighbors, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=513.2s)]
*  might have to pick up the slack and help your community get out of this. Right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=520.0s)]
*  Yeah, we will. We'll have to. We don't have a choice. I may not be able to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=526.6400000000001s)]
*  open my business back up again. I hope so. I'm telling people that I am because I want to give [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=534.72s)]
*  hope. But if I can't, then I'll have plenty of idle time to help. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=540.16s)]
*  Maybe it's time that Joe and Kamala Katrina Harris head back south and go to the southeast [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=550.0s)]
*  and take another look and get to work, or maybe FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=557.28s)]
*  designed to help Americans in emergency situations, maybe they should be focused [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=563.12s)]
*  on emergency management, not illegal immigration, not on DEI and equity, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=569.28s)]
*  which is a big part of their quote mission in writing. If you look at FEMA's strategic plan, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=575.52s)]
*  instilling equity is the number one goal stated in the agency's official strategic plan. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=581.2s)]
*  What is equity doing right now to save lives in North Carolina and Georgia? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=588.8s)]
*  What is it doing? What is equity doing to rebuild roads and bridges and give people [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=593.12s)]
*  food and water and shelter? What is equity doing to get people the things that they need, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=597.68s)]
*  the time, the energy, the taxpayer money that FEMA wasted on left-wing political obsessions [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=603.44s)]
*  is an absolute disgrace? Taking money for Americans and giving it to their illegal [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=609.6s)]
*  immigrants that they are obsessed with? It is unconscionable. It is soulless. It is heartless. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=615.76s)]
*  It's no wonder the response has been an utter disaster. And today, while Kamala campaigned in [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=621.92s)]
*  Michigan, Donald Trump, he was back on the ground. He was touring the hurricane damage in Georgia [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=627.76s)]
*  with Governor Brian Kemp, who said he had to go back to the federal government three times. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  He wanted 90 counties declared a disaster area. He got 11. Then he went back. Then they gave him 30. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=638.7199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I think finally they stepped up today after he had to make multiple calls to get [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  the help he needed. Take a look. Let me first of all just say thank you so much for joining us as [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=650.56s)]
*  we continue to work day and night to recover from this historic but also horrific storm. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=655.76s)]
*  I want to thank you for keeping the nation's attention on those who are hurting in Georgia. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  And I certainly appreciate President Trump helping us do that as well. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=667.1199999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. Your governor is doing a fantastic job, I will tell you that. And [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  uh we're all with him and with everybody. We've just met a group of really wonderful patriots [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=676.56s)]
*  that are working very hard. They've done it before, but they told me they've never seen one like this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=683.04s)]
*  I'm not thinking about voters right now. I'm thinking about lives. And to be honest, it's [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=687.52s)]
*  much bigger than anything else, but we're thinking about lives. A lot of lives lost, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=693.04s)]
*  a lot of people missing. And that's what I'd be focused on right now. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=696.96s)]
*  Now there's a famous saying that a big part of success is just showing up, but tonight, Kamala, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=701.36s)]
*  Joe, they're nowhere to be found. And sadly, this isn't the only crisis that is festering under Biden [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=706.16s)]
*  and Harris. Tonight, the Middle East is on the verge of an all-out war. Our closest ally, Israel, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=711.92s)]
*  in the region, attacked by Iran with a barrage of intercontinental ballistic missiles. And it's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=718.56s)]
*  only a matter of time, by the way, before Israel must respond. And of course, then comes the pressure [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=724.72s)]
*  from Joe and Kamala to appease the Iranians, but they were the ones that made Iran rich. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=730.08s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala is also facing a personal scandal tonight, breaking this week a new daily [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=735.44s)]
*  mail report outlining shocking allegations against Kamala's husband, the second gentleman, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=741.44s)]
*  Dougie. According to the report, he is accused of forcefully slapping his ex-girlfriend in 2012 for [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=747.84s)]
*  flirting with another man while at the Cannes Film Festival event in France. Now, we've not [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  independently verified the claims, allegedly made by three of the women's friends to the Daily Mail, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=760.64s)]
*  and the outlet also never spoke with the alleged victim. And, well, Doug Emhoff's representative [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=766.64s)]
*  gave a statement for Semaphore denying all allegations. We also reached out for a statement, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=773.44s)]
*  I've not heard back, we will continue to monitor that story. Now, this allegation comes after he [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=779.52s)]
*  was forced to admit that he impregnated his kid's teacher while married to his first wife. Okay, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=784.8s)]
*  if it was a Trump allegation, you'd think the media would be all over it. I'm pretty sure. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAj5ULbiiuk&t=791.68s)]
