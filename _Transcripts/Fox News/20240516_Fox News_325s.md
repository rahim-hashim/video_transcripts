# Give us all the evidence! Rep. Jim Jordan
**Fox News:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg)
*  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan joins us now with more. All right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=0.0s)]
*  Before we do all those let's go to Colangelo for a minute here and talk about him now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  I would think that the third highest ranking official in the US Department of Justice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=10.0s)]
*  That would be considered a pretty prestigious position. Would it not mr. Jordan, sir? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  No, it sure would and that's what mr. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=19.86s)]
*  Colangelo had before he went up to work for Alvin Bragg but Sean it's even worse because he started with Letitia James [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  So he went after President Trump with the state attorney general [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=29.44s)]
*  Then he comes and works the number three position in the Justice Department in the Biden Justice Department [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=32.96s)]
*  And then he goes back up to New York to work for Alvin Bragg and be the chief prosecutor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=37.0s)]
*  Against President Trump in this ridiculous trial where Michael Cohen the convicted perjurer the guy who's lied multiple times to everybody is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  the star witness [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=49.92s)]
*  now didn't the issue of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=51.72s)]
*  For example, you are the chairman of a committee. We have last time I checked we have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=54.44s)]
*  Co-equal branches of government and that your branch of government you're a member of Congress the legislative branch [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=59.76s)]
*  That you would have oversight over the executive branch and that that would be part of Congress's role, correct? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=65.96s)]
*  Sure is one of our constitutional duties to do oversight of the executive branch and the agencies that fall under our jurisdiction [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Homeland Security and of course the Department of Justice [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=78.72s)]
*  All right. Can you then Jim Jordan? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=82.52s)]
*  Congressman, can you explain to me? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=85.44s)]
*  Based on what you just said [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  How it is that the Garland actually mentioned the political impact of the tape? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  early on when their request came in to turn that tape over or and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  Transcript over that they didn't want to turn over [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  That it might have an impact on the election because withholding it sounds to me like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  He's trying to tip the election or the scales of the election in favor of his boss Joe Biden [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=113.3s)]
*  Yeah, and you yeah, and you just played that they said Biden and and the Attorney General said they want to be independent and impartial [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=118.98s)]
*  Okay, that's what we're supposed to evaluate. That's part of our oversight [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=125.66s)]
*  What we do know is you've charged President Trump with a crime on the classified documents issue and you didn't charge Joe Biden [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=129.42s)]
*  Are you really being impartial? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=136.34s)]
*  Particularly when on page one of Robert heard the special counsel's report [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  He says Joe Biden knowingly kept and Joe Biden knowingly disclosed classified information on page 231 of his report [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  He said Joe Biden had strong motivations for ignoring classified procedures [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=150.18s)]
*  He knew he was writing a book a book for which he got paid an eight million dollar advance [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=154.78s)]
*  So we have motive an eight million dollar motive. We have the elements of the crime net [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  But Robert Hurst says we're not going to bring a charge [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=165.18s)]
*  We're not going to recommend charges because he's a forgetful elderly gentleman [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=168.74s)]
*  Okay, so give us all the evidence and by the way [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=173.22s)]
*  Joe Biden's already waived executive privilege when he released everything including the transcript [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=175.78s)]
*  We just want the best evidence so we can evaluate if in fact the Department of Justice is truly being [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=180.94s)]
*  Independent and impartial which is our job under the Constitution [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=187.74s)]
*  That's why we held him in contempt and it passed out a committee earlier today [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=191.9s)]
*  Okay, would that contempt hold into a next administration? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=197.22s)]
*  If in fact Donald Trump becomes the next president the 47th president [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=201.26s)]
*  Sure would and some US attorney who thinks that that that should be followed up on could do that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=206.94s)]
*  But I think what we're probably going to have to do now is go to court and see what the see what a court tells us [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=211.58s)]
*  But I think the case is strong and then you can go back to the Nixon case when they got the they got the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=216.5s)]
*  Audio tapes and Nixon and and that wasn't after an interview or anything like that. That wasn't in the criminal [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=221.5s)]
*  That was part of an impeachment inquiry, which oh by the way, we're in right now [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=226.46s)]
*  The House has voted to move into an impeachment inquiry. All right, this is part of that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=229.18s)]
*  So our case is even stronger than the than the case that's on point, which was the Mitchell case relative to President Nixon [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=232.98s)]
*  Isn't this really about preventing the American people voters from seeing Joe Biden asking questions like [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  was I still president in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=247.22s)]
*  2009 and all of the other [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=249.74s)]
*  Disastrous moment described by mr. Herr. Isn't that what this is really all about? I [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=252.7s)]
*  Don't know what their motivation is. I can I can guess and I think you can too [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=257.62s)]
*  I think the viewers can guess what I know is what our job is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=261.3s)]
*  Which is to make sure the Department of Justice is living up to the standard [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=264.26s)]
*  It's supposed to be which is equal treatment under the law for everybody. We don't think that's happening and frankly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=267.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=274.54s)]
*  Transparent we heard mr. Sands. He said they're gonna be transparent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=277.1s)]
*  Right until it came to the audio tapes, which is demeanor evidence [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  It you can get the tone the cadence the voice you hear all kinds of things there that are important [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  I think pieces of information for us to make that evaluation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=289.22s)]
*  But all these cases are falling apart because they're all political and the country I think sees that clearly [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=291.92s)]
*  Release the tapes [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=299.94s)]
*  Let the American people decide let's have a free and fair election [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's get the weaponization of the DOJ out of politics and let's get law and order returned [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMx5pK0WVrg&t=305.58000000000004s)]
