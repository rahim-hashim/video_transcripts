# Jason Chaffetz: This is another 'humiliating' day for Biden
**Fox News:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jason Chaffetz in Furshawn. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=3.04s)]
*  And tonight, we're at the end of another [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=5.44s)]
*  humiliating day for Joe Biden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=8.08s)]
*  The president just wrapped up a crisis meeting with 24 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=10.32s)]
*  Democratic governors at the White House. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=13.92s)]
*  After the meeting, three of the governors voiced their [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=16.88s)]
*  support for Biden outside the White House, while the others [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  avoided the cameras, including his rumored successors. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=23.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, a growing number of other top Democrats are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=27.52s)]
*  demanding that Biden drop out of the race. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=30.96s)]
*  As we speak, a large number of liberal lawmakers are [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=33.6s)]
*  reportedly preparing to call on Biden to step aside. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=37.28s)]
*  And on CNN and MSNBC, the wall-to-wall coverage of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=41.2s)]
*  president's cognitive decline is unyielding. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=45.36s)]
*  But Joe is refusing to drop out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=48.96s)]
*  Last night, he told donors that jetlag was to blame for his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=51.44s)]
*  poor debate performance. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=55.44s)]
*  Biden said he almost fell asleep at the podium because of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=57.68s)]
*  his trip to Europe that ended 12 days before the debate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=62.72s)]
*  And today, during another dishonest White House press [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=67.84s)]
*  briefing, Kareem Jean-Pierre echoed the president's bizarre [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=71.28s)]
*  excuses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=75.44s)]
*  Have a look. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=76.4s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever, as I have known him to be in my [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=77.92s)]
*  engagement and my experience with him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=81.52s)]
*  He arrived back in the United States 12 or 13 days before the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=84.08s)]
*  debate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=87.76s)]
*  So his explanation for a poor debate performance is jetlag. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=88.32s)]
*  So what I want to say is it's the jetlag and also the cold. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=91.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=96.56s)]
*  It is the two things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=96.96s)]
*  And that occurred. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=99.2s)]
*  He has a, especially when he travels abroad, it's a pretty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=100.96s)]
*  rigorous travel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=104.32s)]
*  We get tired looking at him doing his meetings and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=105.36s)]
*  traveling. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=109.2s)]
*  And so I think that's what he was speaking to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=109.92s)]
*  And I don't think it has a toll on, regardless of what age [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=112.4s)]
*  you are, it has a toll on you that type of travel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=116.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=119.76s)]
*  Watching those people jump out of planes and parachutes is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  exhausting, Kareem. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  It's just exhausting, especially on Air Force One where you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  can't lay down in a bed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=128.96s)]
*  Or I guess maybe you can. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=130.0s)]
*  So according to a CBS News poll, 72% of registered voters [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=131.52s)]
*  think that Biden is mentally unfit to serve as president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=136.88s)]
*  But the White House is refusing to administer a cognitive exam [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=141.28s)]
*  or release a full medical record. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=146.0s)]
*  Today, he had just one public event, a Medal of Honor ceremony [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=149.28s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, just one public event, a short scripted speech [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=155.44s)]
*  across town. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=159.44s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting that many are, quote, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  shaken by his relative inaction over the previous six days to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=164.48s)]
*  directly address the panic ignited by his halting debate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=169.36s)]
*  performance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=173.6s)]
*  The president won't even come out to the podium to answer a few [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=175.04s)]
*  unscripted questions from the briefing room, despite repeated [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=178.16s)]
*  requests from reporters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=182.24s)]
*  Maybe that's because it interferes with, you know, nap time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=184.24s)]
*  Apparently during his week-long debate prep at Camp David, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=188.56s)]
*  Biden required a mid-afternoon nap every single day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=192.72s)]
*  But at the briefing, Kareem Jean-Pierre would not confirm [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=198.24s)]
*  nor deny Biden's reliance on afternoon naps. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=201.36s)]
*  Make no mistake, the writing is on the wall. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  This game is up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  And behind closed doors, Democrats are reportedly furious [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  that the Biden family refuses to vacate the White House [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=214.72000000000003s)]
*  to give their party a fighting chance in November. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=218.0s)]
*  In the meantime, I can report tonight that House Committee [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  Overseas Chairman James Comer is preparing to bring the White [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=225.12s)]
*  House physician before Congress to possibly answer a few [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=229.28s)]
*  questions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOL3rVIvG8&t=234.0s)]
