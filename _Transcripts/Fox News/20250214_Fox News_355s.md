# DOGE hit Democrats’ ‘Achilles heel’: Alina Habba
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A)
*  Joining us with more, counselor to the president, Alina Haber. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's start with those two. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=3.52s)]
*  Well, good to have you, by the way. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Let's start with those last two items. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's interesting, because the president gets elected to do a job—I think this is—there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=8.08s)]
*  are 40 lawsuits in total out there against Donald Trump and the administration so far. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=12.72s)]
*  But I believe the court's—as part of the executive branch, he has the authority to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=18.06s)]
*  do everything he's doing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=22.72s)]
*  Your reaction to the first two court decisions? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=24.22s)]
*  Well, first of all, absolutely, he has the authority to do what he's doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=29.12s)]
*  As we've seen yesterday, we had momentum where we were giving people money to walk [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=33.0s)]
*  away if you don't want to come to work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=40.84s)]
*  And we'll pay you till October. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=41.84s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=43.36s)]
*  But they tried to stop it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=44.36s)]
*  Sean, we know what's going on here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=45.36s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=46.72s)]
*  It's the same thing that's been happening for the last three and a half years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=47.72s)]
*  They're panicking, and the only thing they do is go to radical left judges that want [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=50.24s)]
*  to make a name for themselves to stop the executive branch for doing exactly what was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=53.8s)]
*  mandated to do on November 5th when we swept the nation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=62.44s)]
*  And frankly, this is all over everything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=64.08s)]
*  I was discussing this actually with Elon, and I said, you know, for all the money you've [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=65.96s)]
*  saved this country, perhaps we should also have a ticker for every case that they're [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=70.44s)]
*  going to bring. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=77.28s)]
*  It's going to go up while this one goes down, because that's what they do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=78.28s)]
*  If we want to save money, people are going to get upset. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=82.36s)]
*  Why are they getting upset? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=83.8s)]
*  Because we're taking money out of their pockets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=84.8s)]
*  The best thing that Elon Musk is going to do is going to look at people's salaries [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=87.16s)]
*  and say, OK, if you make X amount of money and you're worth $68 million, we're going [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=89.88s)]
*  to look at why that is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=96.68s)]
*  And that's really the bottom line, because we could talk about everything, every executive [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=98.24s)]
*  order, but there is a panic in D.C. at this moment, where I now live, and it is very simple. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=101.76s)]
*  We are cutting them off from their funding. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=108.58s)]
*  And that means politicians not just saving taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  And that's where the panic is coming from. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=115.72s)]
*  It's pretty basic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=117.28s)]
*  Look, obviously, if you're friends with Donald Trump, you're going to be hated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=118.28s)]
*  All right, so we'll check that box on the Elon Musk side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=122.84s)]
*  But correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=127.36s)]
*  Isn't he the guy that offered Starlink when people in North Carolina had no communication [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=128.36s)]
*  with the outside world and he donated that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=134.08s)]
*  Didn't he offer the same thing to the people of California? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=136.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=138.88s)]
*  So we have two astronauts that have been pretty much lost in space or abandoned now [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=139.88s)]
*  for nearly 300 days, and our government can't save them, so he's going to go rescue them, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=143.72s)]
*  you know, and he's cutting out all of this waste. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=149.6s)]
*  Sean. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=153.0s)]
*  Well, why would you hate somebody like that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=154.0s)]
*  It's so basic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=156.28s)]
*  I'm grateful. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=157.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=158.28s)]
*  It's very basic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=159.28s)]
*  Let's think about this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=160.28s)]
*  In our administration, we have a tremendous amount of billionaires who are successful [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=161.38s)]
*  businessmen, and I could name them all, but we know who they are, who have taken a leave, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=166.64s)]
*  sold their companies, walked away from their lives to sacrifice to help America be great [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=173.2s)]
*  again. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=178.55999999999997s)]
*  There are many, many. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=179.55999999999997s)]
*  Now, Elon's become a target for one very simple reason, because he is cutting the funding [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  to these politicians who have put their bureaucratic personal financial gain and interest above [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=187.72s)]
*  the American people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=194.92s)]
*  That is the difference. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=197.56s)]
*  That may not be felt by some of the other people that are in the administration that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=198.56s)]
*  have done the same thing that Elon does, that are incredibly successful billionaires, but [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=202.0s)]
*  they are targeting him because he is cutting their lifeline, their financial. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=207.0s)]
*  Listen, Nancy made how much money? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=211.64s)]
*  And we're going to go down the line of looking at all these people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=214.24s)]
*  There is no reason, as a federal employee, me included, I shouldn't walk out richer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=218.28s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=223.12s)]
*  That should not be the case. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=224.4s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=225.4s)]
*  I can guarantee you— [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to open you up to look, because it's not going to happen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  You don't do it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  You would make a lot more in the private sector. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=231.16s)]
*  Elon Musk will probably make a lot less. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=233.96s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=235.96s)]
*  Although, you know, when you have that kind of money, that money makes enough money, you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=236.96s)]
*  know, on its own, in a sense, even if you put it in a treasury of 5 percent. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=240.4s)]
*  Not a bad deal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=246.16s)]
*  And the president doesn't take a paycheck. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=248.6s)]
*  He's losing money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=250.52s)]
*  People are in this to serve their country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  I would argue almost everybody that you see every day in that White House is not making money. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  We don't. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  And the only reason they're screaming about Elon, it's very simple. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  Nobody has said it yet, and I'm going to say it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=264.8s)]
*  It's because they're hitting their pockets. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=266.52s)]
*  Only reason they're screaming about Elon. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=268.76s)]
*  They're not screaming about Howard Lutnick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=270.36s)]
*  They're not screaming about Bergman. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  They're not screaming about those billionaires. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=275.08s)]
*  They're screaming about him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=276.88s)]
*  And that's because he's going in and hitting where it hurts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=278.68s)]
*  So you know what happens when you scream and when you sing songs outside at a rally, which, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=281.92s)]
*  by the way, what are you doing on the American taxpayer dollars creating songs against the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=286.92s)]
*  Republican Party? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=290.56s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=291.56s)]
*  But when you're doing things like that, that says to me one very simple thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  We have hit your Achilles heel, and we will continue to hit you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=296.64s)]
*  We will look at why our children are not educated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=300.18s)]
*  We will look at why our children have an increase in ADHD. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=302.78s)]
*  We will look at why our borders are not safe, why our security is crazy and why there is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=305.96s)]
*  Fentanyl crisis right now in our country like we have never seen because illegal immigrants [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=309.64s)]
*  were supposed to come in and vote for Kamala Harris, but it didn't work out for them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  So they are panicking. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=317.12s)]
*  And Elon may be triggering just a little bit of insecurity, which is that they are worried [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=318.94s)]
*  about us looking at exactly what they've done and exactly how much they've made. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=322.58s)]
*  And that is now stopping. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's a panic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a panic on their part. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans, the average American making 66 grand a year when they see all this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse and they understand it more, they'll be cheering. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=337.88s)]
*  Alina Habba, we appreciate your time as always. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=342.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rC0qqzWy9A&t=344.32s)]
