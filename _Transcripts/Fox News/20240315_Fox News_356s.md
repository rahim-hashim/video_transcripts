# Hannity: Fani Willis threw her lover 'under the bus'
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE)
*  We begin with our top story out of Fulton County, Georgia, tonight, where disgraced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=0.0s)]
*  anti-Trump District Attorney Fonny Willis has now turned the Atlanta court system into [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=4.88s)]
*  nothing but a joke. Now, today, the Superior Court judge in this case, Scott McAfee, all [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=10.64s)]
*  but accused Willis of lying, corruption and, frankly, gross misconduct. He slammed the, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=16.56s)]
*  quote, financial cloud of impropriety surrounding her illicit affair and co-mingling of finances [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=22.64s)]
*  with the outside counsel that she hired, with hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=29.84s)]
*  funds to help prosecute, of course, Donald Trump. And now he called her bizarre outburst [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=35.76s)]
*  during testimony unprofessional. He accused both Willis and her lover, Nathan Wade, of, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=41.76s)]
*  quote, potential untruthfulness. The judge even stated that, quote, an odor of mendacity remains. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=47.36s)]
*  In other words, Fonny's motives and actions as Fulton County DAs stink to high heaven. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=54.24s)]
*  He also rebuked Fonny Willis for playing the race card during a recent speech designed to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=59.76s)]
*  smear Donald Trump and others for merely exercising their legal rights. But, of course, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=65.2s)]
*  despite all the misconduct, Judge McAfee ruled that Fonny Willis is free and clear to continue [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=70.56s)]
*  her quest against Donald Trump so long as she cans her former or current $654,000 lover, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=76.96s)]
*  Nathan Wade. Does that make sense? Now, right on cue earlier today, Wade officially resigned. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=85.92s)]
*  It appears that Willis threw Wade right under the bus. Naturally, the taxpayers of Georgia, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=91.28s)]
*  they will not be receiving a refund, and Fonny Willis will not face any legal consequences, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=96.56s)]
*  as one popular legal account on X pointed out, quote, Judge McAfee rules that only one potential [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=102.48s)]
*  liar can prosecute the case, but not both potential liars. Now, does that make any sense? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=108.88s)]
*  Of course not. But she's a Democrat trying to prosecute Donald Trump, so I guess apparently [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=114.72s)]
*  she's probably above the law. Still the media mob, they recognize this as a devastating blow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=120.48s)]
*  Fonny Willis is now embarrassing them, making their case against Donald Trump look petty and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=126.4s)]
*  stupid, which it was from the beginning, and now lashing out. Watch this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=132.32s)]
*  This is such a huge body blow, almost a fatal blow to Fonny Willis. I think the way forward [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=137.04s)]
*  is she has to voluntarily recuse herself. I don't know that she has it in her. The DA should [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=144.08s)]
*  consider recusing herself as well as the case moves forward to allow it to do so cleanly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  All of this, especially this language from the judge, and we're just skimming the opinion right [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=155.68s)]
*  now, I'm sure there's likely more, it's really a gift to former President Trump and his co-defendants [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=159.12s)]
*  because they're not only going to fight this case on the merits, they fight it in the court of a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  public opinion. Optics here matter. Any one of these statements by a judge would be a career [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=167.84s)]
*  ender for a normal prosecutor. To have an on-the-record finding that there are reasonable [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=172.8s)]
*  questions about whether you lied under oath, that would be devastating. And we'll see what [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=176.96s)]
*  the political effects will be. The bottom line, the DA survives, but not without serious bruising, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  to use your analogy, sir. Now, even the Washington Post is calling the ruling a significant setback [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=187.84s)]
*  for Fonny Willis. The New York Times also openly worried about the case and the new series of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  inquiries from the Georgia legislature and, of course, the Judiciary Committee that's led by [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=199.76s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan. Now, Chairman Jordan recently threatened to hold Fonny Willis in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  contempt if she fails to produce subpoenaed documents by March the 28th. Make no mistake, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=209.84s)]
*  despite Judge McAfee's ruling today, there are still many questions, lots of doubts, looming over [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=216.0s)]
*  Fonny's desperate attempt to get Donald Trump. Ultimately, why would anyone trust a DA [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=223.44s)]
*  credibly accused of lying and corruption, a person rebuked by a judge as unprofessional, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  a potential liar, tainted by a cloud of financial misconduct and racial bias, a prosecutor who is, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  what, above all else, a giant hypocrite? You might remember this. Because you're sitting with someone [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  today that actually wants to make a difference, because they deserve a DA that won't have sex [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=248.32s)]
*  with his employees, because they deserve a DA that won't put money in their own pocket. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=254.24s)]
*  I certainly will not be choosing people to date that work under me. Let me just say that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=260.48s)]
*  Wow. Those rules apply for thee, but not for Fonny Willis. At the end of the day, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=266.64s)]
*  well, devout Democrat Fonny Willis brought a massive case with dozens of charges against Trump [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=271.6s)]
*  and several other Republicans. She then directed over $650,000 in Georgia taxpayer funds, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=277.2s)]
*  again, to her on and off again lover, Nathan Wade, to help prosecute the case. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=285.28s)]
*  Now, Wade did not have much relevant experience, which is amazing, but was reportedly paid more [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=290.24s)]
*  than other outside counsels. And during their personal and professional relationship and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=296.8s)]
*  partnership, Fonny Willis, well, she went on those lavish trips and vacations with Nathan Wade [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=302.0s)]
*  with the money she was paying him, or the taxpayers were. And apparently she benefited [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=307.92s)]
*  financially from that relationship. And yet, Fonny Willis believes she has done absolutely [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=312.96s)]
*  nothing wrong. She truly believes she is above the law, that the justice system in blue cities, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=318.4s)]
*  blue states is corrupt and biased beyond belief. As it stands now, no Republican or conservative [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=324.56s)]
*  will ever get a fair trial in these jurisdictions, especially not anybody with the last name Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=331.28s)]
*  This is nothing but a kangaroo court with political motives. It is rotting our justice [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=338.08s)]
*  system from within. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlVs5XTiHuE&t=342.88s)]
