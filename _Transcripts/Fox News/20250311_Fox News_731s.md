# Sean Hannity: We are closer to peace in Europe thanks to Trump
**Fox News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we have a lot of ground to cover with big developments at home and abroad. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=6.32s)]
*  We will get our White House briefing from her and more on her clash with the so-called [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=8.6s)]
*  reporter from the very anti-Trump Associated Press, very woke Associated Press. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=13.4s)]
*  And later, part two of my exclusive interview with HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  made this promise during our trip this weekend to Steak and Shake. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=23.68s)]
*  If you tried to take away the president's favorite foods, you would be fired. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=29.22s)]
*  I'm pretty convinced. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=33.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to do that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=34.46s)]
*  You know, you better not take away the president's food. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=36.74s)]
*  Not going to happen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, we're going to have much more of our interview later in the show. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  We'll talk about measles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=43.86s)]
*  We will talk about the price of eggs and Avion and everything else that's going on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  But first tonight, thanks to President Trump, we are one giant step closer to peace in Europe. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  Ah, we can all pray. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=56.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=57.739999999999995s)]
*  Today, we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict in a way that's enduring and sustainable [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=63.86s)]
*  and accounts for their interests, their security, their ability to prosper as a nation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=69.5s)]
*  We'll take this offer now to the Russians. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=73.88s)]
*  And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  The ball is now in their court. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=78.14s)]
*  The fighting has to stop. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's what we agreed today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=81.02000000000001s)]
*  And just think about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=82.44s)]
*  We've gone from if the war is going to end to now how the war is going to end. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=84.82000000000001s)]
*  And this was an important first step. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=89.74s)]
*  And that was under President Trump's leadership. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=92.06s)]
*  He has literally moved the entire global conversation to where we had a very senior Ukrainian delegation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=94.1s)]
*  with us today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=99.58s)]
*  We've had engagements with our Russian counterparts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=100.58s)]
*  And now it's how the war is going to end. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=104.22s)]
*  And that's under President Trump's leadership. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=106.58s)]
*  Ah, I wonder all the praise from America's old school hippie liberals, you know, the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=108.38s)]
*  ones that used to love to sing, you know, all we're saying is give peace a chance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  Where have all those people gone? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=118.7s)]
*  This is by far the closest we have come to peace since the start of this war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=120.48s)]
*  I hope the death and destruction ends. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=124.34s)]
*  Anybody with a heart, conscience and soul should hope for the same. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=126.42s)]
*  But just 10 days ago, my memory serves me well, the state-run legacy media mob, Democrats, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=129.9s)]
*  they were all hysterical. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=135.62s)]
*  This after Zelensky's tense meeting at the White House, they told us Trump ruined America's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=137.32s)]
*  relationship with Ukraine and are standing around the world for years and years to come. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=141.78s)]
*  And that peace was never going to even have a chance to happen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=147.33999999999997s)]
*  You might recall. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  Becoming the air hours after an Oval Office ambush of an American ally that will reverberate [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  all around the world and stain America's image for years to come. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  It revealed instead of Donald Trump and a JD Vance clearly on an errand for Vladimir [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  Putin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  They are popping the champagne in Moscow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=169.86s)]
*  They've got their best vodka out and they're doing shots as we speak. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=172.18s)]
*  I mean, that's exactly the same thought that went through my head. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  The propaganda is what's coming out of JD Vance's mouth and it's Russian propaganda. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  Caitlin, I want to start with look at her face. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=182.66s)]
*  I mean, Christiane, hold that thought for once. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=185.5s)]
*  OK, actually, Christiane, please take it away. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=189.46s)]
*  Never in the history of modern diplomacy, war, peace, whatever, have I ever, ever, ever [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=194.78s)]
*  seen anything like it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=202.58s)]
*  No, you've never met a force like Donald Trump before. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=204.38s)]
*  That's about right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=208.02s)]
*  Blinded by their anti-Trump rage, Democrats, the legacy media mob, they are unable, unwilling [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=209.02s)]
*  to tell their viewers the truth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=215.38s)]
*  Now, if you are watching this program, you are definitely better informed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  In fact, here is what I was reporting 10 days ago. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=221.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=224.9s)]
*  Now, if the media mob wasn't so blinded by their anti-Trump rage, they'd be able to see the following [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=237.9s)]
*  pattern. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=242.42s)]
*  Let me walk you through it, especially if you're in the state-run media mob. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=243.42s)]
*  I'll go very slow for your benefit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=246.06s)]
*  President Trump introduces a plan, and tense negotiations usually ensue right thereafter. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=249.18s)]
*  Step two, Democrats, the media, they all freak out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=255.94s)]
*  It's like Alka-Seltzer in water. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=258.94s)]
*  They bubble and fizz, and they hate Trump, and they tell everyone that the sky is falling [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  and the world is coming to an end. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=265.5s)]
*  Step three, Donald Trump uses America's tremendous strength and leverage to negotiate as many [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=267.64s)]
*  favorable deals that are in America and the world's best interest. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=273.38s)]
*  Step four, the Chicken Littles on the left, they look stupid and dishonest as per usual. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=277.94s)]
*  This pattern is now playing out yet again with trade negotiations and tariffs against [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, etc. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=289.58s)]
*  Canada just backed down from a 25 percent tax on electricity, exported to the U.S., [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=290.58s)]
*  and Trump's proposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, they have been paused, while [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  the two countries hopefully will be able to hammer out a deal of free and fair trade. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, we've got to deal with real issues here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=306.06s)]
*  Canada must address three very glaring issues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  First, they need to shut down illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking across their border [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  with the U.S. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  It has never been higher than it is now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  Second, the free ride for our friends in Canada, and I consider the people in Canada our friends, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=321.58s)]
*  is over. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  Canada must start paying for their own self-defense. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  And don't forget, all NATO allies are required to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=330.82s)]
*  The U.S. spends nearly double that target, at almost $1 trillion a year. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  Canada, meanwhile, only spends a measly 1.37 percent of its GDP on national defense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=342.97999999999996s)]
*  Our neighbors to the north must fulfill their obligation to NATO. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  Third, the issue that Canada must resolve are the pre-Trump tariffs and limits imposed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=355.26s)]
*  against a variety of American goods. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  You may not know this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=363.58s)]
*  We already have a trade imbalance with Canada, and by the way, they already have put tariffs [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=364.98s)]
*  on us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=370.2s)]
*  How many of you knew that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=371.2s)]
*  For example, a base 7.5 percent tariff on milk, but the amount of imports is capped, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=372.2s)]
*  and after that cap is reached, then the tariff rises to a whopping 241 percent. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=378.3s)]
*  That's not good for American dairy farmers in Wisconsin and elsewhere. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=384.74s)]
*  There's also a 200 percent supply management tariff on eggs and poultry, and nearly a 300 [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=389.02s)]
*  percent supply management tariff on butter and cheese. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=394.82s)]
*  Now, for our friends to the north, we either have free and fair trade or we don't. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=398.9s)]
*  If they want free and fair trade, Donald Trump will give it to them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=404.46s)]
*  If they choose reciprocal tariffs, that will be on them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=407.8s)]
*  Now, I'll also add one last thing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  Canada spends $30 billion on their military every year. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=414.42s)]
*  The U.S. spends nearly a trillion dollars, and the world knows that the United States [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  will protect our friends to the north in Canada if they are ever in need. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=424.1s)]
*  Just a little more appreciation would be nice from our friends to the north, and I'm not [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=430.02000000000004s)]

*  Tonight, we are seeing this very same pattern play out with Doge as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  But the hysteria directed and the outright evil directed at Elon Musk is absolutely insane. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=450.38000000000005s)]

*  You know, the smears, the lies from the media mob, the Democratic Party, the radical left [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=463.82000000000005s)]
*  are nonstop. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=468.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=469.86s)]
*  All because Elon Musk supported Donald Trump, is now helping Donald Trump and losing billions [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  of dollars in the process. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=477.26s)]
*  He's helping to identify waste fraud abuse in the Washington swamp. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=479.1s)]
*  He's helping to save our country from ultimate bankruptcy and insolvency. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  He's also, you know, will hopefully be saving astronauts in just a few short days. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=486.62s)]
*  I pray that mission goes well. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=492.3s)]
*  I have every hope that it will. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=494.06s)]
*  And today, the White House announced that attacks against Tesla dealerships will be [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=495.94s)]
*  labeled as domestic terrorism. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=500.02s)]
*  And he had this to say about the leader of Doge. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=502.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=504.38s)]
*  This man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=505.38s)]
*  I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=509.94s)]
*  And I just want people to know that you can't be penalized for being a patriot. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=515.02s)]
*  And he's a great patriot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=519.54s)]
*  Now, let's be clear. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=521.74s)]
*  The anger, the hysteria, the directed at Elon Musk and Doge from the left. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=523.62s)]
*  It is ugly. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=530.14s)]
*  It is sick. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=531.14s)]
*  It is twisted, is now becoming downright evil and dangerous. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=532.14s)]
*  And for the record, as I promised yesterday, I ordered my Tesla today. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=534.3s)]
*  It's on X. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=539.9s)]
*  If you want to go look at it, you can take a look at it or you can see it on Hannity.com. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=540.9s)]
*  But you start to understand the hysteria of the left when you see reports like this one [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=545.3s)]
*  from Politico, quote, U.S. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=549.86s)]
*  AID official tells remaining staffers, shred and burn your documents. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=551.92s)]
*  I think that would be illegal. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=558.14s)]
*  We ought to check with AG Pan-Bondi on that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=559.7s)]
*  That is a pretty good sign that Elon Musk and his team at Doge are doing exactly what [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  poll after poll of you, the American people, want them to do. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=567.78s)]
*  They are uncovering corruption and waste, fraud and abuse at the highest levels, all [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=571.88s)]
*  paid for with your hard-earned tax money. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=576.46s)]
*  He's hated for what? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=579.1800000000001s)]
*  Stopping an out-of-control bureaucracy from stealing from your children and your grandchildren. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=580.1800000000001s)]
*  And he's getting death threats. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=586.26s)]
*  His dealerships are being attacked. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=587.9s)]
*  His charging stations have put a blaze and a boycott to try and bankrupt him. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=589.5s)]
*  This is beyond sick. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=595.7s)]
*  And once again, the state-run media mob, Democratic Party, they look stupid, dishonest, etc. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=597.22s)]
*  But tonight, we have yet another example of this pattern surrounding the price of eggs. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=602.78s)]
*  For the past four weeks, the left has been in a state of hysteria. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=607.78s)]
*  Now, they told us, in spite of Biden inflation, that it was only transitory. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=611.1s)]
*  They said the border was secure. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=615.46s)]
*  They said Joe was a cognitive, you know, pillar of strength and the rising price of eggs, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=617.56s)]
*  blaming Trump for the economy that he inherited, even though the increase was caused by the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=622.92s)]
*  Biden administration and bird flu related to mass murder of chickens. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, after less than two months under Donald Trump, oh, look at this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=634.4s)]
*  Prices are starting to come down. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=640.88s)]
*  I had no inflation. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=641.88s)]
*  I had a great economy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=643.8399999999999s)]
*  He gave you high prices. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=645.9s)]
*  You couldn't buy bacon. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=647.5s)]
*  You couldn't buy anything. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=648.54s)]
*  And also, I inherited a situation with eggs. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=649.54s)]
*  The price of eggs was through the roof. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, now the price of eggs has come down a lot. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=655.18s)]
*  Interest rates have come down. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=658.26s)]
*  Gasoline prices have come down. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=659.78s)]
*  It's all coming down. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=662.74s)]
*  It's all a beautiful thing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=664.02s)]
*  I can do it the right way or the wrong way. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=665.74s)]
*  We're doing it the right way. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=667.26s)]
*  And I have tremendous confidence in this country and the people of this country, tremendous [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=668.5s)]
*  So then if I sat back for four years and had a good time in the Oval Office. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=674.02s)]
*  Now the moral of the story is simple. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=679.42s)]
*  Tune out the noise and the hysteria and the lying and the screaming. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=680.9399999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=685.46s)]
*  If there are great patriots that are trying to help our country and they're under fire [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=686.46s)]
*  for doing nothing but serving the people in this country, you know what? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=690.98s)]
*  Maybe we can help support them because obviously the left is just got a vendetta attitude about [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  everything. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt that we're still dealing with the effects of Biden's terrible presidency. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=701.62s)]
*  We are living under the Biden-Harris economy. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  But President Trump is busy now executing the plan that he wants to fix what is broken [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  and generate a new era of peace and prosperity, what he calls a golden age in America. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=714.14s)]
*  The results are starting to pour in. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-TxK0xMYg&t=719.86s)]
