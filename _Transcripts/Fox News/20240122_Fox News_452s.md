# Cruz: The GOP primary is essentially over
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw)
*  Now, tonight, the crisis at our southern border is a top issue for American voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=0.0s)]
*  And now, after lying to our face, the border is secure, the border is closed for three [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=5.94s)]
*  plus years, and pretending that that border was actually secure, well, Joe Biden is actually [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=10.22s)]
*  trying a new tactic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=15.4s)]
*  We have it on tape. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=16.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=17.8s)]
*  Did you believe that the border is secure? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=18.8s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=21.8s)]
*  I haven't believed it in the last ten years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=23.8s)]
*  And I've said it for the last ten years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=26.8s)]
*  Give me the money. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=28.8s)]
*  Oh, all of a sudden, according to Joe, the border hasn't been secure for a decade, since [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=30.8s)]
*  he was vice president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=36.8s)]
*  But it's just not his fault. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=38.8s)]
*  He wants you to believe there's nothing he can do. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=40.32s)]
*  By the way, there's plenty that he can do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't need Congress. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=44.36s)]
*  He inherited secure borders, and yet he wants you to forget about all those executive orders [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=45.78s)]
*  that he signed, making it easier to cross the border illegally, or all the aiding and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=51.06s)]
*  abetting that he's been involved in with the illegal immigrants and all the money that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=57.06s)]
*  has been spent by the federal government, by states, to pay for housing and healthcare [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  and education, etc., for people that didn't respect our laws, borders or sovereignty. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=67.3s)]
*  He also wants you to ignore his battle with the state of Texas while the Lone Star State [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=73.78s)]
*  attempts to fortify and secure their borders due to the job the federal government has [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=78.1s)]
*  failed to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=82.1s)]
*  The Biden administration actually sued Texas, took them all the way to the Supreme Court [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=83.33999999999999s)]
*  to stop the state from actually doing their job. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=87.64s)]
*  And today, well, mission accomplished for Joe Biden. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=91.06s)]
*  Five-four decision. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=93.66s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can cut down razor wire and other [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=94.72s)]
*  barriers to free up illegal entry for now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  And today to respond, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Senator, you're a constitutional scholar. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=102.78s)]
*  I am shocked at the chief justice at Amy Coney Barrett and them going along with the liberal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=107.14s)]
*  minority here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=112.78s)]
*  The federal government has been aiding and abetting, lawbreaking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden has not upheld his oath to our Constitution to enforce the laws of our land. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=117.66s)]
*  What else does Texas have available to them? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=124.14s)]
*  If they won't do the job, they've got to do it themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, Sean, that's exactly right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=128.74s)]
*  And listen, this decision makes me angry and even more angry is listening to Joe Biden [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=130.98s)]
*  just flat out lie. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=136.02s)]
*  And he knows he's lying, although actually, given his mental condition, maybe he doesn't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=137.5s)]
*  know he's lying. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=141.22s)]
*  But anyone rational that was aware of the world around him would know that he was lying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=142.22s)]
*  He says, the board hadn't been secure for 10 years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=145.9s)]
*  And just give me the money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=148.22s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=149.22s)]
*  When Joe Biden became president three years ago, he inherited the lowest rate of illegal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=150.46s)]
*  immigration in 45 years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=155.14s)]
*  He had made incredible progress securing the border, and Joe Biden deliberately systematically [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=158.3s)]
*  dismantled it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=164.4s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers, we went from the lowest rate in 45 years to right now today, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  the highest rate of illegal immigration in history ever. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=170.78s)]
*  9.6 million illegal immigrants have come in under Joe Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=175.34s)]
*  And here's the thing to understand. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  He's not unhappy about that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=181.78s)]
*  He doesn't want to solve it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't want to prevent it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  He wants more. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=186.18s)]
*  It was a deliberate decision. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=187.94s)]
*  And when he asked for more money, it's not more money to build a wall. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=190.02s)]
*  It's not more money to secure the border. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  He wants more money to process illegal immigrants faster, to move even more of them into every [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=195.22s)]
*  city in America. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=201.78s)]
*  He wants to take that 9.6 million and make it 20 million, make it 30 million, make it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=202.78s)]
*  40 million. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=208.14s)]
*  It is an invasion. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=209.14s)]
*  And Texas is bearing the brunt, but every community in America is paying the price. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=210.5s)]
*  You went the longest in terms of any one candidate back in 2016 against Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=215.82s)]
*  I believe it ended after Indiana. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=221.9s)]
*  You had won Wisconsin, if my memory serves me properly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=223.7s)]
*  It was—you went further than anybody. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=227.7s)]
*  You see what's happening here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=229.82s)]
*  You see these latest poll numbers out of New Hampshire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=231.1s)]
*  I'd be shocked to believe that all of these polls that have Trump up by, you know, 18, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=233.42s)]
*  19, 20-plus points are going to be that far off. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=239.38s)]
*  He'll win by five points, but it still would be a big victory for him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=244.38s)]
*  What happens after that? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=248.02s)]
*  Would Nikki Haley risk going into her home state where she's down 30 points and losing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=249.1s)]
*  her home state? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=253.24s)]
*  Look, I think this race is over. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=254.24s)]
*  Last week on your show, I endorsed Donald Trump, and the reason I endorsed Donald Trump [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=257.22s)]
*  is I think he's won the primary. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=261.58s)]
*  The results in Iowa were overwhelming. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=262.98s)]
*  I stayed out of it to let the voters speak. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=265.7s)]
*  You look at what happened in Iowa. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=268.26s)]
*  He won over 51 percent of the vote. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=269.58s)]
*  He won 98 out of 99 counties. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=272.22s)]
*  That is overwhelming. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=275.72s)]
*  That is a powerful outcome. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Going to New Hampshire, New Hampshire tomorrow, look, Haley is close to Trump in New Hampshire. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=280.3s)]
*  It's possible that Haley will be close. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=285.06s)]
*  It's even possible that she wins in New Hampshire, particularly because New Hampshire allows [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  independents to vote in the primary. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=291.98s)]
*  So about a third of the state are independents. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=293.94000000000005s)]
*  They can show up tomorrow, and on that day, they can decide, do I want to vote Democrat, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  do I want to vote Republican? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=300.62s)]
*  The Boston Globe this weekend wrote an editorial urging every independent, don't vote in the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=301.82s)]
*  Democrat primary, vote in the Republican primary to beat Donald Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  They said, we don't like Nikki Haley, but we hate Donald Trump. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=310.61999999999995s)]
*  So there's a chance Nikki Haley wins tomorrow. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  But whether she does or not, frankly doesn't matter, because after that, it goes to South [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=317.17999999999995s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=321.9s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley will stick around to South Carolina, and she is going to lose her home [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=322.9s)]
*  state by double digits. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  And after that is Super Tuesday, where she's down by huge margins everywhere. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=328.06s)]
*  I think this race is over. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=332.98s)]
*  And so I hope we see the Republican Party come together, unified, beat Joe Biden, because [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=334.98s)]
*  the results of this administration have frankly been a train wreck and a disaster for the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=340.74s)]
*  country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  We're going to get to the president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  He's now taking the stage. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=348.66s)]
*  Very quickly, how do you explain what I call this Trump phenomenon, that he defies all [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=349.9s)]
*  conventional political gravity? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=355.38s)]
*  The old rules of politics obviously don't apply to him. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  If he's arrested, you know, after all that he's been through, people now see this as [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  a persecution, not prosecution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=368.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=370.62s)]
*  Have they just overreached out for the last seven years, and this is the result of it? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=371.62s)]
*  Well, listen, number one, Trump has enormous backbone. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  He's got guts. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=380.5s)]
*  He stands up and fights. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=381.5s)]
*  Number two, he broke the Democrat Party. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=382.66s)]
*  He broke the media. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=385.7s)]
*  They hate him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=386.7s)]
*  And so look, I enjoyed the conversation between you and Newton. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=388.3s)]
*  And Newton was right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDk8G8HuaGw&t=391.54s)]
