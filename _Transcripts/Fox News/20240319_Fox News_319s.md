# Obama remains the 'star:' Tammy Bruce
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk)
*  Apparently, he was there for an informal meeting about his foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=4.4s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, former senior adviser to President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=5.4s)]
*  Trump, Stephen Miller. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=10.76s)]
*  I'm not buying that, Tammy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=11.76s)]
*  Not one bit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=13.64s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=14.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I'll tell you, Biden expects and should expect Obama's support for the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=15.64s)]
*  election. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=21.64s)]
*  Obama's been very vocal that he can—he's going to get his support, he's going to be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=22.64s)]
*  a key part of the campaign. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=25.68s)]
*  He's going to be his main adviser. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=28.0s)]
*  And then he does something that just highlights what Joe Biden can't do, which is swiftly [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=30.0s)]
*  get out of a car, run up to number 10 and Downing Street, have an impromptu meeting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  That's the kind of thing President Biden should be doing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=42.08s)]
*  Or at the very least, Kamala Harris. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  But instead, Obama once again is sucking all the air out of the room. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=47.96s)]
*  With he and Hillary, everybody would need oxygen masks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=53.32000000000001s)]
*  There's just no way around it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=56.6s)]
*  So he remains—Brock Obama remains the star. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=57.96s)]
*  He is acting as though he is some kind of shadow government. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  And you know, there's maybe a few reasons. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=66.2s)]
*  The prime minister in England is having his own problems. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=68.6s)]
*  The conservatives in England are having problems finding, you know, a leader that they can [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=70.88s)]
*  stick with. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=75.28s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=76.44s)]
*  But the fact is, is that you've got a dynamic where Obama already—I don't know about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=77.76s)]
*  this internal, intranessine fight, because when Biden was elected, he told Axios, 90 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=82.84s)]
*  percent of the folks who were there in my administration, they are continuing and building [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  on the policies we talked about. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  So there was this first utterance, effectively saying, 90 percent of the White House is my [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=101.64s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=102.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if Biden really thinks that he's running the country or who's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=103.84s)]
*  in charge here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  But he said—also, Obama said that Biden was going to, quote, finish the job that Obama [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=110.0s)]
*  had started. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, if he's finishing the job, it apparently involves finishing this country off. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  That would be the net result in 231 days, God forbid, if he ever got reelected. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=122.76s)]
*  Never underestimate Joe Biden's ability to F things up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=128.96s)]
*  Stephen Miller, guess who said that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=136.36s)]
*  Well, of course, that was famously said by former President Barack Obama. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=138.12s)]
*  And that prediction has very sadly borne out every single day of the past three-plus years. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  As bad as Obama was as a president, he was a shining exemplar of competency and skill, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=153.8s)]
*  compared to the nightmare that we are living through every single day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=162.28000000000003s)]
*  Towers breaking out all over the world, violence spilling out on our streets, inflation out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=166.96s)]
*  of control, and a border that is so open you have illegal aliens from over 100 countries [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=172.24s)]
*  pouring in by the thousands every single day, uninterrupted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  And I also suspect that you see President Obama going to the UK today because Obama [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  believes that he, not Biden, can better steer the foreign policy of the United States. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=190.88s)]
*  So I don't buy for one second that that meeting was anything else than President Obama telling [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  the UK what he believes should be the foreign policy of America and the United Kingdom, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  whether it be about Iran, whether it be about Russia, whether it be about Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=209.1s)]
*  That's what I think was happening today. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=213.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=214.9s)]
*  Exit question for both of you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=216.38s)]
*  So we keep hearing, Tammy, that Obama and Clinton might hit the campaign trail for and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=217.82s)]
*  with Joe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=223.64s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=224.64s)]
*  Does that make Joe look worse, or does that help Joe? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=225.64s)]
*  I think it makes him look weak and incapable of winning on his own. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=229.55999999999997s)]
*  So somebody else has to do it for him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=233.44s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  And Joe is of the past. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Those people now are of the past. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=238.72s)]
*  But it also—remember, Obama couldn't even drag Hillary across the finish line with an [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=241.22s)]
*  unknown candidate of Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=246.56s)]
*  I mean, he put—he and Michelle had the power of the incumbency, and they couldn't do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=249.0s)]
*  it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=253.6s)]
*  And so, the fact that they're running in to do this proves that they know that they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=254.6s)]
*  have not done the job, that Americans don't like what they see, and they're going to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=257.64s)]
*  try to, I don't know, maybe do some nostalgia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  But my goodness, the Democrats don't want that either. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=263.44s)]
*  It is going to be Trump. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=266.52s)]
*  And it's going to be Trump not because Americans don't know what they're doing, but because [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Americans want a future that they can trust and that they can enjoy and that they believe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=271.44s)]
*  can happen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=276.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=277.68s)]
*  Your answer, Stephen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=278.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=280.4s)]
*  Obama hurts—Obama hurts Biden. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=281.4s)]
*  Every time he's out there, he just underscores how decrepit, how ancient, how frail Joe [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=283.04s)]
*  Biden is, he hurts him just by being on the stage. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=289.6s)]
*  No question. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=292.76s)]
*  Even Bill Clinton has more energy with him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  How many years ago was Clinton president for crying out loud? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=296.92s)]
*  Far more dynamic. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=299.36s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's probably a close second right behind Biden. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=302.36s)]
*  Anyway, straight ahead tonight, news. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJiGbLDvOk&t=305.24s)]
