# Trump attorney: This is not normal and I can't believe what I'm seeing
**Fox News:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q)
*  All right, the left obsessively continues to push forward with their never-ending Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  witch hunts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=5.44s)]
*  Now, earlier today, well, Trump defied the judge overseeing far-left New York attorney [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=6.44s)]
*  general's civil fraud case against him and gave a closing statement of a whopping five [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=11.0s)]
*  minutes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=16.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Fulton County DA Fannie Willis, she continues to come under fire over her [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=17.0s)]
*  alleged romantic relationship with the lead prosecutor. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=20.76s)]
*  In that Trump case, an outside counsel paid over 650 grand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=24.54s)]
*  His name is Nathan Wade. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=28.5s)]
*  According to those court documents, she has been subpoenaed to appear as a witness in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=29.5s)]
*  his divorce proceedings and a new bombshell report from Politico revealing that the January [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=34.58s)]
*  6 committee helped guide the early days of the Trump-Georgia probe, as committee staff [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=40.06s)]
*  quietly met with attorneys and agents working for Fannie Willis in April of 2022. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  Now, besides their steadfast pursuit of more Trump witch hunts, what else did the attorney [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=50.940000000000005s)]
*  general of New York and the DA in Fulton County, Fannie Willis, have in common? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=57.18s)]
*  According to the visitor logs, both visited the Biden White House in the last two years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=61.42s)]
*  Here with reaction, Trump legal spokesperson Alina Hobbit is back with us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=66.7s)]
*  Alina, great to have you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=71.30000000000001s)]
*  Let me see if I have this straight here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=73.38s)]
*  So you have the attorney general in New York meeting with the Biden White House and White [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=74.94s)]
*  House counsel, I assume, or I don't know who. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=81.34s)]
*  Do we know who? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=83.14s)]
*  How many occasions have you identified she was in the Biden White House and what was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=84.3s)]
*  the time frame of that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=89.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=91.82s)]
*  We saw that there was a meeting in August, the month or two right before they filed their [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=93.82s)]
*  complaint, and there was another meeting later in the midst of our litigation on the attorney [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=99.66000000000001s)]
*  general's claim. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=105.5s)]
*  So that is twice confirmed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=106.5s)]
*  I believe there are also reports that she had been at Ms. Kamala Harris's home. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=109.18s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=115.94000000000001s)]
*  She is a New York attorney general voted by the New York constituents, and the only thing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=116.94000000000001s)]
*  they all have in common is the Soros backing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=123.22s)]
*  I cannot understand why she would have cause in the middle of a trial to go see the White [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=126.06s)]
*  House and the Biden administration, let alone the top. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=132.1s)]
*  One of the records said that they met on the front lawn. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=135.58s)]
*  I can't believe what I'm seeing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=138.22s)]
*  I really can't. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=140.9s)]
*  And I am with you, Sean, reporting with you every day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=141.94s)]
*  I am in the weeds and I still am shocked. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=145.46s)]
*  They cease to amaze me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=148.58s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=150.46s)]
*  I thought Georgia was bad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  And then today I have to sit in court and get notice that this person has now weaponized [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=153.02s)]
*  her, which we already knew. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=159.18s)]
*  But now that she's coordinating as well with the Biden administration, what was she there [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=161.02s)]
*  for? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=166.3s)]
*  Coffee? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=167.3s)]
*  We don't believe it anymore. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=168.3s)]
*  And the joke of this is this whole case is pending on the idea of whether or not valuations [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=170.3s)]
*  that, by the way, you have a disclaimer, the Trump organization had a disclaimer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=174.94s)]
*  People use their valuations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=179.58s)]
*  Any company lending money, any company giving insurance, they have a fiduciary responsibility [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  to do their own valuation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=187.02s)]
*  So it's a moot point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=188.86s)]
*  There's not a single person that's been aggrieved in this case. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=189.86s)]
*  You have no complaint from anybody, no lender, no insurance company. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=192.34s)]
*  I mean, it's absurd on its face. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=196.78s)]
*  They want to seem to seemingly fulfill the campaign promise to go after one man, Donald [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump, one family, the Trump family, one organization, the Trump organization, and completely cancel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=204.46s)]
*  them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=209.62s)]
*  And then you've got Fannie Willis meeting with the January 6th committee and then an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=210.62s)]
*  outside counsel she's hiring and taking extravagant vacations with. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=214.9s)]
*  Well, she met with the J-6 committee and both of them went to the Biden White House. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=218.94s)]
*  And by the way, he charged Fulton County for the hours that he was there with Fannie Willis [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  at the Biden White House. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=229.06s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=230.38s)]
*  Can you imagine a world where you're trying to be corrupt and then you bill your time [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  to the corruption? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what planet are we living in? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, the stupidity is amazing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=240.82s)]
*  If it proves to be true, I really got to get popcorn at this point. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=243.06s)]
*  But it's not a joke, Sean. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=247.5s)]
*  These are real people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=249.3s)]
*  The Trump Organization paid over $300 million in taxes over the past few years to employees. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=250.66s)]
*  This is about people that work in the company. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  This is about the kids who won't be able to get a mortgage and won't be able to take [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=259.62s)]
*  out a car loan because Miss James and people like her had a political agenda. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=263.14s)]
*  It's not a question of fact. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=268.1s)]
*  It is a fact. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=269.82000000000005s)]
*  There is video footage of it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  And like I said today in court, not one piece after three years of investigation, not one [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  piece after 11 weeks shows that any of them committed fraud. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=278.36s)]
*  All that it shows is one thing, desperation and election interference. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=282.42s)]
*  It is pathetic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  It is obvious. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  And the American people get it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  Listen, you're not meeting with the Biden DOJ. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  You're meeting with the Bidens. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  You're meeting with Kamala herself in her home. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=295.46s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=298.26s)]
*  And when is our country going to stop talking about it and start doing something about it? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=299.52s)]
*  Because they have no problem doing something about it when it's Trump. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=303.94s)]
*  If the case is mostly based on valuations and they're implying that President Trump [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=308.38s)]
*  put in valuations that were not accurate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=314.02s)]
*  But yet you have a judge in the case that's clinging to the idiotic, completely moronic [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=317.14s)]
*  view that Mar-a-Lago is worth a mere $18 million. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=322.98s)]
*  I mean, he would be more guilty of anything that's even being alleged against the Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=327.74s)]
*  organization. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=332.78s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=333.78s)]
*  Sean, he should get damages for how much he's been prosecuted and how many years he's had [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=335.14s)]
*  to pay for lawyers and defending these garbage claims. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=340.14s)]
*  He should get damages. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=344.22s)]
*  Okay, I can tell you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=345.9s)]
*  I know a little bit about Florida real estate now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=348.26s)]
*  That property is worth closer to a billion than $18 million. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=351.22s)]
*  You can't even make this up in a novel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=355.22s)]
*  But it's sad that's justice in America and it's not working. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  Alina Hobbit, thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsg7lYXvG0Q&t=360.70000000000005s)]
