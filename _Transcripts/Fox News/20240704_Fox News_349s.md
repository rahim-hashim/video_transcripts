# Gianno Caldwell: We canâ€™t survive four more months under Biden
**Fox News:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=0.0s)]
*  As Democrats rush to save Joe Biden's ailing campaign, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=4.08s)]
*  it's inflation and lawlessness that could be the real downfall come November. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=7.92s)]
*  According to a new survey, the cost of a Fourth of July cookout has reached a record high, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  up another 5% since last year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=19.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, an illegal immigrant accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in Massachusetts earlier this year [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=22.16s)]
*  has been released on just a $500 bail. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=29.84s)]
*  $500. That's it. So offensive. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=33.28s)]
*  Despite calls from ICE to transfer him to their custody, wouldn't do it. They didn't do it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=36.56s)]
*  This, as more disturbing details are revealed in the alleged murder of Jocelyn Nungare [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=43.44s)]
*  by illegal immigrants, as her family confirms that she was sexually assaulted before she was killed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Here now with reaction, The Big Money Show co-host Brian Brenberg and Fox News political [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=57.2s)]
*  analyst and founder of the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety, Gianno Caldwell. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=61.84s)]
*  Let's tackle the most difficult, hardest one first, Gianno. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=67.28s)]
*  You're deeply involved and engaged in this idea of fighting back against crime. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=71.2s)]
*  I see these horrific crimes happening, $500 bail and DAs that aren't willing to go after [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=76.8s)]
*  and prosecute these people to the fullest extent of the law. What's your take on this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. And there's one man who's created a majority of this chaos we've [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=87.28s)]
*  seen in the country. That name is George Soros. And that's why I came up with the Caldwell [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=92.24s)]
*  Institute for Public Safety, because we need to fight back against these sanctuary city policies [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=96.08s)]
*  and some state policies that do it as well. We need to fight back against these no bail laws, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=101.12s)]
*  and we need to hold these people accountable, whether they be migrants or whether they be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=106.0s)]
*  citizens who've chosen to commit these crimes and realize because of George Soros and these [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=110.64s)]
*  progressive prosecutors, there's no accountability. We have to fight as citizens, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=115.28s)]
*  and I encourage people to join me at CaldwellInstitute.org as we do this work. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=120.16s)]
*  I'm going to tell you, my heart goes out to the citizens who continue to lose their lives [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  in our country due to this migrant crime. It's so sad. All right, I've got to shift gears [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=131.12s)]
*  here a little bit. Brian, you're one of the smartest, best political analysts I know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=137.2s)]
*  You're super smart. I love your show. Quick, tell me, what's the Joe Biden plan to tackle inflation? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=142.32s)]
*  I'm not like a fortune teller. He doesn't have a plan to tackle inflation. He doesn't have a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=151.44s)]
*  plan to get through the next week, Jason. I mean, that's the problem, whether it's the border or [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=156.16s)]
*  it's inflation or crime or whatever, these guys can't figure out if he's sentient enough to be the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=160.64s)]
*  president. There's no way he's going to be able to solve these difficult problems. But the fact is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=166.8s)]
*  most of it is common sense, actually. You enforce the law. If ICE wants to take somebody to custody, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  you work with them. And if you want to solve inflation, quit spending everybody else's money [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=178.4s)]
*  through the government and get this federal reserve to pull back on money a little bit, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=183.52s)]
*  and you'd be okay. But if the president can't figure out if he's going to survive the week, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  he's not going to figure out how to solve the nation's real problems. And that's a tragedy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=193.28s)]
*  with all this. Yes. And Gianno, elections are about the future. I don't know that the president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=197.36s)]
*  hasn't planned it to lock down on immigration or solve our safety problems. I mean, more importantly, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=203.28s)]
*  to Brian's point, we don't know if he's going to be around in the next week. Kamala Harris doesn't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=210.24s)]
*  have a plan. She was the border czar, and she failed at that mission, leaving a lot of us at risk. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=214.72s)]
*  This administration has to go. We cannot survive four more months with them, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=220.72s)]
*  let alone talking about four more years. This is the president, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=224.64s)]
*  and he's not a president at this point. He's an empty suit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=227.92s)]
*  Brian, the idea that Kamala Harris, the vice president, she was tasked with two things, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=233.04s)]
*  artificial intelligence and dealing with, you know, in addition to obviously her space ads, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=238.32s)]
*  the stuff that she was going to do with those paid kid actors. But she was supposed to be the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=244.48s)]
*  borders czar and she just radio silence, nothing. Well, it was worse than radio silence. We actually [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=249.12s)]
*  got stuff out of her mouth. She talked about addressing root causes. I mean, how about just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=256.72s)]
*  some natural intelligence out of this administration? Forget about our artificial intelligence. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=262.24s)]
*  Just give me something that makes sense. Kamala Harris, if it's possible, is worse than Joe Biden [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=267.2s)]
*  right now because she's never had a track record of anything except for dodging and saying things [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=273.84s)]
*  that don't make sense. But Democrats are in a box because if they don't go with her, they're going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  to violate all their own principles because they're not going to check all the right boxes. And that's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  again, that's a tragedy for America because what we need more than anything right now is competence. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's the one thing these guys can't deliver. That's exactly right. You've taken the words right [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  out of my mouth. I think what America is looking for more than anything at this point, it's not [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=304.24s)]
*  identity politics. It's not all this rigmarole. The reason Donald Trump is surging is because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=309.52s)]
*  they're looking for competence to deal with the issues that are right in their plate every single [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=316.08s)]
*  day. And that's where the Biden Harris administration and the Democrats totally fail. Brian Brenberg, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=321.12s)]
*  Gianno Caldwell, congratulations on the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety. Really, really good [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUkOoKF1Wn4&t=327.6s)]
