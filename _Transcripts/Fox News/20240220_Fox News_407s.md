# Hannity: This is alarming for the Biden campaign
**Fox News:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc)
*  And welcome to Hannity we are reporting live tonight from Tucson, Arizona [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=0.0s)]
*  So in just four short days former President Trump and Nikki Haley [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=3.64s)]
*  They will square off in the South Carolina Republican primary and according to the polls President Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, he'll holds a commanding lead a new suffix poll shows him leading Nikki Haley by 28 points in her home state [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Now bringing his lead now in the real clear politics average to over 25 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=20.8s)]
*  Now it would be natural for things to tighten in the days leading into any primary that's common now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  Despite facing a huge deficit in her home state Nikki Haley delivered a speech earlier today [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=31.56s)]
*  Announcing she will not be dropping out of this race anytime soon [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=37.68s)]
*  So far governor Haley has been struggling versus the former president after coming in third in Iowa [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=41.68s)]
*  Losing by double digits in New Hampshire and losing to the option quote none of these candidates by more than 30 points in Nevada [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=47.44s)]
*  Well, the pressure certainly on the former governor in her home state now [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=55.08s)]
*  Fair question must be asked if she doesn't win her home state on Saturday or if she even loses by double digits [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=59.32s)]
*  Where does she see a path to the nomination? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=66.48s)]
*  Certainly the pressure is on governor Haley tonight [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=69.44s)]
*  But despite an enormous lead in the polls President Trump continues to campaign vigorously and earlier tonight [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=72.16s)]
*  He sat down with our very own Laura Ingram for a town hall in South Carolina [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=78.28s)]
*  Now the two covered a number of topics including a possible surprise campaign strategy based off a shocking new poll watch this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=82.88s)]
*  You may campaign in the Bronx or at Madison Square Garden [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  When might that be happening very soon? Look we have nine months yet, but I'm gonna [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  See about Madison Square Garden and we're gonna go to the South Bronx and we're gonna go to Queens and other areas because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=103.24s)]
*  If you look at what's happened in New York, I'm not even blaming the mayor [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  I think the mayor has sort of been told to take a backseat a little bit because they came after him violently [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=112.08s)]
*  You know they came after him like they're gonna indict him when he started speaking up and now he's become quiet [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=116.48s)]
*  These are fascists. We're dealing with they're terrible people and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=121.4s)]
*  So I'm not blaming him. I'm just saying we have 400 500 thousand [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=124.88s)]
*  Migrants illegal migrants in New York on Madison Avenue. They're sleeping on Madison Avenue. They're sleeping on Fifth Avenue. It's horrible [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=128.88s)]
*  What's going on? I think there's a chance to win New York. The people are very very unhappy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=135.68s)]
*  Now we'll have more on that New York poll in just a moment and as the left continues to pursue their endless witch hunts [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=140.12s)]
*  Laura did ask the former president if he's worried about becoming a political prisoner. Here's what he said [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  We are turning into a communist country in many ways. And if you look at it, I'm the leading candidate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=154.08s)]
*  I get in that I never heard of being indicted before I was gonna I got indicted four times [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  I have eight or nine trials all because of the fact that I'm and you know this all because of the fact that I'm in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=165.32s)]
*  Politics they indicted me on things that are so ridiculous [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=171.6s)]
*  Do you see yourself as a potential? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Political prisoner in the United States because that's their goal is to put you in jail behind your bars [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=179.32s)]
*  Wait to the rest of the rest of your life if I were losing in the polls [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=185.16s)]
*  They wouldn't even be talking about me and I wouldn't have had any legal fees [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=189.04s)]
*  If you had retired from politics with all these if I were out I think although they hate me so much [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=192.74s)]
*  I'm I think if I got out there still let's pursue this guy. We can't stand this guy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=197.22s)]
*  And while Trump continues to surge well Joe Biden struggles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=202.58s)]
*  They're only growing more apparent now earlier today when walking up the small stairs not the big stairs on the Air Force one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=206.8s)]
*  Well, he once again appeared to stumble before actually catching himself now despite the obvious struggles [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  According to one New York Times publisher the White House is quote extremely upset with the paper's coverage of Biden's age and unpopularity [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=220.54s)]
*  Does the Biden White House really expect even their willing accomplices their allies and the media mob? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Do they really expect them to ignore? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=237.58s)]
*  What are the obvious daily struggles of what is a very weak frail and cognitively? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=239.94s)]
*  Compromised president is that what they expect now unfortunately for the White House Biden's failures and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  Freefall in poll numbers cannot be hidden now according to a new mom and survey Biden's approval rating is an unmitigated [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=251.78s)]
*  disaster with just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=259.66s)]
*  38% of respondents now approving of Joe and the job [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=261.26s)]
*  He's done as president and when you dive into those numbers well [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=264.82s)]
*  It only gets worse on the issue of inflation which as all of you know has been one of the cornerstones of quote [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=268.2s)]
*  Vydenomics well running completely out of control since he took office only [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=275.18s)]
*  34% approve of his job performance and after dealing with the fallout of his open borders policy for over three years [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=280.7s)]
*  Which has wreaked nothing but havoc across every corner of our country [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  Well just 26% approve of his performance on the issue of immigration, but he's still blaming Trump [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  What a joke but perhaps most alarming for the Biden campaign is a new poll out of deep blue [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=298.34s)]
*  New York my former home state which shows Joe of just 12 points on Donald Trump [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=304.7s)]
*  Receiving under 50% this is one of the most liberal states in the country now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=312.32s)]
*  This is a state that Joe Biden by won by well over 20 points in 2020 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=317.98s)]
*  Securing over 60% of the vote at the time [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=323.0s)]
*  So what does all of this mean for Joe Biden as the 2024 campaign cycle now heats up? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  No, it's certainly not good a Gallup report from last Friday. It says political and economic indicators [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=331.97999999999996s)]
*  They are quote not promising for Biden that's stating the obvious in fact the report goes on to say well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  presidents with approval ratings of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=345.7s)]
*  50% or higher close to Election Day they've all been reelected all but one president with a sub 50% approval rating lost [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=348.06s)]
*  So in the last Gallup poll from January well, what was Joe's approval rating there? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, it was 41% [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=362.06s)]
*  Not even close to 50. So with Biden's poll numbers continuing to plummet alarm bells [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  They are sounding out for Democrats [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  It's like you got alarms going, you know 24 7 and frankly rightfully so and yet another bad omen for Biden [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=374.26s)]
*  Well, you have 538 snake silver [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=381.02s)]
*  He wrote a pretty scathing piece about the Biden campaign yesterday saying in part quote [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=383.46s)]
*  He's losing now and there's no plan to fix the problems other than hoping that the polls are wrong [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXHcH6EdZc&t=388.38s)]
