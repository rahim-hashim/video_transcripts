# 'READY, WILLING, ABLE': Mel Gibson on 'Ambassador to Hollywood' appointment
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE)
*  Anyway, here tonight, legendary actor, director, our friend Mel Gibson is back, who is out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=0.0s)]
*  with a gripping new thriller. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=5.22s)]
*  I've liked every movie Mel's ever made, to be very honest with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=6.72s)]
*  At the top of my list, The Passion of the Christ. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=10.44s)]
*  Anyway, it's called Flight Risk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=12.84s)]
*  Sir, how are you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=15.08s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=17.06s)]
*  I'm good, Sean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=18.06s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=19.06s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=21.1s)]
*  First of all, I'm really sorry for you, for all the people in California, all that you've [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=22.1s)]
*  had to live through. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=27.9s)]
*  Also, congratulations on your appointment by President Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, you come with nothing, you go with nothing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=33.18s)]
*  Everything in between is just a bumpy adventure, right, Sean? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  I'm living in gratitude. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=39.86s)]
*  Trump said he did, I found out I was some kind of ambassador at the same time as you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=42.62s)]
*  did, probably on a tweet. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=46.86s)]
*  So I was surprised, but hey, I'm ready, willing and able to be of service in any way I can. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=48.82s)]
*  You, Sly, and John Voight, three of my—I don't love a lot of people in Hollywood, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=56.26s)]
*  I'm going to be blunt, but you're three of my favorite people out there and three [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=61.26s)]
*  of the best people in the industry. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=64.74s)]
*  So I thought it was funny when I read, you did not get a phone call about it, you just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=66.64s)]
*  heard about it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=72.22s)]
*  I read it, I think it was The Hollywood Reporter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=73.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=75.66s)]
*  Well, I think Trump shoots from the hip, you know, and—but hey, I'm here to be of service, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=76.66s)]
*  you know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=83.74s)]
*  Yeah, good for you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=84.74s)]
*  And I know Sly feels the same way and John Voight feels the same way as well, and I think [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=86.5s)]
*  the three of you actually can really help. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=90.86s)]
*  The film industry has been hurt in so many different ways, in part because of rules and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  regulations and high taxes, like so many other liberal democratic states. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  How bad has it been? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=103.94s)]
*  You've been living through these wildfires. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  You read about hydrants that don't have water, you read about cutting firefighters' budgets, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=108.5s)]
*  you read about reservoirs that are empty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's got to be frustrating. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=115.78s)]
*  Well, it is, and this confluence of events coming together, there are those who say, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  hey, they must have done it on purpose. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=124.42s)]
*  I won't go that far. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=125.94s)]
*  But if they didn't do it on purpose, I think they certainly facilitated it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  And I am—you know, my heart goes out to all the other residents. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=131.1s)]
*  You meet people all the time who've lost their homes, and you know, you talk and commiserate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=135.88s)]
*  and buck each other up, and everyone's putting on a brave face. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  There are a good bunch out here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=143.66s)]
*  I'm glad Trump's here at the moment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like Daddy arrived, and he's taking his belt off, you know? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=150.38s)]
*  So I think he'll get some results here quickly. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=153.5s)]
*  And you know, as far as being an ambassador goes, I think, you know, looking at tax incentives, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  I know Newsom gave some tax incentives, but maybe not enough because it's still not working. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=164.33999999999997s)]
*  And there are other things that offset that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=170.9s)]
*  I mean, I had to shoot a film for one day in L.A., and it was cheaper for me to take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=173.5s)]
*  the whole crew and fly them to Europe and shoot for three days, lodge them, fly them, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=179.78s)]
*  everything than it was to shoot one day just down the road. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  So there's something wrong there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=190.3s)]
*  And I think there are solutions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  I know Arnold tried to level a playing field years ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  He couldn't do it because there were, you know, there were obstacles. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=197.22s)]
*  He tried, though. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=202.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, I look at this, and I mean, it kind of was a big deal, at least in my world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm nowhere at the level that you are in terms of celebrity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  But when I left New York, I was kind of shocked that there was so much news about it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=215.74s)]
*  And I did make a bold statement. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=221.38s)]
*  I said, I'm sick of the crime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=223.06s)]
*  I'm sick of horrible schools. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm sick of high taxes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=226.14s)]
*  I'm sick of burdensome regulation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm sick of, you know, woke everything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sick of the violence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=232.38s)]
*  And I made a decision. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=234.18s)]
*  I cut the cord. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=235.9s)]
*  I cut it hard. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=236.9s)]
*  And I left. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=237.9s)]
*  And I have no intention of ever going back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=238.9s)]
*  But you stay in California. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, a lot of people have left, and I don't blame them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and they leave for the same reasons that you've just mentioned. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=250.18s)]
*  You know, it didn't suit them anymore. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=254.1s)]
*  Even, you know, people who were liberal, it didn't suit them anymore. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=256.18s)]
*  But if everybody leaves, what's going to happen? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=260.86s)]
*  Well, I can tell you what's happening. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=263.86s)]
*  You know what Andrew Cuomo famously said in New York? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=267.58s)]
*  He goes, tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=270.94s)]
*  We did. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  God forbid the rich leave. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  And you know what's happening? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=277.34s)]
*  I am in South Florida. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=279.58s)]
*  They keep talking about Wall Street South. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=281.06s)]
*  All of these big equity, private equity firms and banks, they're all moving at least half [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=284.54s)]
*  of their offices down here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=290.06s)]
*  And it's helping the state of Florida, I think the free state of Florida. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=292.26s)]
*  And it's increasing the amount of money they have for infrastructure, the amount of money [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=296.98s)]
*  they have to help people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=302.3s)]
*  You don't have the problems that you're plagued with in big cities like L.A., San Francisco, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=304.62s)]
*  New York and Chicago. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=309.02s)]
*  I mean, it kind of makes sense. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=310.34s)]
*  As now an ambassador for Hollywood, you know, what is your message for the mayor? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=313.26s)]
*  It's, you know, keep the kids on the farm, you know, and be competitive with the rest [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=318.62s)]
*  of the world. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=326.62s)]
*  I mean, we're just going, like what you said with Wall Street and everything else, we're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=327.62s)]
*  going somewhere else because it's more cost effective. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=331.97999999999996s)]
*  There's just a lot of prohibitive regulations and things in the way that I think could be [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=335.5s)]
*  lifted. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=339.78s)]
*  But, you know, I'll talk with the guys about that later and get more specific. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=340.78s)]
*  And I have to educate myself on that more, too. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=345.3s)]
*  But I think it can be fixed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=348.66s)]
*  Tell me, go ahead. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=352.26s)]
*  Why not? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=353.98s)]
*  Tell me about flight risk. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=357.9s)]
*  My understanding is you have in the works maybe a sequel to The Passion of the Christ, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=360.46s)]
*  which I'm very interested in if that happens. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=366.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, flight risk is, hey, it's fast and it's fun. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  It's entertainment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  And people have been going to see it and texting me and saying they're digging it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=376.7s)]
*  So, hey, I'm happy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=381.34s)]
*  Because it's like anything. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Jb7yv0UVE&t=383.09999999999997s)]
