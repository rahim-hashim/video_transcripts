# Vivek Ramaswamy: Trump is on a path to ‘mop the floor with Biden’
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw)
*  Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, great to have you back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=3.6s)]
*  Let me start first with this issue about Biden. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=5.92s)]
*  Biden comes out at this hastily called news conference. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=8.76s)]
*  You saw it, I saw it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=12.08s)]
*  And it's all, he's mad and he's furious [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=13.8s)]
*  that special counsel Herr pointed out [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=16.64s)]
*  that he didn't even remember the year [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=19.72s)]
*  he became vice president, when he started, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=21.04s)]
*  when it finished, on numerous occasions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=23.0s)]
*  And that he didn't even remember [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  within a few years when his son died. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=27.04s)]
*  How in the hell he dare, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=29.24s)]
*  how in the hell dare he raise that, his words. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=31.56s)]
*  Frankly, when I was asked the question, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=34.4s)]
*  I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=36.12s)]
*  They never asked. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=41.56s)]
*  Well look, on one hand, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=42.44s)]
*  he brought it up on his own. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=43.28s)]
*  On one hand, you have a president [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  who they say is too senile to stand trial. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=46.92s)]
*  Well, on the other hand, they say he's perfectly fine [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  to run the United States of America. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=51.4s)]
*  Those two things can't make sense at the same time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=53.2s)]
*  But I want to point out something, Sean, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=55.82s)]
*  which is that we have known about Biden's senility [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=57.06s)]
*  and mental frailties for a long time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=59.86s)]
*  The fact that the mainstream media [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=62.580000000000005s)]
*  and even the democratic establishment [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  is now picking up on this, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=65.48s)]
*  signals to me that they are getting ready [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=67.22s)]
*  to move him out of the way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  And precisely because Donald Trump is on the path [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  to mop the floor with Joe Biden this fall. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=76.22s)]
*  That's why I think there's a very good chance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  it's not going to be Joe Biden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  So we have to be skating to where the puck is going, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=80.98s)]
*  not just where it is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=82.98s)]
*  One step ahead, we can fall into the temptation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=84.36s)]
*  of thinking the Democratic Party is as silly stupid [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=86.88s)]
*  as Joe Biden appears to be on a given day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=90.0s)]
*  That's actually not the case. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=92.32s)]
*  They're actually one step ahead, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=93.5s)]
*  and I believe they are planning [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  to replace Joe Biden quietly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=96.36s)]
*  And I think this is just one more step [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=98.64s)]
*  in leading us there for us to be prepared [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=100.24s)]
*  to really have a much more competitive race this fall [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  than it appears at the margin. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=105.08s)]
*  Listen, I think it's definitely possible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=107.08s)]
*  I mean, you can't have somebody this cognitively compromised. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=108.88s)]
*  By the way, a credit to this show, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=111.88s)]
*  we've been pointing it out since the last election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=114.2s)]
*  And by the way, back then he looks lucid [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=117.44s)]
*  and with it compared to where he is today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=119.92s)]
*  The decline has been that significant. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=122.68s)]
*  We've shown people the tape. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=124.4s)]
*  If you believe that, then who is likely to replace him? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=125.98s)]
*  Look, I think they have a major Kamala Harris problem [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=130.84s)]
*  because this is a party that is tied its very identity [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=133.24s)]
*  to identity politics. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=136.44s)]
*  She only got the job, let's be very honest, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=138.06s)]
*  because of her race and gender. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=139.96s)]
*  I know you're not supposed to say that, but it's the truth. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=141.68s)]
*  If they're gonna move Joe Biden out of the way, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=144.2s)]
*  but they don't want Kamala Harris in that seat. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about Democratic identity politics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=146.64s)]
*  That is a known fact of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=148.84s)]
*  That's the core. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=151.12s)]
*  And they know that Kamala Harris cannot be the nominee. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=152.44s)]
*  And so they have to have somebody who checks off [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=155.56s)]
*  one of those identitarian boxes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  So that's why I think it's not gonna be Gavin Newsom, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  whether it's Michelle Obama to Hillary Clinton [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=162.6s)]
*  to somebody else, it has to be somebody who checks off [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=164.76s)]
*  their temple of identity politics box. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=167.34s)]
*  But I do think that that is where we're headed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  and it's important for Republicans not to be complacent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  Right now, President Trump would run laps [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=174.92s)]
*  around Joe Biden. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  This could be a Reagan style landslide. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  You look at that survey of independent voters [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=180.2s)]
*  and that focus group that tells you the same story [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  I am seeing across this country, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=184.22s)]
*  which is precisely because why I believe [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=186.0s)]
*  they're gonna actually change it to someone [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  other than Biden by the time we get to this summer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay, now I have no reason not to believe David Axelrod, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=192.64s)]
*  but he was pretty strong in a statement saying [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  Michelle's not running. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=199.26s)]
*  Okay, that then brings up the Gavin Newsom issue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=200.64s)]
*  I've interviewed him, I have pressed him, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=204.0s)]
*  I pressed him in the debate with Governor DeSantis [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  on the issue of if he'd run. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=208.92s)]
*  He's been very clear that he's not next in line, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  that the person that would be next in line [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=213.16s)]
*  would be the Vice President Harris. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so how do you push her out of the way [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=217.56s)]
*  and maybe go to Gavin if he would take it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=222.98s)]
*  taking him at his word that he said [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=226.0s)]
*  he really wouldn't take it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=227.44s)]
*  Then you gotta look at Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=229.84s)]
*  It's interesting that they are pushing out a book [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=231.32s)]
*  is my understanding. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=233.32s)]
*  Over the summer, that seemed to be kind of spontaneous. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=235.08s)]
*  You think maybe she's been talked to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=238.36s)]
*  or spoken to by people? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=239.84s)]
*  Well, the reality is even Hillary Clinton [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=242.62s)]
*  is now lightly criticizing Joe Biden. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=244.02s)]
*  God knows she wants the job. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=245.96s)]
*  I don't necessarily take David Axelrod at his word. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=247.72s)]
*  I do think that it may not even be Michelle Obama's choice. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=249.94s)]
*  The idea that just because she doesn't wanna run [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=252.7s)]
*  doesn't mean they're gonna make her the nominee. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=254.72s)]
*  I think are two separate and different questions. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=256.68s)]
*  But whatever it is, Sean, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=259.1s)]
*  this is our moment to get ahead of that curve, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=259.98s)]
*  not to play a guessing game. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=261.66s)]
*  I think the Republicans right now have an opportunity [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=263.26s)]
*  to own the message of national unity, seal that border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  Democrat or Republican, most Americans agree [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=269.86s)]
*  on its importance. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=272.1s)]
*  Black or white, man or woman, it doesn't matter. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=273.18s)]
*  We agree, nations have borders. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=275.3s)]
*  Merit beats DEI. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=277.54s)]
*  That we gotta drill more, frack more. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=279.18s)]
*  Own the actual issues that allow us to unite this country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  And the more we get ahead of that curve, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=284.9s)]
*  the more we say that we own the message of national unity. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=286.44s)]
*  Not Joe Biden who claimed to unite the country, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=289.04s)]
*  but we the Republican party do that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=290.9s)]
*  To make America great again, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=292.84s)]
*  we have to make America one nation again. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=294.2s)]
*  That America first includes all Americans. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  The more we embrace that message in advance, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=299.44s)]
*  the less it matters if it's Michelle Obama [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=302.04s)]
*  or Hillary Clinton or anybody else. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=303.92s)]
*  So I'm not a believer of waiting for the other side [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=305.88s)]
*  to make their decisions and then responding. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=307.68s)]
*  Let's set our own agenda, national unity as our own message. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=309.72s)]
*  I think Donald Trump has the ability to deliver on that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=313.84s)]
*  And that way, either way, he will be victorious this fall [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=316.96s)]
*  as I'm keen to make sure we accomplish. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=319.96s)]
*  I mentioned the nearly 10 million unvetted Joe Biden, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=322.64s)]
*  illegal immigrants coming from our top geopolitical foes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  Tens of thousands of them from these countries. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  And Biden and even Mitt Romney [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  find their comments repulsive. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  Biden saying that House Republicans [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=337.44s)]
*  should reject Trump's dangerous quote, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  un-American pro-Putin stance on Ukraine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=342.88s)]
*  No, it's not a pro-Putin stance to say [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  that this is the biggest national security threat, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=349.38s)]
*  your wide open borders that is allowing people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  from Iran, Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan, China, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  and Russia into the country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Sorry, secure the border, get your budget in balance. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=361.88s)]
*  Then we can talk about aid. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  First, I talk about Israel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=367.02s)]
*  Ukraine already got 75 billion. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=368.84s)]
*  And we cannot be fighting a proxy war [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=371.84s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin and Russia [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=374.0s)]
*  unless maybe we want Russia to get more aggressive. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=375.88s)]
*  That is a potential outcome also. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=379.96s)]
*  Well, look, I think that we are marching [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  closer to World War III than we ever have been [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=384.88s)]
*  in my lifetime, driving Russia further into China's arms, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=386.96s)]
*  which unfortunately nobody in either party [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=390.46s)]
*  is really talking about. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=392.08s)]
*  But you're right, the top threat we face is the invasion, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  and I will call it that, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  the invasion at our own southern border. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=397.08s)]
*  If that disaster can happen on October 7th in Israel, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=399.48s)]
*  it could happen right here at home [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=402.4s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=403.84s)]
*  And God forbid we learn that the hard way. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=405.66s)]
*  So this should not be a Democrat versus Republican issue. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=407.92s)]
*  And this idea that we need a new law, Sean, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=410.52s)]
*  is also a farce. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=412.74s)]
*  Remain in Mexico is currently technically [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=414.16s)]
*  the law of the land. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=416.92s)]
*  You just have Biden and Mayorkas [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=418.04s)]
*  refusing to actually enforce the law. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=419.8s)]
*  So that's where I wanna see Republicans [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=422.52s)]
*  in both the House and the Senate [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=423.8s)]
*  actually stand with a spine, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=425.32s)]
*  to say that it's not just how much more money [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=427.08s)]
*  you send to the border. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=428.68s)]
*  It is a demand that as table stakes [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=429.92s)]
*  for even having any other discussion about foreign aid, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=431.96s)]
*  we have to make sure we are enforcing the laws [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  that are already on the books. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=437.24s)]
*  We don't need new laws, we need a new president [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  who actually enforces the law. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=441.72s)]
*  That's not Joe Biden, it's gonna be Donald Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=443.56s)]
*  But until then, Republicans have to make that demand [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=445.88s)]
*  of this administration enforcing the law [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=449.12s)]
*  before there's even a conversation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=451.38s)]
*  about any foreign aid package. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=453.04s)]
*  That's where we need to go. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=455.04s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you for being with us as always. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=456.88s)]
*  We have a new poll tonight. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NimheYoq9Lw&t=459.44s)]
