# Ramaswamy: Consider the three liberal SCOTUS justices' concurrence carefully
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY)
*  Former President Trump, he did call into my radio show to react to today's ruling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=3.84s)]
*  It was a great decision. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=5.12s)]
*  We're very honored by it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=7.08s)]
*  And it basically said you have to win by getting the votes, as opposed to some other way. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=8.32s)]
*  And that's really what we wanted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=13.64s)]
*  And it was a very powerful decision, very well crafted and very well respected, I must [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=17.12s)]
*  say. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=22.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=23.44s)]
*  Here with more on today's Supreme Court ruling, former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=24.44s)]
*  is with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=28.76s)]
*  What's your initial reaction, sir? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=29.8s)]
*  Look, this is a case about national unity. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  And I think the Supreme Court absolutely ruled in the right way, answering the question, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=36.0s)]
*  really, are we one nation or not? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=40.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court held yes, because the heart of the decision was about whether we can have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=42.72s)]
*  a patchwork framework where certain states decide who's on the ballot, other states [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=46.8s)]
*  decide a different person's on the ballot for U.S. president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=51.44s)]
*  That doesn't work if we're one nation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=54.64s)]
*  So that's what this case was really about. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  I thought President Trump did a great job in that press conference and that discussion [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  he held afterwards. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=62.0s)]
*  Speaking about national unity, I think that's the heart of this case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=63.36s)]
*  I was with President Trump earlier today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  And I do think that this is not just about President Trump, but about the future unity [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  of our country itself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=72.4s)]
*  And the Supreme Court, 9-0, came down on the right side of that question. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=74.2s)]
*  And I do think that's a step forward, Sean. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=78.08s)]
*  I don't think this should have ever gone to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=79.68s)]
*  But the fact that it does shows how far we've fallen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=82.04s)]
*  But at the same time, the fact that they came out on the right side of it unanimously [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=84.72s)]
*  is a good step for this country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=88.28s)]
*  What did you make in the concurring opinions of the three liberal justices and also that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=90.8s)]
*  of Amy Coney Barrett, who said the court has settled a politically charged issue in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=95.92s)]
*  volatile season of a presidential election? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=100.6s)]
*  Quote, particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=103.4s)]
*  temperature down, not up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=108.48s)]
*  I think that is a prettyâ€”usually justices will not acknowledge political circumstances [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=111.84s)]
*  surrounding a particular case. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=132.76s)]
*  She did go there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  I think Amy Coney Barrett's actual one-page concurrence was useful. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=138.2s)]
*  Now if you want to go a layer deeper, Sean, and you're asking about this, what do I [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=142.68s)]
*  see in that concurrence? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  What you actually see is they said, okay, the states can't do this, but the federal [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=147.44s)]
*  government could do it, even actors in the federal government outside of Congress. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=150.32s)]
*  So you want to read the subtext of this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=154.92s)]
*  What I think is happening is the court is buying themselves some political latitude [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  to say there's going to be other Trump-related cases that come before the Supreme Court now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=160.88s)]
*  So what you see from the liberal justices is saying that three of them did swing over [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=165.16s)]
*  for a 9-0 unanimous ruling here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=168.84s)]
*  But they say other actors in the federal government, even outside of Congress, could have had that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=171.88s)]
*  authority anyway. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  I think they're buying themselves some leash for going in a different direction in some [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=177.64s)]
*  of those other cases, including the presidential immunity case now making its way up to the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=181.76s)]
*  Supreme Court next month as well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=186.24s)]
*  So that's what I think is actually going on. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And the Roberts Court in particular, more than any court in modern history, Sean, is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=189.76s)]
*  really concerned with perceptions of its institutional legitimacy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=193.6s)]
*  So while I do think today was an outstanding outcome, it was the right outcome for justice [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=197.4s)]
*  and for this country and for national unity 9-0, I think that that descent, it wasn't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=201.32s)]
*  a descent, it was a concurrence by the three liberal justices, plants the seeds for them [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=207.28s)]
*  potentially going a different way in future cases that are coming down the pike. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=211.2s)]
*  How dangerous, Democrats as a part of their strategy, I think they'll talk about January [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  6th and Trump, Trump, Trump is Evil, abortion and the obvious book that they always use, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=222.52s)]
*  the Democratic Party, Republicans are racist and sexist and homophobic and the list goes [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=229.12s)]
*  on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=233.8s)]
*  I've mentioned it many, many times. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=234.8s)]
*  But when you actually look at the heart of this, how would this, what would the result [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=236.36s)]
*  if in fact we have one politician having the power to just unilaterally for whatever reason [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=245.48s)]
*  declare a candidate ineligible to be on a ballot? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=253.32s)]
*  What are the long-term consequences of this? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=257.4s)]
*  The long-term consequences undoing what we set this country into motion in, in 1776. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=262.36s)]
*  That's a monarchy, not a democracy, where one autocrat, one monarch, one individual [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  gets to decide who the people can and cannot elect. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=273.54s)]
*  And 250 years ago, Sean, we are founding fathers who fought a revolution to say that for better [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=276.5s)]
*  or worse, we the people decide who governs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=280.88s)]
*  We the people settle our differences at the ballot box, able to vote for whoever we want, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=284.32s)]
*  where every person has a voice and a vote in that democratic process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=289.3s)]
*  If America means anything, that's what it was founded on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=293.56s)]
*  That is what makes America great. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=296.3s)]
*  That is what makes America itself. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=297.82s)]
*  So what is at stake, you ask? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=299.98s)]
*  I think it is our national identity itself. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=301.38s)]
*  That is who we are. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  That's where the Supreme Court came down on the right side of today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=305.5s)]
*  And I think President Trump gave one of the, I think the great speeches we've seen in a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=308.1s)]
*  long time, solidifying that decision with the right tenor to say that this isn't about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=310.86s)]
*  him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=314.94s)]
*  This is about the future unity of our country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=315.94s)]
*  That's what's at stake. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=318.34s)]
*  And I think that's where the Supreme Court came down today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=319.34s)]
*  Imagine, one elected official can declare somebody guilty of insurrection, a charge [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=321.3s)]
*  that was never even made against President Trump, let alone a conviction. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=326.54s)]
*  Pretty scary scenario, my view. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=331.18s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you as always. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJk38uAeY&t=332.86s)]
