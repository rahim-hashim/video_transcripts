# The 'Biden body bags' are building up every day: Sen. Ted Cruz
**Fox News:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4)
*  Does that not tell the whole story? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=0.0s)]
*  The chaos at the border and its deadly consequences, sadly, were all preventable. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=1.68s)]
*  But as they were with pretty much everything, this administration, once again, is a day [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=7.72s)]
*  late and a dollar short. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=12.96s)]
*  Here with reaction is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Senator, you've been down there more than anybody. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=17.12s)]
*  I think the thing I resent the most is they are just flat out lying. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=19.28s)]
*  Republicans in the House did pass H.R. 1. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=23.96s)]
*  This compromise bill would have allowed 5,000 illegal immigrants still into the country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=27.16s)]
*  It was not a compromise. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=31.96s)]
*  That's not a border security bill. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=33.64s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=35.08s)]
*  Well, listen, I listened to that rhetoric from the campaigns and the crisis we're seeing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=36.08s)]
*  unfolding is what Joe Biden campaigned on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=41.24s)]
*  It's what he believes and what it is, what he intends to continue doing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=44.16s)]
*  Every day, the Biden body bags are building up and more and more people are dying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  More and more children are being brutalized. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=53.2s)]
*  More and more women are being sexually assaulted. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=54.94s)]
*  And I got to say, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, the Democrats in office, they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  do not care. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=63.42s)]
*  This is deliberate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=65.94s)]
*  You know, look, you talk about Lakin Riley, a beautiful 22-year-old nursing student in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=66.94s)]
*  Georgia murdered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=72.74s)]
*  And I'm here to tell you right now that is the direct result of policy and political [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=74.42s)]
*  decisions by Joe Biden and by Democrats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=80.44s)]
*  If you look at the Venezuelan murderer, number one, he came in illegally to this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=83.62s)]
*  The Biden administration apprehended him. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=87.78s)]
*  You know what they should have done? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=89.7s)]
*  They should have put him on a plane and sent him back to Venezuela immediately, but they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=90.98s)]
*  didn't. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden decided to let him go, just to release him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  So they released the murderer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=98.42s)]
*  But then the murderer goes to New York City. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=99.94s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=102.3s)]
*  He's arrested for endangering the safety of a child. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=103.3s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=106.82s)]
*  The Democrats in New York City, they let him go and they don't inform the federal officials. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=108.02s)]
*  They don't want him deported because New York City is proudly a sanctuary city. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=113.34s)]
*  So they let him go again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  And he comes down to Georgia and he murders that young woman. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=119.42s)]
*  You just played Joe Biden there saying, well, we're not going to deport any illegal who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=123.36s)]
*  commits drunk driving. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=127.86s)]
*  Well, let me ask every American who lost a friend or family or loved one to drunk driving. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=128.86s)]
*  Why is it that the Democrats are proudly saying, we want criminals who drive drunk here? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=134.9s)]
*  They're saying it is offensive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=141.22s)]
*  It is harmful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=144.38s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=145.38s)]
*  And it is a cynical politics that puts partisan gain above protecting the lives and the safety [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=147.02s)]
*  of American citizens. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  You know, Senator, you know, you've been down there so often. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  As a matter of fact, when they had kids in cages in the middle of a pandemic and COVID, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=158.74s)]
*  they were overcrowded. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=163.74s)]
*  They wouldn't allow my cameras in there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=164.74s)]
*  You were gracious enough to film it and give us the video so we could show the American [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=167.12s)]
*  people that we have been talking about this for three years. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=172.12s)]
*  We've been showing images for three years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=175.26s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Now all of a sudden the border that they told us for three years was secure and closed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=178.56s)]
*  Now it's the Republicans' fault. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=184.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=186.0s)]
*  Does that, does that, I guess, verbal jiu-jitsu work? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=187.0s)]
*  Because that's incomprehensible to me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=192.0s)]
*  Look, I don't think it's going to work at all. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=195.72s)]
*  Nobody who has an IQ above room temperature is going to believe the Democrats' latest [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  blame that, oh, the border crisis is Republicans' fault. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  Look, remember, when Joe Biden became president, he inherited the lowest rate of illegal immigration [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  in 45 years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=212.26s)]
*  Joe Biden and the Democrats deliberately broke this system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  They caused the highest rate of illegal immigration in history. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=217.16s)]
*  And I'm here to tell you when Donald Trump is re-elected, and I believe he's going to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=220.6s)]
*  be re-elected in November, when he comes back into office in January, we're going to see [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=224.72s)]
*  the numbers plummet again, because what it takes is a president willing to enforce the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=229.6s)]
*  law. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=233.96s)]
*  And you talk about going to the border. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=234.96s)]
*  I was at our southern border yesterday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=235.96s)]
*  I was down on Laredo yesterday. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  I did a town hall down in Laredo. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=240.52s)]
*  I actually did it with the Democratic mayor in Laredo and the Democratic county judge [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=242.8s)]
*  in Laredo. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=247.52s)]
*  And what's interesting is in Texas, Democrats and Republicans can work together reasonably. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=248.52s)]
*  Nobody in South Texas can defend what's happening at our border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=254.52s)]
*  There aren't Democrats who can defend it, because when you see the dead bodies, when [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=258.12s)]
*  you see the women and children brutalized, when you see the people dying of drug overdoses, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=261.8s)]
*  there is no defense. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=266.92s)]
*  And I've got to say, yesterday when I was down on the border, they asked me, do you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=267.92s)]
*  have anything to say to Joe Biden? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=271.92s)]
*  I said, come to the border. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  He announced today he is coming to the border, but I'm here to predict he's going to do what [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=275.12s)]
*  he did in El Paso, which is hide every illegal immigrant and put on a photo op that's fundamentally [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=278.52s)]
*  deceptive. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=283.88s)]
*  Oh, like he shows up in East Palestine a year after the train derailment. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=284.88s)]
*  Day late, dollar short, year late. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=290.76s)]
*  He's three plus years late now, but it's the Republicans' fault. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=292.64s)]
*  It was his policies. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=296.92s)]
*  And then he lied for three years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=298.32s)]
*  Can't make it up, Senator. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=300.04s)]
*  Only in D.C. do you get this kind of lying. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=303.8s)]
*  And we have a big announcement, by the way, as it relates to the border coming up by the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=305.24s)]
*  end of the show. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  As Biden's blunders, they continue to get worse and worse while Democrats, they're now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=312.16s)]
*  scrambling to defend their, well, cognitively deficient presidential candidate. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAjeEdJ3c4&t=322.68s)]
