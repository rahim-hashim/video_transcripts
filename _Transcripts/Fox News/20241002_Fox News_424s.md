# Donald Trump, Jr.: That was a ‘master class’ from JD Vance
**Fox News:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU)
*  All right, joining us now from the Trump Organization, executive vice president Donald Trump Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=0.0s)]
*  By the way, it's freezing in this room. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=4.84s)]
*  It's really cold in here, actually. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=6.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=7.84s)]
*  They're not having heated CBS? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=8.84s)]
*  Especially now that I'm a Florida guy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=9.84s)]
*  It's my first. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=10.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=11.84s)]
*  I think our blood got thinner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=12.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=13.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=14.84s)]
*  I want to tell a true story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=15.84s)]
*  We've known each other since— [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=16.84s)]
*  A long time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=17.84s)]
*  A long time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=18.84s)]
*  I knew you long before your dad ever got into politics. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=19.84s)]
*  He'd always bring me into your office, your brother's office and Ivanka's office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=20.84s)]
*  It was funny because all of a sudden, JD Vance's name comes up again and again, and I didn't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=24.96s)]
*  know him as well as you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=32.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=33.2s)]
*  And I called you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=34.2s)]
*  I said, OK, I know you really want JD Vance. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=35.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=38.84s)]
*  And I said, I don't know him as well as you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=39.84s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=41.36s)]
*  I guess we learned a big lesson tonight because he was spectacular on that stage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=42.68s)]
*  It was a master class. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=47.84s)]
*  I mean, it was just a spectacular performance. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=48.84s)]
*  I mean, he understood the facts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=50.28s)]
*  He steamrolled the moderators when they tried to fact-check him with nonsense, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=52.84s)]
*  He was 100 percent right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=55.84s)]
*  Notice they didn't do that again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=57.56s)]
*  He had just such a command. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=59.4s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=61.28s)]
*  I tweeted during the thing, I'm watching Tim Walz going like this, as JD saw every [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=62.28s)]
*  time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=64.72s)]
*  I mean, the optics of it was terrible. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=65.72s)]
*  I think Tim Walz is voting for Trump Vance. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=66.92s)]
*  It was just an incredible performance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=70.6s)]
*  JD just—he gets it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=72.6s)]
*  Well, it's not going to—because they're not going to have feminine hygiene products [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=73.6s)]
*  in boys' bathrooms or gender-affirming care without parental consent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=76.64s)]
*  No, we're worried about policies that actually matter for Americans, not tampons in boys' [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  bathrooms. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=83.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=84.68s)]
*  You know, and that's the reality, Sean. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=85.68s)]
*  We've seen that today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=86.68s)]
*  We see it not just with the longshoremen's strike, but you see it with literally Iran, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=87.68s)]
*  not through proxies, but actually directly striking Israel itself today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=92.28s)]
*  Notice how that didn't happen under Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  We went from a time of peace to a time of war, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  This is the Kamala Harris Biden administration, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=103.4s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  They've had power. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to pretend as though she magically started her political career three weeks ago [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=108.36s)]
*  when they, you know, shoved her into that role. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  We went from a time of peace to a time of war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  We went from a time of prosperity to a time of poverty. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=118.88s)]
*  Everyone feels it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  The world has been watching, and it has gone to hell in a handbasket, and it's because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  of the policies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Again, we've had four years under Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=128.4s)]
*  You know exactly what my father can do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=131.14s)]
*  Our enemies weren't attacking our allies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=133.42s)]
*  We weren't broke. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  No war in Europe, no inflation, no high interest rates, no war in the Middle East. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=136.52s)]
*  By the way, it feels to me we're on the verge of an all-out war in the Middle East. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=141.08s)]
*  We can have peace again, and we can have prosperity again, but we're not going to have it with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=146.12s)]
*  weak and feckless leaders like Kamala Harris. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=150.46s)]
*  And again, I understand the media is going to media, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=153.12s)]
*  They're going to spin it, she's a moderate, because they'll do anything. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=155.0s)]
*  The marketing department of the left, of course, they're spinning her as though she's a moderate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm looking at her policies over a 25-plus year career, the most radical person in the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=163.28s)]
*  United States Senate, left of Bernie Sanders, and now they're saying, no, she wants the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=168.0s)]
*  wall. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm saying, almost like Joe Biden putting on a MAGA hat, I'm saying, what is going on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  here? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  But they'll tell you whatever you need to hear to get your vote, and then they'll do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  whatever they want. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  Maybe I sound like a broken record, but no fracking, no offshore drilling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  Defund, dismantle, no bail laws. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=186.96s)]
*  Open borders? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=190.84s)]
*  Open borders? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=191.84s)]
*  Free housing, food, healthcare, education, sex change, amnesty, and they have allowed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=192.84s)]
*  in murderers, they have allowed in rapists, they have allowed in other violent criminals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=197.88s)]
*  People were terrorized. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=201.96s)]
*  We have Iranian hit squads looking to assassinate your father after two assassinations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=203.2s)]
*  The other members of my family, including myself. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=207.28s)]
*  OK, and your whole family. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=209.24s)]
*  I got that call, too. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=210.96s)]
*  By the way, I am sorry that you didn't get the call. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=211.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=214.2s)]
*  I did get the call, and I've also, in the last two months, had to explain to my five [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=215.2s)]
*  that someone tried to assassinate their grandfather, who they love a lot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=219.0s)]
*  We've dealt with some stuff, but it's important. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=224.68s)]
*  By the way, your daughter, Kai, who I interviewed at the RSC, she's a special kid. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=226.16s)]
*  She is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=229.2s)]
*  And again, she wasn't apolitical. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=230.2s)]
*  She's a 17-year-old girl. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=231.2s)]
*  But she's been watching the attacks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=233.52s)]
*  She knows the measure of the man. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=235.4s)]
*  She knows my father. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=236.72s)]
*  She plays golf with him every weekend. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=238.04s)]
*  She's probably spent more time with my father than any of the other trumps combined. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=239.36s)]
*  Does she beat him? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=243.12s)]
*  You know, he may be watching, so I've got to be a little careful on this one, but it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=244.12s)]
*  could be close. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  He's a very good golfer, Sean. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=248.83999999999997s)]
*  I've got to be very careful. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  I'll never be seen on television ever again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  But, no, she's great, and they have such a good relationship. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=253.64s)]
*  She was with me when that happened, and she went through it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=257.76s)]
*  That Monday morning, two days later, she calls me like, I want to speak at the RNC. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=260.08s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, that's a big speech for a 17-year-old. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  When I was 17, I probably had a hard time getting up in front of my classroom, and she [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=265.96s)]
*  was just so sick of it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=270.88s)]
*  And you know, honestly, I think the American people are so sick of it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=272.08s)]
*  You know, they're sick of what's going on with immigration. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=275.16s)]
*  They're sick of what's going on with fentanyl. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=278.12s)]
*  They're sick of the wars and the never-ending funding for wars. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=279.92s)]
*  No one's articulated what victory even looks like. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, we can fund that, but we can't take care of people in their own hometowns. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dbEqPFPkU&t=288.12s)]
