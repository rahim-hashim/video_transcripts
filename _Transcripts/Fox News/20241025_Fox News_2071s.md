# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 24, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  As always, thanks for spending some time with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=4.04s)]
*  Twelve days to go. Can you believe it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=6.8s)]
*  Well, the race is still historically very tight, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=8.76s)]
*  but two new and very big polls now show Trump leading nationally. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=11.48s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has him up by two points, 47 to 45. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=16.36s)]
*  And a new CNBC poll also has him up by two. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=19.92s)]
*  Both are within the margin of error. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=23.2s)]
*  But to capitalize on what they believe is a building wave, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump is everywhere, hitting Nevada and Arizona today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=29.84s)]
*  When we win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=34.2s)]
*  and the restoration of our country begins. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=40.28s)]
*  We're going to restore our country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=43.28s)]
*  And there's a new report of infighting among Kamala's staff [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=47.4s)]
*  after numerous underwhelming performances. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=51.0s)]
*  And of course, it gets even worse for her. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=53.92s)]
*  Kamala's CNN town hall was so bad, even the Washington Post panned it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=56.0s)]
*  Tonight, she's in Georgia, dragging out old Bruce Springsteen [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=61.92s)]
*  and Barack Obama to beg for votes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=65.4s)]
*  Which brings me to Kamala's just a riot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=67.76s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=70.48s)]
*  More than 25 million Americans have already voted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=74.64s)]
*  And we knew that if things started to look kind of positive for Trump, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=77.92s)]
*  the Harris hit squad would need an October surprise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  But we didn't think it would be October 1943. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=86.0s)]
*  Well, I guess Democrats fear mongering about abortion [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=90.36s)]
*  wasn't quite getting it done for them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=92.84s)]
*  So they dropped the F-bomb. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, their closing argument is that the man with Jewish grandchildren, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  a Jewish daughter who is a stalwart friend of Israel, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=102.64s)]
*  is a closet fascist who invokes Hitler. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=106.56s)]
*  Who knew Trump was such a talented actor? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=109.72000000000001s)]
*  Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=113.12s)]
*  that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=116.04s)]
*  The Jewish state has never had a better friend in the White House [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  than your president, Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=123.56s)]
*  That I can tell you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  After eight long years in which our alliance was undermined and neglected, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  I am happy to report that the United States-Israeli relationship [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  is stronger now than ever before. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=139.24s)]
*  Now, in fact, Trump was so pro-Israel as president, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Pew Research even found that 42% of American Jews [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  thought he favored Israel too much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=150.52s)]
*  So all of this is ludicrous, and it's so low [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=153.12s)]
*  that it almost doesn't even merit a serious response. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=156.8s)]
*  I was thinking of it this way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  If our generals can't recognize the difference [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=162.4s)]
*  between fascism under Hitler and the American populist movement under Trump, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=165.6s)]
*  well, the angle questions what is being taught in our military academies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=171.04s)]
*  Of course, this smear was carefully choreographed and timed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Step one, the New York Times interview with John Kelly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=179.72s)]
*  Step two, get Kelly to drop the F-bomb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=184.04s)]
*  Step three, Anderson Cooper asked Kamala for her reaction. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=192.92s)]
*  Yes, I do. Yes, I do. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=194.72s)]
*  And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=197.92s)]
*  And step four, the press poodles snap into action [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=204.64s)]
*  as instant validators with somber faces and dire warnings. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=208.16s)]
*  Trump's fascism is the lead story every day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=213.2s)]
*  His cozying up to dictators, his obsession with Hitler that has now come out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=216.8s)]
*  I still see this as General Kelly and those other generals, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=223.4s)]
*  they're still protecting America, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=226.84s)]
*  This isn't about partisanship. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=229.28s)]
*  The language, the actions of political rhetoric is 1930s Germany. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=230.52s)]
*  We've got to wake up. This is not hyperbole. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=237.24s)]
*  This isn't entertainment at value. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=239.6s)]
*  Oh, wait, he just said it's like Germany, Hitler's Germany, but it's not hyperbole. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump shot all of this down moments ago in an interview with our own Bill Mollusion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  She did call me a fascist and everyone knows that's not true. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=254.44s)]
*  They call me everything until, you know, something sticks. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=257.48s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to your former chief of staff, John Kelly, directly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=260.28s)]
*  He said some things about you, essentially accusing you of disparaging American soldiers in an Atlantic article. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  When's the last time you talked to him and how would you like to respond? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=269.84s)]
*  Years ago, I fired him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=272.76s)]
*  He was a bully. He was a bad guy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=276.16s)]
*  And he ended up being a weak guy because all bullies end up being weak. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  And he wasn't a smart guy. It's a bad combination. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=282.24s)]
*  But I fired him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=285.04s)]
*  He made a statement that I'm like Hitler. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=287.12s)]
*  It's just couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=290.56s)]
*  It's just the opposite, actually. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, think about it. The Democrats, they're the party that allowed anti-Semitism on college campuses to fester and to grow. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=296.24s)]
*  And it's the party where, look, Jewish students didn't feel safe walking to their own dorm rooms. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=305.64s)]
*  And the party's claiming that Trump now has a Hitler-esque fascination. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=312.08s)]
*  These people haven't just lost their way. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=316.12s)]
*  They've apparently lost their minds. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  And while it is tempting to just kind of laugh in their faces, given the sheer absurdity and the venality of all this, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  there may be something deeper and more sinister to what they're spewing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=328.12s)]
*  Now, while we know that most people will tune out these hideous smears, some will believe them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=332.48s)]
*  There are whack jobs out there with hero complexes who will listen and believe it is their duty to stop Trump by any means necessary. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=338.88s)]
*  Now, we already had two freaks try to kill Donald Trump in a two-month span. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=349.6s)]
*  Oddly, we still don't know what compelled Thomas Crooks to try to murder Trump and Butler. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=355.32s)]
*  And we still don't really know why Ryan Routh flew across the country to set up his assassination perch in those bushes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=361.92s)]
*  But it is not illogical, in the absence of any countervailing facts, to assume that they believe what they were hearing, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=370.36s)]
*  what they were seeing, and what they were reading about the 45th president. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=379.0s)]
*  And it is not illogical to believe that they decided to take action. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, in the Democrats' desperate desire to hold on to power, they risk setting off a chain of events that could end tragically for this country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=388.72s)]
*  But they simply do not care. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=398.48s)]
*  Now, remember, these are the same people who were still tying Trump to violence on January 6. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=401.44000000000005s)]
*  Back then, remember, they said and they still say his words mattered, challenging the election results. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=407.0s)]
*  He shouldn't have done that. It stoked the unrest. That's their argument. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=411.88000000000005s)]
*  Of course, it was ignoring that Trump told his followers to march peacefully. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=415.48s)]
*  They always ignore that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=418.44s)]
*  But what accusation is worse in politics than the Hitler fascist accusation that they're lobbing now? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=420.28s)]
*  So when Kelly, his assessment was agreed to by Kamala Harris, I thought, why didn't Anderson Cooper follow up with, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=429.08s)]
*  Well, madam, if you truly believe that Trump is a fascist who admires Hitler, will you accept the results of the election if he should win? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  Or Cooper could have asked some criticized Trump for not attending Biden's inauguration in 2021. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=447.23999999999995s)]
*  Will you attend Trump's? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=452.52s)]
*  And, madam, wouldn't it be every patriot's duty to try to stop Donald Trump if he really is a fascist? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  But CNN wouldn't ask any of those very logical questions because they don't really believe any of the things that they're saying. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=463.24s)]
*  None of it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  The truth is they're all out of ideas. They're losing and they're flailing between Obama and Biden. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=472.36s)]
*  They've been in charge, what, a total of 12 years, and they had a chance to fix Washington, to make life better for the working class, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=479.88s)]
*  for minorities, for legal migrants, immigrants, but they didn't do any of that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=488.2s)]
*  And after all, after all their time, all their media, all their celebrity, their Wall Street support, they decide to close out this election with fascism? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=493.12s)]
*  A party confident about its platform, really confident about its nominee, should be able to proudly defend their record. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=506.36s)]
*  But Democrats cannot. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  Rather than answer the concerns of the working people, focus on America's needs, they stayed on their twisted course, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  importing millions of migrants into our communities, spending billions and giveaways to special interests, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  crushing regulations on oil and gas, continuing massive trade deficits, the endless war in Ukraine, and pushing their trans agenda. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=528.92s)]
*  And it has all been a colossal disaster for families, young people and especially working class Americans. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=538.76s)]
*  That's why so many say they're now voting for Trump. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=547.4s)]
*  Trump's a businessman. A lot of people, a lot of black men want to be entrepreneurs. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=552.4s)]
*  They can relate to Trump in the way to they want to make money, they want to have a business. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=556.56s)]
*  And they're and Trump is really supporting business owners and just the everyday American. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=561.08s)]
*  I don't see them all doing that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=566.84s)]
*  No wars. The economy was absolutely incredible. Everybody's making money. He wasn't a dictator then. Why should you be a dictator now? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=568.28s)]
*  I think Trump is going to win. I just can't imagine anyone voting for Kamala. It's the truth. I can't. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=578.72s)]
*  Well, the fact is the smartest people from the old D.C. establishment cannot answer Trump on any of this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=586.72s)]
*  And they're really not interested in convincing anyone either. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=594.04s)]
*  They want you to pipe down, be happy with whatever crumbs they decide to send you and do as you're told. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  But understand this, when they denigrate and defame Trump, their words are really directed at the tens of millions of voters who support him. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=605.2399999999999s)]
*  People just like you. Trump's just the current stand in for the American people. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=613.64s)]
*  And that's the angle. Joining us now, Kamala Harris wanted another debate and she got one, a debate with herself. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  Listen, Kamala Harris participated in a one person debate last night and she lost. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=626.52s)]
*  She was supposed to close the deal at a CNN town hall last night, but somehow she made things worse. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=631.52s)]
*  I'll just tell you what I'm hearing from people who I have been talking to. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=637.96s)]
*  And that is that if her goal was to close the deal, they're not sure she did that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=642.04s)]
*  And, you know, some people have asked, is she being held to a different standard? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  Maybe. But that's maybe the world that she's living in. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=654.68s)]
*  Dana, what different standard is she being held to? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=658.8s)]
*  Is it because she's a woman? Is it because she's black? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=661.92s)]
*  Is it because she's new at this? Because she's not that new at this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=665.68s)]
*  She's been a politician for 20 years. They're still making excuses for her. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=669.3599999999999s)]
*  Do you want a president who the media has to make excuses for? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=675.0s)]
*  We just had that. And that's why Kamala is the nominee. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=679.48s)]
*  If this was the final job interview, Kamala is not getting a callback in any job interview. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=683.32s)]
*  Sounds cliche, but they ask you, what's your biggest weakness? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=690.24s)]
*  What weaknesses do you bring to the table and how do you plan to overcome them while you're in office? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=695.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a great question, Joe. Well, I am certainly not perfect. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=701.0s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think that perhaps a weakness, some would say, but I actually think it's the strength, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=706.76s)]
*  is I really do value having a team of very smart people around me who bring to my decision making process [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=715.16s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=727.0s)]
*  I, my team will tell you, I am constantly saying, let's kick the tire on that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=729.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's kick the tires on it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  My biggest weakness, I could think of a half a dozen things off the top of my head. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=736.68s)]
*  I'm impatient. Sometimes I don't listen carefully. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=740.76s)]
*  Sometimes I'm late. But my biggest weakness is actually my strength. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=744.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=748.4s)]
*  So let me ask you a question right off the bat. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=750.52s)]
*  What do you think your greatest strengths as a manager? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=754.1999999999999s)]
*  Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=756.76s)]
*  I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=759.52s)]
*  Okay. And your strengths? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=767.84s)]
*  Well, my weaknesses are actually strengths. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=770.8s)]
*  Kamel is becoming the stereotype of a typical slippery politician who's just too fuzzy to trust. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=775.08s)]
*  Is there something you can point to in your life, political life or in your life in the last four [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  years that you think is a mistake that you have learned from? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=786.56s)]
*  I mean, I've I've made many mistakes. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  And they range from, you know, if you've ever parented a child, you make lots of mistakes too. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=796.8399999999999s)]
*  In my role as vice president, I mean, I've probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=804.88s)]
*  versed on issues. And I think that is very important. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=814.96s)]
*  It's a mistake not to be well versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=819.24s)]
*  You know, Kamala actually touched on something that makes her human. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  She became a stepmother to Doug's children and she made some mistakes helping raise them. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=827.76s)]
*  That's relatable. A lot of Americans deal with that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=833.36s)]
*  An answer could give us insight into who Kamala is, but she gives us a phony answer that her biggest [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=837.24s)]
*  mistake is that she's too prepared. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=843.32s)]
*  Does anybody believe that Kamala Harris is overprepared for this job? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=845.36s)]
*  Again, off the top of my head, half a dozen things. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=849.7600000000001s)]
*  I was immature in college. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=852.6400000000001s)]
*  I didn't take care of my body in my thirties. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=855.24s)]
*  I shouldn't have swallowed that pill Gutfeld gave me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=859.32s)]
*  She could have killed two birds with one stone and said, well, we probably shouldn't have spent so much money [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=862.6400000000001s)]
*  on covid recovery. We didn't get the number right. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=871.5200000000001s)]
*  You show some humility and then you distance yourself from Biden in the same answer. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=873.12s)]
*  At this point, I'm not sure Kamala can answer. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=879.44s)]
*  What's your favorite color? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=882.08s)]
*  I may not be quick to have the answer as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue sometimes, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  because I'm going to want to research it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=890.0s)]
*  I'm going to want to study it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm kind of a nerd sometimes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=894.76s)]
*  I confess. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=897.44s)]
*  If this is Kamala Harris studied and well researched, we're in trouble. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=900.12s)]
*  She spent 48 hours preparing for this town hall and couldn't even answer this question. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=904.36s)]
*  If you could accomplish only one major policy goal that required congressional action, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  what would it be and why? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=916.84s)]
*  Well, there's not just one. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=920.2s)]
*  I have to be honest with you, Carol. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=921.48s)]
*  There's a lot of work that needs to happen. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=923.44s)]
*  But let's let's I think that maybe part of this point that how I think about it is we've got to get past this era [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=925.24s)]
*  of politics and partisan politics, slowing down what we need to do in terms of progress in our country. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=935.08s)]
*  She couldn't name a single thing she'd do on day one. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=942.24s)]
*  How is this race even close? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=945.04s)]
*  I'm surprised she didn't say, I'll tell you what I won't do on day one, be a dictator. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=947.6s)]
*  Trump said they won drill, baby drill and close the border. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  Kamala said on day one, I'm going to get past the era of partisan politics, slowing down what we need to do in terms of progress in our country. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=958.12s)]
*  That's memorable. Oh, yeah, that is so memorable. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=967.68s)]
*  I'm sure everyone's talking about Kamala's day one agenda. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=971.4799999999999s)]
*  This is when Anderson Cooper started getting annoyed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=975.3599999999999s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=978.92s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=980.84s)]
*  So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=984.52s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  You're agreeing to a bill that would earmark six hundred fifty million dollars to continue building that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=990.1600000000001s)]
*  I I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  Like, let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1009.2s)]
*  Why is there any ideological perspective on it? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1012.76s)]
*  Let's just fix the problem. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1015.44s)]
*  To fix the problem. You're doing this compromise bill. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  It does call for six hundred fifty million dollars that was earmarked under Trump to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1025.88s)]
*  You know, you say you don't think it's stupid anymore. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it was did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  I just talked about that wall. Right. We just talked about it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1037.3999999999999s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1040.08s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1042.4799999999998s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1045.08s)]
*  Kamala is campaigning on fixing the problems she created, promising to build a wall that she tore down and called stupid. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1047.6399999999999s)]
*  But now thinks is a good idea. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1056.32s)]
*  And she's asking the voters to give her the power to do the things that she already has the power to do but hasn't done. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  You've been in the White House for four years. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1066.56s)]
*  You were vice president, not the president. But why wasn't any of that done the last four years? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1068.32s)]
*  Well, there was a lot that was done, but there's more to do, Anderson. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1074.08s)]
*  And I'm pointing out things that need to be done that haven't been done but need to be done. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1077.08s)]
*  They haven't been done because she hasn't done them. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1082.6s)]
*  She's done nothing except reverse the progress Trump made. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1085.48s)]
*  We keep waiting for Kamala to have this big breakout moment that justifies her coronation. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1089.6s)]
*  There has to be some reason the Democrats anointed this woman. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1096.08s)]
*  And it's 12 days until the election. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1099.36s)]
*  And they're all asking her the same exact questions and expecting a better answer. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1102.12s)]
*  How can we differentiate your policy and your beliefs from that of Biden's? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1107.24s)]
*  That's a great question. And thank you. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1111.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, my administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1119.56s)]
*  I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1125.92s)]
*  and believe that we have to actually take new approaches. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  What are the new approaches? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1136.96s)]
*  She's gotten asked the same series of questions for the last month. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1138.96s)]
*  How are you different than Joe? What happened to the border? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  How are you going to tackle inflation? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1146.0s)]
*  Did you notice Biden was slowing down at any time? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1148.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, and who are you? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1151.92s)]
*  And what are you gonna do on day one? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1154.04s)]
*  She's hurting herself on CNN and shows, like, The View. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1157.08s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1161.8s)]
*  The media's given up. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1163.68s)]
*  And now they're embarrassed that they propped her up. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1165.2s)]
*  When she doesn't want to answer a question, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1168.84s)]
*  her habit is to kind of go to word-salad city. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1171.6s)]
*  The word-salad stuff gets on my nerves. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1175.76s)]
*  I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1178.0s)]
*  She focused a lot more on Donald Trump, I think it's fair to say, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1180.2s)]
*  than she did on many specifics in terms of what she would do as president. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1185.5600000000002s)]
*  She's like a true double threat. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1191.48s)]
*  You know, she's terrible on her feet when she gets unexpected questions. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1193.0400000000002s)]
*  And simultaneously, she can't even answer the expected questions. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1196.0s)]
*  It's nothing, nothing, nothing. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1200.16s)]
*  Empty, empty, empty. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1201.8400000000001s)]
*  If she were an animal, she'd be a duck-billed platitude. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1203.2s)]
*  Kamala went from the next Messiah to a duck-billed platitude. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1205.68s)]
*  And you have to remember, these CNN people, they're there to help. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1209.76s)]
*  This is a hand-picked town hall with her good friend Anderson, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1214.36s)]
*  who isn't asking gotcha questions. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, what's your biggest weakness? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  What's your biggest mistake? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1222.32s)]
*  These are questions an admissions director asks a 13-year-old [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1224.56s)]
*  applying to prep school. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1228.56s)]
*  Leland, tell me about a challenge you've faced in your life [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1230.6s)]
*  that you were able to overcome. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1234.2s)]
*  Could you see Anderson Cooper asking Trump the questions he's asking Kamala? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1237.72s)]
*  She is being held to a different standard, and she's not even up to it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1242.2s)]
*  I think that she takes a really long time to get to her point [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1246.96s)]
*  and that she does rely on talking points too often. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1254.56s)]
*  I think she's gotten much better than she used to, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1258.44s)]
*  but it's almost as if she's afraid to say something [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  that will later come back to haunt her. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1265.72s)]
*  I just wish she would say, this is our plan, or you're right, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1268.04s)]
*  a lot of immigrants have, illegal immigrants have come into this country [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1273.0800000000002s)]
*  during the Biden administration, but this is why, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1276.8400000000001s)]
*  and this is what I want to do about it moving forward. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1279.68s)]
*  You know, I just, I don't find her explanation of policy that compelling [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1283.0800000000002s)]
*  compared to, say, someone like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1291.0s)]
*  Kamala's not Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1294.56s)]
*  Tell me something I don't know, Katie. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1297.08s)]
*  The media made Kamala from scratch this summer [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1299.4s)]
*  and told everyone she was sensational, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1302.16s)]
*  and are now disappointed she's collapsing during the home stretch. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1305.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris was just a fantasy of the media's imagination, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1309.24s)]
*  an anything-but-Joe doll that they pieced together in Chicago, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1312.96s)]
*  and now they're all shocked she could barely walk. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1317.4s)]
*  The scary thing is, if the election had been in September, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1320.44s)]
*  Kamala might have won, and America would have been stuck [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1324.2s)]
*  with a woman not even cut out to be a small-town mayor. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1327.4s)]
*  That's how corrupt the Kamala candidacy is. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1330.92s)]
*  It was a ruse that ran out of runway. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight, Democrats, they have failed. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  Americans, all of you across the country, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1341.0800000000002s)]
*  their policies have caused backbreaking inflation, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1343.44s)]
*  rising crime, a housing crisis, and, of course, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  an illegal immigration crisis. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1349.48s)]
*  It has created one of the biggest national security threats [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1352.16s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1355.24s)]
*  We now have known terrorists inside our country. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1356.92s)]
*  Iranian hit squads, we know, are in the country. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1359.64s)]
*  We have gang members, people that have murdered Americans, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1362.96s)]
*  raped Americans, violent crimes committed against Americans. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  We have cartels, and the list can go on and on. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1369.4s)]
*  And now, even simple tasks have become worse [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1372.8000000000002s)]
*  under the radical policies of Harris and Biden. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  You can't even buy laundry detergent [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1378.48s)]
*  without having to call over a cashier in some stores [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  to unlock some glass security case. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  That is, if you can actually afford it, and gassing up, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  yeah, buck, buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1390.6799999999998s)]
*  How does that feel every time you fill up your car? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1392.56s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1394.84s)]
*  Now, no matter how hard you work, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1396.04s)]
*  the American dream is now getting out of reach [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  for so many people, two-thirds of Americans saying [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  they're gulping water, Washington Post even suggesting [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1402.9599999999998s)]
*  that Americans now need to give up on the American dream [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1406.6s)]
*  and move out of a house or the backyard, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1409.84s)]
*  settle for a townhouse. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1411.84s)]
*  Really, we should settle? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1414.3999999999999s)]
*  No, how about we aspire to? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1416.12s)]
*  And the media mob and the left-wing, you know, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1418.32s)]
*  in this country scratching their heads. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1421.24s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump doing so well? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not sexism as suggested by Barack Obama, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1426.04s)]
*  or racism and sexism suggested by, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1430.2s)]
*  of African-American men as alleged by Stacey Abrams. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1433.9199999999998s)]
*  Pretty insulting comments. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1437.72s)]
*  These surrogates for Kamala, they're not doing too well. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1439.16s)]
*  They're not helping her. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1442.28s)]
*  Coming up tonight, we'll check in with my buddy, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1443.88s)]
*  our friend, Stephen A. Smith. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1445.48s)]
*  He will join us with more on why Kamala Harris [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  is actually losing so much support from African-American men [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1450.1200000000001s)]
*  and Hispanic-American men, but let's be clear about this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1453.72s)]
*  The serious problems that are facing most Americans, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1457.28s)]
*  they're not going to get better [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1460.8000000000002s)]
*  under a Harris administration. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1462.8400000000001s)]
*  She even said, I changed nothing. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1465.0s)]
*  At best, that would be the best case scenario. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1467.08s)]
*  She'd be a continuation of Joe Biden, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1469.76s)]
*  which in and of itself is a continuation of American decline. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  At worst, she will embrace her stated positions, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1477.32s)]
*  her own words, those core radical extremes, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1481.2s)]
*  socialist Marxist values, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1484.72s)]
*  and kind of turn America into Venezuela. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1486.8s)]
*  Now, during a disastrous town hall last night, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1489.52s)]
*  Kamala failed to take any responsibility [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1492.12s)]
*  for the failures of the Harris-Biden administration [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1494.84s)]
*  and could not or would not say [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1497.44s)]
*  how the next four years would be any different. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1499.8s)]
*  It was a disaster last night. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1504.72s)]
*  Some voters, though, might ask, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1505.8s)]
*  you've been in the White House for four years. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1507.08s)]
*  You were vice president, not the president, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  but why wasn't any of that done for the last four years? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, there was a lot that was done, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1514.68s)]
*  but there's more to do, Anderson, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1516.0s)]
*  and I'm pointing out things that need to be done [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1517.6399999999999s)]
*  that haven't been done but need to be done, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1520.6s)]
*  and I'm not gonna shy away from saying, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1522.96s)]
*  hey, these are still problems that we need to fix. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1524.96s)]
*  Haven't been done, need to be done. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1530.4s)]
*  We have to do them. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1532.3600000000001s)]
*  I can't take it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1533.88s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1534.72s)]
*  Apparently, your border czar, Kamala Harris, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1535.68s)]
*  was just not prepared for a question [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1538.16s)]
*  about illegal immigration or her hypocrisy [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1540.18s)]
*  on the border wall. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  She once called that Donald Trump Medieval Vanity Project. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1544.8400000000001s)]
*  How was it even possible? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1549.04s)]
*  She didn't have an answer for this. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1552.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1554.0s)]
*  Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1555.32s)]
*  more than 50 times. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1557.52s)]
*  You called it stupid, useless, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1558.6s)]
*  and a medieval vanity project. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1560.52s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1565.12s)]
*  So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1568.8s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1573.0s)]
*  But you're agreeing to a bill [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1574.6s)]
*  that would earmark $650 million [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1575.7199999999998s)]
*  to continue building that wall. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1577.9199999999998s)]
*  I pledge that I am gonna bring forward [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1580.04s)]
*  that bipartisan bill to further strengthen [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1582.44s)]
*  and secure our border. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1586.52s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1587.72s)]
*  To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  It does call for $650 million [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1591.52s)]
*  that was earmarked under Trump [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1593.84s)]
*  to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1595.3s)]
*  I am not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  So you don't think it's stupid anymore? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1599.24s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1601.34s)]
*  did not make much sense [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1603.96s)]
*  because he actually didn't do much of anything. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1605.08s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1608.32s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1610.2s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1611.04s)]
*  But you do wanna build some wall. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1613.3999999999999s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1615.98s)]
*  Oh my gosh, just to get a simple answer. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1619.72s)]
*  Tonight, Kamala Harris is getting mocked [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1622.1599999999999s)]
*  and ridiculed for that performance, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1624.1599999999999s)]
*  especially when she declared her only weakness [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1625.76s)]
*  was that she cares too much and she works too hard [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1628.3799999999999s)]
*  and surrounds herself with good people and everything. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1634.34s)]
*  What weaknesses do you bring to the table [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1635.76s)]
*  and how do you plan to overcome them while you're in office? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1637.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a great question, Joe. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1641.48s)]
*  Well, I am certainly not perfect. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1643.48s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1645.52s)]
*  And I think that, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1647.28s)]
*  perhaps a weakness, some would say, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1652.56s)]
*  but I actually think it's the strength [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1654.24s)]
*  is I really do value having a team [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1655.7s)]
*  of very smart people around me [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1659.58s)]
*  who bring to my decision-making process [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1661.76s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1667.56s)]
*  And that is why I engage and bring folks around. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  So I may not be quick to have the answer [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1672.8s)]
*  as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1675.24s)]
*  sometimes because I'm gonna wanna research it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1678.52s)]
*  I'm gonna wanna study it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1681.56s)]
*  I'm kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1683.84s)]
*  And some might call that a weakness. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1688.2s)]
*  The giggling, the non-answer, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1693.22s)]
*  you know, the passage of time is about time passing. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1696.24s)]
*  Our communities are about people in the community [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1699.44s)]
*  that like the community [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1702.4s)]
*  because they live together in the community as a community. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1703.56s)]
*  Democrats cannot be happy tonight. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  One political analyst of fake news CNN said, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1709.8s)]
*  Kamala participated in a one-person debate and she lost. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1712.88s)]
*  David Axelrod called her performance, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1717.04s)]
*  I wish I'd thought of it, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1719.9s)]
*  a word salad city and frustration and despair [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1721.2s)]
*  and fake news CNN was palpable. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1726.36s)]
*  You know if you lost CNN, you lost. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1728.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1733.12s)]
*  The things that would concern me is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1734.52s)]
*  when she doesn't wanna answer a question, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1736.0s)]
*  her habit is to kind of go to word salad city. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1738.82s)]
*  And she did that on a couple of answers. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1742.96s)]
*  One was on Israel. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1744.72s)]
*  Anderson asked a direct question, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1745.8799999999999s)]
*  would you be stronger on Israel than Trump? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1747.24s)]
*  And there was a seven-minute answer, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1750.04s)]
*  but none of it related to the question he was asking. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1753.08s)]
*  If her goal was to close the deal, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1756.32s)]
*  they're not sure she did that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1760.48s)]
*  I think that the word salad stuff gets on my nerves. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1761.68s)]
*  I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1764.48s)]
*  She focused a lot more on Donald Trump. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1766.64s)]
*  I think it's fair to say than she did on many specifics [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1770.88s)]
*  in terms of what she would do. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1775.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris participated in a one-person debate [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1776.72s)]
*  last night and she lost. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1779.04s)]
*  The word salad, the giggling, the non-answers, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1782.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is Hitler and he's a fascist. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1784.84s)]
*  I mean, it's just unbelievable we're at this point. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, he couldn't believe [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1793.56s)]
*  how bad Kamala's answers were. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1795.08s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1796.6s)]
*  She said during that town hall, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1797.92s)]
*  she believes they've handled the border correctly. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1799.44s)]
*  CNN pressed her on it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1801.76s)]
*  Would you have done anything different? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1803.08s)]
*  Do you regret anything? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1804.28s)]
*  And she said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1805.3999999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute, that she's handled it correctly? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1807.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1809.6s)]
*  She said that? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1811.92s)]
*  She said that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1812.76s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1813.6s)]
*  We allowed 21 million people in. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1815.08s)]
*  We allowed 13,099 murderers. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1816.96s)]
*  We allowed mental institutions from all over the world. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1820.12s)]
*  If she said that, look, she's a grossly incompetent person. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  And if she said that, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1827.8799999999999s)]
*  they had the worst border in history. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1829.6s)]
*  Now, as you can probably tell, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1832.52s)]
*  almost no one on either side of the aisle, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1833.56s)]
*  you know, this thing says Kamala Harris is a good candidate. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  Make no mistake here. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1841.12s)]
*  She would be an even worse president. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1842.56s)]
*  That's the scary part. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1844.24s)]
*  And her closing argument to you, the American people, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1845.28s)]
*  is that Donald Trump is a fascist and a Nazi, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  and that her surrogates are claiming [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1851.24s)]
*  that she's Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1853.52s)]
*  We have all heard these smears times and times again. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1856.36s)]
*  By the way, by Democrats historically, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  over the last eight years, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  they even compared John McCain, Mitt Romney, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1865.8s)]
*  Paul Ryan to Hitler. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1870.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, Trump's presidency was marked by, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1871.88s)]
*  let's see, global peace, economic growth and stability, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1874.0400000000002s)]
*  by some measures, the best we'd had in 60 years, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1878.72s)]
*  wealth income going up, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  lowest job for minorities in this country [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1883.76s)]
*  that had suffered under the Obama years and the Biden years. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1886.48s)]
*  And Israel never had a better friend in the White House [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1890.8000000000002s)]
*  than Donald J. Trump. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1893.76s)]
*  And needless to say, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1895.24s)]
*  Americans, they're just not buying Kamala's smear campaign. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1897.0s)]
*  As of tonight, Donald Trump is up [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1900.92s)]
*  in four separate national polls, national. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1902.48s)]
*  He's up by three in the Wall Street Journal, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1904.76s)]
*  and up by two according to NBC. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1907.32s)]
*  He's up by two and over 50% according to Forbes. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1909.6s)]
*  Rasmussen has him up by three. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1914.88s)]
*  Now these polls looked a lot different four years ago, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1917.24s)]
*  even though Trump lost by razor thin margin, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1920.12s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal had him down [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1923.56s)]
*  by a whopping 10 points in 2020. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1925.72s)]
*  CNBC showed him down 10. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1928.08s)]
*  Rasmussen had Trump down by one. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1930.32s)]
*  And at this point in 2020, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  zero national polls showed Donald Trump in the lead. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1935.2s)]
*  In fact, the Real Clear Politics average [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1938.64s)]
*  showed Biden up by more than eight points [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1940.52s)]
*  at this point in 2020. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1942.96s)]
*  And now Harris is up by less than eight point [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1945.32s)]
*  and trending in the wrong direction. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1948.2s)]
*  And in the battleground states, Real Clear Politics, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1950.44s)]
*  you see a similar pattern. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1952.92s)]
*  At this point in 2020, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1954.48s)]
*  Trump was down by nearly a point in Georgia, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1955.92s)]
*  more than five in Wisconsin, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1958.2s)]
*  more than five in Pennsylvania, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1959.68s)]
*  more than nine in Michigan, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1961.48s)]
*  more than two points in Arizona, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1962.88s)]
*  more than five points in Nevada, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1964.88s)]
*  and more than a point in North Carolina. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1966.88s)]
*  Now every one of those states has flipped [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1969.5600000000002s)]
*  and Donald Trump is leading the Real Clear Politics average [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1971.88s)]
*  in the battleground states. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1975.44s)]
*  His favorability rating is also up four points. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1976.5600000000002s)]
*  While Kamala's favorability is more than seven points lower [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1979.92s)]
*  than Biden at this point in 2020. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  But again, there's only one poll, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1986.2s)]
*  and I say this with all seriousness, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1988.44s)]
*  only one poll that matters, and that's election day. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1991.3200000000002s)]
*  And despite a dramatic shift in the polls [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1995.5200000000002s)]
*  and the betting markets, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1997.8000000000002s)]
*  this race is still within the margin of error. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  I am asking everybody, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2002.0400000000002s)]
*  if you care about the future of your country, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2003.68s)]
*  you wanna leave it in a better position [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2005.6000000000001s)]
*  for your children and grandchildren, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2007.4s)]
*  assume that your vote will decide the outcome of this race. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2009.24s)]
*  Don't forget that red wave in 2022, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2014.08s)]
*  everybody was predicting it never materialized, did it? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2017.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are desperate, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2021.36s)]
*  they are terrified of losing power, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2023.32s)]
*  they hate Donald Trump, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2025.36s)]
*  they will jump through hoops to turn out their base. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2026.56s)]
*  The only way to counter this [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2029.72s)]
*  is to treat every single day like election day. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2031.28s)]
*  In states all across the country, it's election day. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2035.0s)]
*  You can vote tomorrow morning, and don't wait. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2038.64s)]
*  The polls, get out, vote, bank your vote. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2042.5200000000002s)]
*  I talked to my friend Joe Bustardi, weatherbell.com. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2046.0400000000002s)]
*  He said, Sean, we may have as many [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2049.08s)]
*  as two more hurricanes this year. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2050.6800000000003s)]
*  What if it happens election week? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2052.04s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2053.4s)]
*  This is not the system I want, system we got. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2054.6400000000003s)]
*  You wanna change it, you gotta win elections. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2057.08s)]
