# Sean Hannity: Biden is in rough shape
**Fox News:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight there is frankly no other way to put it but America is in rough [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=0.0s)]
*  shape and Joe Biden your president he's pretty much the one person you can blame. Now our [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=12.24s)]
*  soldiers they are under attack, Biden does little to respond, cargo ships are targeted [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  by terrorists while Joe just looks the other way. The southern border has been an unmitigated [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=23.16s)]
*  disaster for three plus years and Biden he just pretends that all is fine. The economy is in an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=28.56s)]
*  inflationary nightmare but the president says it's never been better but these are just a few of the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=35.92s)]
*  very serious problems that the president now has to face ahead of 2024 and Biden will also need to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=42.64s)]
*  contend with a looming impeachment proceeding that has been credibly accused of public corruption, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=49.76s)]
*  he has been and the evidence of wrongdoing that is substantial although the media as usual just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=56.56s)]
*  wants to cover for all things Biden. Now the bottom line is vice president Joe Biden took [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=62.72s)]
*  official actions that benefited his son and his son's foreign business partners at the very same [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=67.84s)]
*  time the Biden family has been making millions from these very same foreign partners some of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  our top geopolitical foes and according to Hunter a lot of that money went to the big guy himself. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=79.68s)]
*  Hunter meanwhile is an accused tax cheat is now facing felony charges with speculation that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=85.36s)]
*  fairer violations implicating his father could soon be on the way. Now naturally after years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=91.68s)]
*  of non-stop bogus witch hunts against Trump well many Democrats now they have suddenly lost their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=97.92s)]
*  appetite for impeachment. Russia collusion truther Jamie Raskin is now reportedly working behind the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=104.56s)]
*  scenes on Capitol Hill begging Republican lawmakers not to move forward with proceedings. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=111.2s)]
*  Now put simply Democrats they are in a state of panic the vast majority of you the American [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=117.28s)]
*  people nearly 70 percent believe that your president Joe Biden illegally and unethically [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=122.48s)]
*  was involved in his son's business deals. Now that number is only going to get worse with the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=128.8s)]
*  bright lights of an impeachment proceeding. Now sadly Joe doesn't really seem to have the ability [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=134.4s)]
*  to defend himself and as Trump said it's not even clear that Biden even knows he's alive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=139.6s)]
*  So today he looked totally completely utterly confused confounded unsure of his surroundings [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  yet again at an event in Philly during his brief remarks Biden failed to address the most or most [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=152.32s)]
*  pressing issues of our time and instead fill time with one of his very favorite tall tales about his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=160.0s)]
*  wife a house fire and his beloved Corvette you know the one that was next to all the top secret [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=167.2s)]
*  classified documents but they didn't rate his house take a look. It also saved my home and my [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=173.44s)]
*  wife's life when I was away it was the last day that the most famous guy doing meat to press [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=179.92s)]

*  and the smoke literally ended up being that thick literally that thick you've seen it you guys have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=203.68s)]
*  seen it I wasn't there and my wife was there and my my dog and my cat and my 67 Corvette [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=209.12s)]
*  but all kidding aside they saved my wife got her out saved my home. Now according to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=218.72s)]
*  authorities the fire was tiny it was very small it was contained to the kitchen it was put out [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=225.76s)]
*  almost immediately without any injuries minimal damage to the house but that has not stopped Joe [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvY7Wqcxrwc&t=231.67999999999998s)]
