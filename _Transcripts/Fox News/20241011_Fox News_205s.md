# Ohio senate candidate details opponent’s ‘radical’ positions
**Fox News:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs)
*  We're going to get back to the rally in just a second, but one race that is tightened [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=0.0s)]
*  for the U.S. Senate significantly is Bernie Moreno of Ohio against Sherrod Brown. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=4.2s)]
*  If we can bring up Bernie and get his reaction to what's going on in Reno and the state [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=10.08s)]
*  of the race. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=14.92s)]
*  And let's look at Sherrod Brown's record. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=17.12s)]
*  He's almost 100 percent Harris, Biden. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=18.92s)]
*  What did he say about the borders? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=22.76s)]
*  What did he say about Donald Trump? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=25.28s)]
*  Wasn't very complimentary. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=27.76s)]
*  Doesn't seem in touch with the people of Ohio. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=29.2s)]
*  No, he called President Trump racist. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=31.28s)]
*  He said the wall was stupid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=34.6s)]
*  He said the border was a right-wing conspiracy theory. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=36.0s)]
*  Voted twice to impeach him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=39.2s)]
*  Called President Trump a threat to democracy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=40.92s)]
*  Voted with Biden 100 percent of the time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  And when Trump was in office, stabbed him at the back at every single turn. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=45.6s)]
*  Sean? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=49.32s)]
*  You know, one of the interesting phenomenons is, like, Harris wants to hide her radicalism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=50.32s)]
*  Same with Tim Walz. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=56.56s)]
*  That's why they're doing only friendly interviews. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=57.56s)]
*  They've never been asked any tough questions. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=60.56s)]
*  But I talked to my buddy Bill Cunningham on the big one, LW, in Cincinnati, and he tells [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=63.6s)]
*  me all the time that if you look at commercials, you would think Sherrod Brown is a mega-conservative, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=72.4s)]
*  and he's not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=77.28s)]
*  No, listen, they can't actually run on their record, Sean, because they would lose 70-30. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=78.28s)]
*  The reality is what they try to do is pretend there's something different at home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  But look, if your viewers go on berniemarino.com, they can help me beat him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=89.12s)]
*  This guy's got all kinds of money coming into Ohio to run those lies, to put those commercials [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=93.36s)]
*  on there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=98.52s)]
*  We need your help at berniemarino.com to fight back, Sean, because we're going to expose [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=99.52s)]
*  him for the radical leftist that he is, and we're going to win this race. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=103.78s)]
*  We're going to fire Chuck Schumer, and we're going to make certain that President Trump's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=108.16s)]
*  agenda gets passed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Tell us his most radical positions. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, he's for flying these people from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti into America. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Four thousand private jets that have brought illegals into this country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=123.88s)]
*  FEMA's resettled them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=128.28s)]
*  They're on welfare, social security, food stamps. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=129.68s)]
*  This is outrageous that you'd even bring one person on a private jet from a foreign country [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=132.44s)]
*  to put independent on our social safety net, let alone over half a million, Sean. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=143.56s)]
*  Well, this race is now tightened. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=144.56s)]
*  It's a one-point race. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  And I've got to imagine with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket and this being Ohio, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=148.44s)]
*  a pretty red state, that this is a winnable seat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  What are your closing arguments for the people in Ohio? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=157.68s)]
*  My closing argument is simple. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  You need outsiders. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=164.64s)]
*  You need business people to go to Washington, D.C. to fix it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=165.64s)]
*  This guy's been around for 50 years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=169.2s)]
*  We've lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=171.72s)]
*  It's time for him to go. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't reflect Ohio values. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=176.4s)]
*  Again, if your viewers can go on berniemorino.com. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=178.16s)]
*  We'll have the resources to expose him, and we'll win this race, Sean, and we'll deliver [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=180.6s)]
*  a Republican majority in the United States Senate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=185.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=187.68s)]
*  Bernie Moreno is Senate candidate from the great state of Ohio, the Buckeye State. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=188.72s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=192.62s)]
*  John Hannity here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGeldQ_eGs&t=193.62s)]
