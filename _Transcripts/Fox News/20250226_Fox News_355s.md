# 'The left has lost its mind,' Tom Homan declares
**Fox News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA)
*  We are coming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=0.0s)]
*  And he joins us right now with reaction to all of this. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=1.0s)]
*  The doxing thing upsets me the most, because between tipping off various groups about ICE [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=4.2s)]
*  raids in advance, it takes away the element of surprise. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=12.4s)]
*  That puts agents' lives in jeopardy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=15.52s)]
*  Now they're doxing them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=18.2s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=19.92s)]
*  Go to this guy's house and kill this guy? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=20.92s)]
*  Sounds like a threat to me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=22.36s)]
*  And what is the—what will the reaction be? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=24.64s)]
*  Well, it's under investigation right now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=27.04s)]
*  Matter of fact, I have a meeting tomorrow morning with the Department of Justice. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=31.16s)]
*  I think that's crossing the line of impediment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  And I hope the Department of Justice agrees with me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=35.8s)]
*  Should we find out who's doing it? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Hopefully we can prosecute them and put them in jail. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=39.6s)]
*  Look, I know about doxing, Sean. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I got a state—Governor Youngkin has assigned a state trooper to my home 24-7. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=43.2s)]
*  I have a marked car outside my door right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=48.2s)]
*  I got a security detail. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=50.68s)]
*  The left has lost her mind. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=51.96s)]
*  The right has lost her mind. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=55.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=56.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=57.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=60.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=61.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=63.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=64.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=66.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=67.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=68.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=69.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=70.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=71.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let them do it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=72.0s)]
* ail [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=73.0s)]
*  rights of illegals over the safety of citizens in their towns? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=103.0s)]
*  Look, the people who vote, these people, they need to take into consideration what these [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=106.24s)]
*  people are doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=112.3s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=113.3s)]
*  We are prioritizing public safety threats—child predators, rapists, murderers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=114.54s)]
*  These are the worst of the worst walking around your communities. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=120.68s)]
*  And you would think any elected mayor, any elected governor, any elected city councilwoman [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=123.8s)]
*  would want public safety threats removed from their communities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=128.72s)]
*  They're no more responsibility of the taxpayers, the voters. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=131.88s)]
*  They expect a safe community. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  So I hope people are waking up to these far-left nuts who want to push back against ICE and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=136.76s)]
*  what we're doing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=141.52s)]
*  We're making communities safer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=142.52s)]
*  We're keeping President Trump's promise to make communities safer and end illegal [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=143.76s)]
*  alien crime in this country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=148.36s)]
*  You know, for the longest time during the campaign on this show, we would roll the names [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=150.8s)]
*  of people that were murdered and a lot of names that people have not heard, people that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=154.52s)]
*  were raped, other victims of violent crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=158.34s)]
*  That list gets longer and longer and longer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=161.38s)]
*  And then I listen to, you know, idiots like Michael Moore, oh, we're deporting maybe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=164.06s)]
*  the person that will cure cancer in the future. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=168.32s)]
*  OK, they can cure cancer in their country, and we'll pay them a lot of money for whatever [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=170.78s)]
*  they discover. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=175.08s)]
*  To me, you know, what part of murder, rape, violent crime, drug dealing are they not understanding? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=176.86s)]
*  Known terrorists in this country, what part of that being dangerous to every American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=183.3s)]
*  are they not comprehending? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=187.58s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=191.98s)]
*  You want to talk about young adults, young children. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=192.98s)]
*  You know, most of the young adults that came across that border during the Biden administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  were between the ages 15 and 17. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=200.46s)]
*  Many of them are gang members. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=203.22s)]
*  We did an operation in New York City and arrested almost 500 gang members, Operation Matador. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  Forty-eight percent of them came across the border claiming to be a child. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=210.86s)]
*  So you don't know what you have. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=215.56s)]
*  A lot of these so-called children are actually, you know, dangerous gang members. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=216.56s)]
*  And I wish Michael Moore would go talk to an ancient mom and dad. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=221.3s)]
*  Talk to a few of the ancient moms and dads I've talked to over my career. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=224.46s)]
*  I've talked to hundreds of them, like American citizen parents who buried their children [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=227.58s)]
*  because their children was murdered and raped by an illegal alien. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=232.54s)]
*  Talk to the parents of a young lady that was burned alive on a subway in New York City. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=236.38s)]
*  Governor Hoco comes out and says she agrees criminal illegal aliens should be removed, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=240.7s)]
*  but yet she wants to fire Mayor Adams for speaking with me about getting back into Rikers [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=245.74s)]
*  Island to arrest the bad guys who commit crimes in New York City. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  She wants a green light law where CBP and ICE officers can't even run a license plate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=254.26s)]
*  number for a New York State license plate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=259.08s)]
*  They don't know who they're pulling over. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=261.26s)]
*  That's a dangerous situation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  There's another nut that should be removed from office. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=264.78s)]
*  It's disgusting, but they're not going to slow us down, Sean. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=267.46s)]
*  We're coming. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=270.78s)]
*  We're coming across this country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=271.78s)]
*  We're going to arrest criminal aliens. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=272.78s)]
*  You're not going to stop us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=274.58s)]
*  I've never met anybody in my life. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  I've known you a long time that when they get their focus and they're dialed in on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=278.86s)]
*  a mission, they're committed to finishing it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=283.82s)]
*  Last question. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=286.98s)]
*  Are you making progress? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=288.38s)]
*  I was asking DHS Secretary Noem about this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=289.38s)]
*  Are you making progress finding the people that are endangering ICE agents' lives by [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=293.56s)]
*  tipping off people of pending raids by ICE? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=298.5s)]
*  Are you making progress finding those people? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=302.98s)]
*  Yes, made progress. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  We know who leaked the Aurora, Colorado operation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  That is under investigation as we speak. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=313.26s)]
*  And we're going to keep looking for any other leaks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=316.26s)]
*  I just came back from Colony Ridge, Texas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=317.7s)]
*  Great operation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  Rest over 100 people, most of them criminals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  Operation went great. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=324.14s)]
*  No leaks. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=325.14s)]
*  Operation security was the finest, so it was a great operation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=326.14s)]
*  Yeah, well, I will say this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=328.7s)]
*  I've known Pam Bondi, the attorney general, a long time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=330.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure when she finds out ICE agents are being doxed, that's going to be a major [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=333.26s)]
*  legal issue in the lives of the people that are doing that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=338.82s)]
*  We appreciate the good work, appreciate your time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=342.18s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYirriIxIA&t=344.34000000000003s)]
