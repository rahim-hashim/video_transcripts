# Sen. Kennedy: Democrats have to try harder not to ‘suck’
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8)
*  Here with the best reaction we could ever want, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=0.0s)]
*  You know what this makes me want to do? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=4.32s)]
*  I have friends that own Teslas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And if they're going to have a boycott and try to harm Elon Musk for exposing waste, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=7.68s)]
*  fraud, abuse and corruption, you know what? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=12.36s)]
*  I think my next car, I think I'm going to really look into a Tesla. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=14.44s)]
*  I think that's going to be my next car. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=17.88s)]
*  Well, with respect to Ms. Crowe, I'd make a couple of points, Sean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Number one, Ms. Crowe is entitled to her opinion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=27.6s)]
*  Number two, I think she means well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  But if she ever had a clever thought, it died alone and afraid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=36.44s)]
*  I think point three, I think that it should not go unnoticed that President Biden got [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=44.56s)]
*  a lot of his advice from pop singers and movie stars and people who partied with Harvey Weinstein. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=52.28s)]
*  And we know how that turned out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=62.72s)]
*  In terms of the Democrats, I've got a lot of friends who are Democrats, and they haven't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=66.6s)]
*  asked me for advice. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=72.84s)]
*  But if I did, I'd tell them, look, you just got to try harder not to suck. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=73.84s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=79.16s)]
*  Over the past four years, the Democrats mismanaged Congress, they mismanaged COVID, they mismanaged [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=81.4s)]
*  the economy, they mismanaged inflation, they mismanaged the national debt, they mismanaged [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=89.24s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=94.64s)]
*  More recently, in their opposition to President Trump and Mr. Musk, the Democrats have chosen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=96.4s)]
*  to support the bureaucrats and the spending porn over the American taxpayer, just like [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=103.48s)]
*  they support illegal immigration over the rule of law, just like they support transgender [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=111.12s)]
*  athletes over women's sports, just like they support Hamas terrorists over Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=118.68s)]
*  All Democrats are not like this, but the party is controlled right now by people who majored [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=127.44s)]
*  in online activism with a minor and puberty blockers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=136.16s)]
*  I know these people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=141.0s)]
*  They think men can breastfeed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=142.16s)]
*  They're triggered by race. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=147.16s)]
*  They cry if you use the wrong pronoun. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=148.84s)]
*  And most fair-minded Americans look at this and they go, these people are about 10 exits [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=153.56s)]
*  past normal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=158.72s)]
*  And that's what's killing the Democrats right now, in my opinion. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=164.28s)]
*  No, I don't want to interrupt this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=165.84s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=167.56s)]
*  No, I'm done. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=168.56s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=169.56s)]
*  Okay, spending porn, and they got to try harder not to suck. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=170.56s)]
*  And I can't keep up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=176.44s)]
*  You know, one question people ask me about you, they're like, is this extemporaneous [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=177.44s)]
*  from Senator Kennedy? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=182.88s)]
*  Or is he actually, you think this out ahead of time? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=183.88s)]
*  Is this just flow naturally for you? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=186.28s)]
*  About five minutes before an interview, my staff knows to leave me alone. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=190.76s)]
*  If I know the topic, I start thinking about, I've got maybe four minutes, and I start thinking [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=196.48s)]
*  about how I'm going to frame it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=201.76s)]
*  Sometimes I say things that I shouldn't, but as I've told you before, God made me and God [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=205.48s)]
*  gave me the right to remain silent, but not the ability. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, I appreciate it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  But you know, it is interesting what you're saying, because what have they doubled down [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=217.44s)]
*  on? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  They doubled down on waste, fraud and abuse and corruption, which will end up being hundreds [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=222.68s)]
*  of billions, if not more. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=227.28s)]
*  They doubled down on men and women's sports and doubled down on putting the rights of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=229.4s)]
*  illegal immigrants, including known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=234.78s)]
*  over the safety of Americans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=239.96s)]
*  That's not, that's kind of dumb. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=241.96s)]
*  Well it is. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=246.12s)]
*  And frankly, it's bad for our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=247.12s)]
*  I mean, it's good for, I'm a Republican, it's good for my party. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=249.36s)]
*  What I tell my colleagues is, is just, look, we just need to stay calm. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=253.96s)]
*  We need to stay calm as a Hindu cow, and just go about our work, and get our bills passed, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=259.6s)]
*  and let the Democrats be the Democrats. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=267.38s)]
*  And so far it's working. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  You never interfere with your opponent when he's kicking his own ass. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=273.0s)]
*  So that's what's going on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=276.68s)]
*  I think that is very sound council advice, and if this is where, if they're not going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=280.0s)]
*  to look out for working men and women, and their safety and security, and their money, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=286.16s)]
*  I'm happy with them staying right where they are. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=291.8s)]
*  Bad for the country if they ever get power, but they're not in power. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=294.22s)]
*  Senator, we appreciate you more than you know. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=297.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDmE5wOBv8&t=306.68s)]
