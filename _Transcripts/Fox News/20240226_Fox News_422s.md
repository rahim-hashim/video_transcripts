# Sen. Kennedy: Biden’s had a ‘conga line’ of failures
**Fox News:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI)
*  I think you're going to love this one. Joe Biden has now declared a new public enemy, number one, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=0.0s)]
*  shrinkflation. Now, that's what he says happens when fewer items are placed in containers, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=4.96s)]
*  but the price remains the same, like when there's, you know, fewer chips in a bag. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=11.28s)]
*  Joe released a video about shrinkflation on the day of the Super Bowl, and apparently he's going [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to bring it up during the State of the Union address as well. But why the sudden focus on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=20.8s)]
*  the so-called issue? Well, it's obvious that Joe knows that everything that you buy is too expensive, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=25.6s)]
*  especially food, and he just doesn't want you to blame him for it. I thought he was bragging about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=31.44s)]
*  Bidenomics. Now, instead, just blame those nasty, greedy, you know, big corporations, big oil, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=36.96s)]
*  big farmer, big, big, big, but no big government. Again, the American people, they know better. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal pointing out, rightly so, a sad fact that Americans are now spending more [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=49.2s)]
*  of their incomes on food right now than at any other point in the past 30 years, since 1991, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=54.32s)]
*  to be specific. And that's all because of Joe Biden, Bidenomics, Biden inflation. Here with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=61.2s)]
*  reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is with us. Senator, good to have you back. Blame big oil, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=68.0s)]
*  blame big business. The border isn't his fault. Nothing's his fault. Everything is Trump's fault. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=73.68s)]
*  The border is safe and secure, but now it's Republicans' fault. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=80.16s)]
*  When you think of this number, that Americans spend more on food, more of their income as a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=84.32s)]
*  percentage on food than at any other point in the past 30 years, Senator, I think those people see [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=90.0s)]
*  and feel the real impact of Bidenomics in real time. Will he get away with this shifting of blame? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=97.68s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy. Sean, I did not think that President Obama was a very good president. But [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=105.52s)]
*  compared to President Biden, President Obama just shoplifted. President Biden stole the whole bank. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=116.24s)]
*  President Biden's inflation not only hurts people, but it hurts businesses. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Um, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=130.56s)]
*  shrink inflation exists when a business has to, needs to raise its prices because its costs have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=132.16s)]
*  gone up as a result of inflation, but it's scared to raise its prices because it's scared people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=138.4s)]
*  won't buy its product. So it saves money by making a smaller product. Um, unless you were, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=143.68s)]
*  were homeschooled by a day drinker, you can see that shrink inflation and inflation are just [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=151.92s)]
*  different sides of the same coin. And, and any economist, any reputable economist who didn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=160.64s)]
*  get his degree from Costco will tell you that President Biden's economic policies caused [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=167.6s)]
*  both inflation and shrink flation. Now, I don't, I don't hate anyone, and that includes President [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=175.04s)]
*  Biden. But when he tries to blame shrink flation and inflation on small business people, you have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=182.72s)]
*  to, to consider the source. Um, so, so much of the attention right now is on President Biden's age. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=189.84s)]
*  And it's true that it takes longer than a trip to Jupiter, uh, for him to walk across a stage, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=198.32s)]
*  but we can't lose sight of the fact that his economic policies have been almost every time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=205.68s)]
*  reliably and dependably wrong. And his inflation is a cancer on the American dream. And the American [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=214.16s)]
*  people have figured it out. And that's why if you believe the polls, the president is polling [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  right up there with, um, with Comedia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, Senator, I'm, California, for example, is suing oil companies. They have some of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=234.8s)]
*  highest oil prices in the country, gas prices in the country. Uh, Joe Biden has talked about doing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  the same thing. Now they're going after big business. Now they talk about corporate greed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Now they come up and coin a new term, shrink flation, and they want to blame everybody but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=249.36s)]
*  themselves. Uh, at what point do they ever take responsibility and say that the buck stops here? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=253.76s)]
*  I don't, I don't think they're willing to take responsibility for any of their policies. It's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=259.76s)]
*  their policies that has caused the economic downturn, caused 60 plus percent of the American [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  people now to live paycheck to paycheck. How do they get away with trying to shift that blame? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=270.48s)]
*  Well, look, it's time that, that we, uh, we're honest with ourselves, Sean. Uh, this president's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=276.88s)]
*  election is going to be president Trump versus president Biden. I've endorsed president Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=283.68s)]
*  When the media asked me why, I tell them it's not a choice between a Republican and a Democrat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=290.72s)]
*  It's a choice between hope and more hurt. And with president Biden, all we're going to get is more [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=296.48s)]
*  hurt, starting with the cost of going to the grocery store, continuing on with crime in the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=304.8s)]
*  streets, uh, the, the, the, the open bleeding wound at the border, the fact that our enemies [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=311.52s)]
*  no longer respect us, um, the sacrifice of our energy independence. I mean, it's been a, just [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=319.44s)]
*  a conga line of failures. It gives me no joy to say that, but that's the way the American people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=327.68s)]
*  see it. As I've said before, the American people may be poorer under president Biden, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  but they're not stupid. They had figured this out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=341.2s)]
*  Do you, do you really believe that now polls show that and polls show Joe's losing a large part of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=345.28s)]
*  the base of the democratic party. Do you think that holds? I think that a large part of the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  democratic party will probably stay home. That's what happens when a voter is not enthusiastic [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=358.0s)]
*  about his or her candidate. Um, if the election were held today, I think president Trump's vote [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=365.84s)]
*  would turn out. And I think a lot of the misgivings about president Biden, all well placed, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  would result in a lower voter turnout for his base. Do you think Donald Trump can bring in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=378.96s)]
*  independence, uh, that often swing elections? Well, once again, it's a choice between hope [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  or more heart, more hurt. And if people think back about how their lives were under president [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=393.6s)]
*  Trump and compare them to the debt today, um, I think they'll vote accordingly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=400.32s)]
*  All right, Senator Kennedy, always great to have you. Thank you for being with us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd54i4MNmNI&t=406.32s)]
