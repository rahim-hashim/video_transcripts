# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 3, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1.6s)]
*  A lot to get to. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=4.04s)]
*  Jam-packed show breaking just moments ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=5.12s)]
*  The port strike temporarily suspended [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=7.68s)]
*  until after the election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=11.56s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  More on that in moments. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=14.24s)]
*  But first, the stranding of America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=15.72s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=19.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=21.96s)]
*  Did Joe and Kamala care more [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=24.68s)]
*  about the millions of illegals [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=28.08s)]
*  coming across our border [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=30.84s)]
*  than the people struggling [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=32.84s)]
*  in the storm ravaged southeast? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=35.04s)]
*  Over the past four years, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=38.84s)]
*  Democrats led by Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=40.44s)]
*  racked up over $7.9 trillion in spending, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=43.16s)]
*  sending our national debt to over $35.6 trillion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=48.28s)]
*  But somehow, after all that spending, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=54.04s)]
*  it turns out we don't have the money [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=56.32s)]
*  we need to rescue and help our fellow Americans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=58.76s)]
*  We haven't seen FEMA. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=62.4s)]
*  We haven't seen Red Cross. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=64.2s)]
*  We haven't seen harbors with hands. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=65.84s)]
*  We've seen no agencies come through here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=67.88s)]
*  Most people drive through with their cameras out, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=70.4s)]
*  filming us like we're animals in a zoo [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=73.08s)]
*  and don't stop. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=75.72s)]
*  When this is allowed to happen, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  how do we even qualify as a superpower anymore? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=82.68s)]
*  How can the people running things [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=87.44s)]
*  be this heartless and this incompetent? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=89.48s)]
*  Ensuring that we have money and supplies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=93.84s)]
*  set aside for emergencies [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=96.2s)]
*  is a basic duty of government officials. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=97.72s)]
*  So we expect that when we allow our fellow citizens, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=100.64s)]
*  we help them when they're under siege [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=103.76s)]
*  by a natural disaster like this, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=105.6s)]
*  that our top officials will be fully engaged. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=108.28s)]
*  But as hurricane victims were waiting for relief, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=113.64s)]
*  Kamala was rallying supporters in Vegas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=116.24s)]
*  Six days after the lights went out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=121.52s)]
*  and the floodwaters rose in Georgia, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=123.32s)]
*  she did finally do a drop-by. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  Federal relief and assistance that we have been providing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=129.44s)]
*  has included FEMA providing $750 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=132.6s)]
*  for folks who need immediate needs being met, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=137.84s)]
*  such as food, baby formula, and the like. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=140.52s)]
*  Imagine losing your house, your transportation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=145.12s)]
*  basic necessities, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  and women looking for diapers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Earlier today, I was watching. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Most stores, by the way, in the area are wiped out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  And all you're getting right now is a $750 check, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=158.44s)]
*  she referenced, from the federal government, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=162.96s)]
*  the government you've been sending taxes to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=165.32s)]
*  for your entire life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and where are they gonna buy that baby food, Kamala? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=171.28s)]
*  Of course, the man who allowed the migrant invasion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=174.92s)]
*  into the U.S. is trying to pass the buck [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=177.0s)]
*  by saying, well, we're out of bucks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=179.64s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  with the money that we have. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=186.64s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=188.68s)]
*  We do not have the funds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=193.12s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=198.36s)]
*  They seem to have no hesitation [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=199.56s)]
*  about setting aside massive amounts of money [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=200.96s)]
*  for their foreign priorities. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=203.28s)]
*  If you want to see how sick and distorted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=206.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris' priorities are, just consider FEMA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=209.32s)]
*  Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  on housing for illegal migrants. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=218.24s)]
*  Now, Mayorkas, in a written statement today, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=221.48s)]
*  disputed these claims, saying that migrant money, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=223.76s)]
*  well, it had already been allocated. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=226.84s)]
*  Oh, big deal, I heard that, I was like, so? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=228.92s)]
*  And anyway, that's the point, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=231.72s)]
*  Democrats are prioritizing the needs of non-citizens. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  And now we learn many of them are violent, depraved criminals, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  prioritizing their needs ahead of the people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=244.32s)]
*  that our leaders are supposed to be serving. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=247.12s)]
*  Now, just over the past two years, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=250.88s)]
*  FEMA has spent more than a billion dollars to house illegals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  It allocated nearly 364 million just in fiscal year 2023. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=257.52s)]
*  And for fiscal year 2024, the figure is close to double that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=262.52s)]
*  And that helps illegals following their being released [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  all over the United States. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=272.24s)]
*  This is disgraceful. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=274.0s)]
*  And every Democrat running for office [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=277.88s)]
*  should be hammered for failing to shut this down, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=280.32s)]
*  for failing, of course, to secure the border, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=283.8s)]
*  could do it with a strike of a pen, right, Joe? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=286.12s)]
*  And for voting for their monster spending bills. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=289.48s)]
*  All they did was shortchange Americans, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=293.44s)]
*  drive up inflation, saddle us with debt [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  in order to give gobs of money to liberal special interests. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=300.88s)]
*  So why did Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=304.72s)]
*  think this was a good idea? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=307.36s)]
*  How about Sherrod Brown in Ohio? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin? Wisconsin? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=311.0s)]
*  Do they do any oversight up there on Capitol Hill? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  If not, why not? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  They say that in a crisis, you see what someone is made of. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=319.48s)]
*  Well, we need a cabinet stacked with brilliant, experienced people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=323.56s)]
*  But Kamala, of course, is going to sit and pick [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=329.8s)]
*  the same type of woke firsts that Biden picked. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=332.0s)]
*  The first this, the first that, forget the first resume. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=336.2s)]
*  The king of people who think getting a briefing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  is the same as leading. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=343.12s)]
*  I was at the FEMA command center a couple of days ago, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=346.6s)]
*  received a briefing alongside Secretary Mayorkas. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  The level of coordination and dedication going on out there [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=352.16s)]
*  is incredible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=354.92s)]
*  It's inspiring. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=355.72s)]
*  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that man was a Rhodes scholar. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=358.2s)]
*  Now, incompetence is the common denominator here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=364.2s)]
*  How else do you explain the fact that FEMA is still, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=366.92s)]
*  still approving new COVID expenditures? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=369.84s)]
*  We're still tracking the COVID fraud, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=374.32s)]
*  and they're still sending out money for COVID relief. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=376.44s)]
*  Again, everyone is asleep at the switch. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=379.48s)]
*  Zero oversight. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=383.0s)]
*  And by the way, if we had a curious, impartial media, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=385.68s)]
*  they would press Kamala Harris and Mayorkas [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=389.76s)]
*  on all of these questions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=393.4s)]
*  Look, we know what the press did to Bush and Katrina. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  But of course, look, the press right now [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=400.44s)]
*  is too busy trying to help Harris. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  Look what happened at that vice presidential debate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  with the moderators. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  But circling the wagons for her is really, really stupid. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=407.68s)]
*  Because given what's gone down, millions of voters [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=412.56s)]
*  may just start wondering whether this is just [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=416.88s)]
*  incompetent leadership with this Hurricane Helene, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=419.52s)]
*  or is it purposefully withholding aid from counties [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=424.24s)]
*  that supported Trump? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=427.8s)]
*  In the absence of leadership, conspiracy theories [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=429.64s)]
*  will, will just fly. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=433.2s)]
*  Now, this administration has been an epic failure. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=437.36s)]
*  We're seeing it play out. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=440.56s)]
*  And those responsible for leaving Americans [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  stranded in North Carolina, well, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  they're also responsible for stranding [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  the rest of the country with a flood of illegal aliens [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=450.0s)]
*  and, of course, just horrific inflation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=453.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Mayorkas, Yellen, Raimondo, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=457.12s)]
*  all of them should never be allowed [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=462.84s)]
*  near positions of power again. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=465.0s)]
*  Because after another four years of this, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  there'll be nothing left of the America we love. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=470.4s)]
*  So we can't wait. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  We have to rescue ourselves on November 5th. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=475.64s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=480.84s)]
*  And tonight, I've got to prepare all of you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=481.64s)]
*  to get very angry, because what we're about to share with you [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  will rightly make your blood boil. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=486.96s)]
*  As most of you know, ports, by the way, along the East Coast [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=489.56s)]
*  were shut down this week because of a union leader's demands. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=492.08s)]
*  We have the update on that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=496.76s)]
*  And including a reported 75% pay raise for dock workers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=498.48s)]
*  I think now the employers are up to 62%. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of them make six figures. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=507.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris supported this shutdown, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=509.32s)]
*  which cost you, the American people, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  is costing us billions of dollars a day. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=513.88s)]
*  They only kick the can down the road. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=515.76s)]
*  The strike is temporarily on hiatus. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=517.88s)]
*  But this story can get much, much worse. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=520.52s)]
*  As all of you know, much of Appalachia, the Gulf Coast, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=522.72s)]
*  from the Gulf Coast of Florida, reeling from Hurricane Helene. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=527.04s)]
*  This was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=531.48s)]
*  These regions desperately, desperately, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=534.16s)]
*  desperately need supplies coming through those ports, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  which are now backed up. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  Last weekend, Joe was sitting without a care in the world [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=542.9s)]
*  on the beach in his little beach chair. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris out hobnobbing with her rich Hollywood friends, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=547.4s)]
*  both for the most part, MIA in states that have been completely [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  devastated. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=554.68s)]
*  But here's the real problem. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  In North Carolina, in Georgia, in Tennessee, South Carolina, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=557.56s)]
*  and in the state of Florida, they need immediate help, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=561.4s)]
*  especially North Carolina and Georgia, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=565.12s)]
*  from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=567.92s)]
*  or what we call FEMA. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=571.0999999999999s)]
*  It has now been a full week. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=573.0s)]
*  And this is what we learned today. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=575.3599999999999s)]
*  FEMA is out of money. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  And wait till you hear the reason why. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=581.88s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs with the money [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=583.16s)]
*  that we have. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=587.76s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=589.0s)]
*  We do not have the funds. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=591.8s)]
*  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, you've got to remember, I interviewed [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Governor Kemp of Georgia. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  I interviewed Governor DeSantis, my state of Florida. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=602.52s)]
*  And they had both pre-positioned utility truck supplies. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=605.24s)]
*  Everybody knew that a massive category four hurricane [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=609.56s)]
*  was on the way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=613.0s)]
*  Joe and Kamala, they prepared for absolutely nothing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=613.72s)]
*  At the very least, they should have at least understood [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=618.48s)]
*  that they were going to run out of monies allocated [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=622.12s)]
*  for this storm. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=624.88s)]
*  And where did all the money go? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=626.12s)]
*  This is where your blood's really going to get hot. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=628.24s)]
*  Until last week, it was a relatively calm hurricane [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=630.56s)]
*  system. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=634.0s)]
*  And here's where this story gets infuriating and beyond [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=634.84s)]
*  disgraceful. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=638.44s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, we now have learned, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  raided FEMA's piggy bank for other endeavors. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=643.1199999999999s)]
*  They took over $1 billion of FEMA funds [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=647.28s)]
*  supposed to be available for national emergencies [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=651.52s)]
*  to help you, the American people, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=655.68s)]
*  if, God forbid, there's an emergency as bad as this one. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  And they spent all of that money on their 11.5 million [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants from over 180 other countries, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  by the way, including countries with terror ties [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=671.76s)]
*  and our top geopolitical foes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  And they use that money for free food, housing, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=676.16s)]
*  healthcare, education, sex change surgeries, debit cards, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  four-star hotels for illegal immigrants, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=685.12s)]
*  on top of the billions and billions they had already spent. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=688.28s)]
*  Now, there just aren't enough funds, what, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=691.68s)]
*  for the people of North Carolina, South Carolina, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=694.52s)]
*  our friends in Tennessee, our friends in Georgia, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  our friends here in the state of Florida? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  In the weeks since Helene, only $4 million [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  has been distributed to Americans devastated [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=705.84s)]
*  by the storm, person after person calling [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=709.2s)]
*  into my radio show saying, they haven't seen [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=712.08s)]
*  a single emergency worker, FEMA representative, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=714.44s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=717.2s)]
*  Hundreds of Americans we know lost their lives. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=718.36s)]
*  Hundreds are now unaccounted for and missing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=721.64s)]
*  People don't have homes, they don't have food, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=724.96s)]
*  they don't have water, they don't have housing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=727.32s)]
*  Up until Donald Trump contacted Elon Musk, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  they didn't have any communications. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=733.28s)]
*  They've been completely abandoned by your border czar [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=735.32s)]
*  who prioritized her unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=739.08s)]
*  over the American people and hasn't lifted a finger [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  in over a week. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=746.64s)]
*  And now we find out a week later they don't have any money? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  The little money that they have given out [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=751.04s)]
*  is described as a one-time grant [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=753.56s)]
*  that gives storm victims a lousy, what, $750? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  Can they open their eyes? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=761.92s)]
*  Are they not aware of the devastation? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't even know how many other people [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=765.7199999999999s)]
*  are in deep trouble, because they can't get to them [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=768.92s)]
*  and they haven't put the resources forward to get to them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=771.76s)]
*  You have the illegal immigrants getting everything, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=775.4s)]
*  including free sex change operations, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=777.56s)]
*  courtesy of you, the taxpayer, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=779.64s)]
*  while American citizens in North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=781.56s)]
*  Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina lost everything [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=785.16s)]
*  and they get nothing but the middle finger from Joe Biden [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=788.52s)]
*  and border czar Kamala Harris. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=792.52s)]
*  Let me be clear, this is rightly Kamala's Katrina [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=794.36s)]
*  on steroids and human growth hormone. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=798.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=801.12s)]
*  they've allocated close to $200 billion to Ukraine, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=803.84s)]
*  $8 billion more just last week. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  How about we withhold that payment [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=810.8399999999999s)]
*  and give it to the people of North Carolina, Georgia [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=812.56s)]
*  that are devastated? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  This is an administration that has given [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=816.16s)]
*  nearly $3 billion to the Taliban [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=818.68s)]
*  and they can't help our own citizens? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  The Taliban, the ones that have billions of dollars [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=825.04s)]
*  on our military equipment [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=828.24s)]
*  and still they're Americans caught behind enemy lines [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=829.92s)]
*  and so many of our allies, well, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=833.3599999999999s)]
*  they were taken out of their homes [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=835.4799999999999s)]

*  never to be seen or heard from again. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  230 million to build a floating pier on a beach in Gaza, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=840.64s)]
*  that's what Harris and Biden did for them, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=845.36s)]
*  to rush food supplies to the Palestinians and Hamas. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=848.0s)]
*  That pier was only operational for 20 days. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=852.44s)]
*  Joe and Kamala sent another 211 million [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=855.2s)]
*  in humanitarian assistance that was sent to Haiti this year, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  45 million to help tackle gang violence. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=862.24s)]
*  The administration gives over a billion dollars every year. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=866.04s)]
*  Let's go through some of the countries, the list is longer, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=869.36s)]
*  Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Somalia, southern Sudan [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=872.16s)]

*  But Katrina Kamala stays MIA, throws crumbs [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=879.8399999999999s)]
*  to the people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  Tennessee, Florida, especially in North Georgia, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=887.92s)]
*  Northern North Carolina. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=891.56s)]
*  Oh, why is that? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=894.8s)]
*  Because it's Republican areas? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=895.7199999999999s)]
*  What a repulsive disgrace. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=897.76s)]
*  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he's a pretty mild mannered guy, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=900.0s)]
*  baffled, stunned by the White House [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=903.88s)]
*  that refused to issue an emergency declaration offer [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  that he asked for, for 90 counties in Georgia [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=910.04s)]
*  that were devastated by this hurricane. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=914.0s)]
*  He needed that declaration for 90 counties. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  They only gave him 11. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=919.16s)]
*  He had to get back on the phone with the White House [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  and begging Biden's chief of staff, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=923.64s)]
*  Joe was probably taking a nap, to take more action. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=925.68s)]
*  And he only got 30 more of the 90 counties [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=928.96s)]
*  that he needed covered. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=931.72s)]
*  Again, the middle finger to Georgia, North Carolina [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  and everyone in between. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=936.56s)]
*  Wow, pretty unbelievable. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=938.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=939.76s)]
*  When the first emergency declarations came down, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=941.16s)]
*  there was only 11 counties in that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people were outraged, including me, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=946.56s)]
*  because there was such devastation in, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=948.96s)]
*  you know, up to 90 counties. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=951.28s)]
*  So we called the White House, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=953.36s)]
*  we spoke to the president's chief of staff, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=954.6s)]
*  the FEMA administrator and said, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=957.44s)]
*  look, you're sending the signal [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=959.72s)]
*  that you're not paying attention [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=961.44s)]
*  to some of these rural communities. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=963.32s)]
*  Egypt's abandoning Georgia, North Carolina [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=965.92s)]
*  and every state in between. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=968.48s)]
*  Everybody knew this hurricane was coming. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=969.96s)]
*  Governor Kemp did his job, pre-positioned utility trucks, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=973.48s)]
*  supplies available for the people of Georgia. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=976.76s)]
*  Governor DeSantis did the same thing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=979.2s)]
*  Everyone knew it would be a major cat three, four storm. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=981.28s)]
*  Where was the federal government? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=985.44s)]
*  And why didn't we find out till today [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=987.36s)]
*  that FEMA ran out of money? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=989.84s)]
*  And why didn't Biden and Harris pre-position a thing? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=991.76s)]
*  And why did they, you know, reallocate these funds [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=995.08s)]
*  to help the 11 and a half illegals [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=998.6s)]
*  that shouldn't be in the country anyway? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1000.48s)]
*  Why did they raid FEMA funds for illegals? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1002.52s)]
*  Why isn't FEMA on the ground in these areas [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1005.36s)]
*  in North Carolina, South Carolina, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  Tennessee, Georgia and Florida now? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1011.28s)]
*  And I'll say this, God bless the Reverend Billy, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1013.8s)]
*  Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son and Samaritan's Purse. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1016.56s)]
*  Thank God, I donated to them this week myself. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  If you wanna go to samaritanspurse.org, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1022.8s)]
*  they need your help. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1024.76s)]
*  And thank God for Donald Trump. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1026.04s)]
*  He actually got on the ground long before Kamala and Joe [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1028.2s)]
*  and then saw the devastation, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1031.44s)]
*  got on the phone with his friend, Elon Musk. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1033.04s)]
*  And Elon Musk, you know, sent in Starlink [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1035.6399999999999s)]
*  to establish communications [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1038.48s)]
*  where there was none at all whatsoever. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1040.04s)]
*  There would be zero help. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1042.8s)]
*  People would be dying without communications. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1044.2s)]
*  And according to numerous reports on the ground, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1047.2s)]
*  the administration has been so painfully slow. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1049.4s)]
*  They're not even there now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1051.84s)]
*  And leaving Americans to suffer [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1053.68s)]
*  and fend for themselves in communities, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1056.04s)]
*  now without roads, bridges, power, food, clean water. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1058.64s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1063.0s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1063.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1064.8s)]
*  We've seen our friends and neighbors lose their homes. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1066.12s)]
*  We've seen classrooms of children [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1070.7199999999998s)]
*  who have no longer have their homes. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1074.04s)]
*  We are hunting for teachers. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1078.28s)]
*  We have 23 teachers out of our list [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1080.6s)]

*  And we've never experienced anything like this. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1091.56s)]
*  Is there anything you'd love to make sure [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1095.48s)]
*  that they know, both President Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1096.96s)]

*  This is her Katrina. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1121.16s)]
*  In many areas across the Southeast, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1122.76s)]
*  communications have been totally down. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1125.76s)]

*  Last year, let's follow the bouncing ball, shall we? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1129.56s)]
*  The same Biden-Harris administration rescinded [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1133.36s)]
*  a Starlink contract, that's Elon Musk's company, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1136.6s)]

*  save the astronauts that are lost in space [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1145.28s)]

*  They clearly revoked the deal with Elon Musk [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1161.08s)]
*  for political reasons, so now Musk gets a call from Trump, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1163.8s)]
*  is working, and to his credit, he's been able [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1168.32s)]
*  to rush Starlink terminals to the region [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1170.84s)]

*  Can I give you more money? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1185.76s)]
*  Because the communications, we don't even know [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1187.32s)]
*  if people are without food and water and about to die [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1189.6s)]

*  that disaster relief aid should be provided [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1210.52s)]
*  on the basis of race and equity? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1213.64s)]
*  We're gonna play politics and insert DEI [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  into disaster relief? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1220.8s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1224.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1225.44s)]
*  It is our lowest income communities [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1226.64s)]
*  and our communities of color that are most impacted [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1230.4s)]
*  by these extreme conditions and impacted [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1234.68s)]
*  by issues that are not of their own making. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1239.08s)]
*  And so we have to address this in a way [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  that is about giving resources based on equity, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  understanding that we fight for equality, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1251.04s)]
*  but we also need to fight for equity, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1253.4399999999998s)]
*  understanding not everyone starts out at the same place. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  And if we want people to be in an equal place, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1257.7199999999998s)]
*  sometimes we have to take into account those disparities. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1260.0s)]
*  How about in a situation like this, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1263.76s)]
*  how about we all band together, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1265.9599999999998s)]
*  you help out any and every American based on their need, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1267.84s)]
*  and you do it as soon as possible, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1271.36s)]
*  and don't sit on your ass for a week like they have. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1272.9199999999998s)]
*  How about you don't steal money for illegal immigrants [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1275.36s)]
*  for their sex change operations, free housing, healthcare, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1279.0s)]
*  food, education, et cetera, and amnesty, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1282.52s)]
*  and you leave the money where it belongs, in a lockbox, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1285.48s)]
*  for emergencies when they happen, for FEMA? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  Do the people of Appalachia just not look the right way? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1292.72s)]
*  Maybe you don't like how they vote historically, you know, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1295.8s)]
*  and they don't deserve federal aid. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  They're Americans. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1301.08s)]
*  They are desperately in need and have been for a week, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  and you have abandoned them. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1305.56s)]
*  In the past four years, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1307.32s)]
*  Kamala has passionately called for billions of dollars, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1308.6399999999999s)]
*  let's see, to repay student debt, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1311.6399999999999s)]
*  provide sex change operations, not only for illegals, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1313.48s)]
*  but also convicts in jail, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  vowed to eliminate the filibuster to spend $93 trillion [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1319.04s)]
*  on the Green New Deal, a cradle to grave society. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1323.56s)]
*  By the way, any of you out there [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  wanna trust your government? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  When it comes to hurricane victims, the passion is gone. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1329.44s)]
*  No desperate pleas for funding. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1332.6399999999999s)]
*  She didn't even bother to step away [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1334.32s)]
*  from her lavish Hollywood fundraisers over the weekend. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1336.08s)]
*  Biden wouldn't come back from the beach. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1339.56s)]
*  Too lazy to get his ass out of that beach chair [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1342.08s)]
*  and do his job. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1344.52s)]
*  It took Kamala and Joe a week to visit the Southeast. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1345.8s)]
*  Remember 2005, George W. Bush mocked, ridiculed, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1349.04s)]
*  called racist for his hurricane response [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1352.2s)]
*  to Hurricane Katrina? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1356.24s)]
*  The criticism was on day two, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1357.8s)]
*  the second day after it occurred. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1360.28s)]
*  According to the New York Times, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1362.6000000000001s)]
*  he was blasted for not returning to Washington [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1364.0s)]
*  from his Texas vacation until Wednesday afternoon, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1366.8s)]
*  two days after the Monday hurricane. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1369.56s)]
*  Well, and he flew over Katrina, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1372.04s)]
*  didn't wanna land and be a distraction. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1373.88s)]
*  Well, this is Kamala's Katrina. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  She and Biden are failing the people of the Southeast. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1377.64s)]
*  She prioritized the illegal immigrants over you, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1380.72s)]
*  the American people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1383.56s)]
*  She talks a big game about equity, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1384.96s)]
*  but doesn't seem to give a damn [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1386.68s)]
*  when people are truly in need. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1388.56s)]
*  And today, former President Trump said [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1390.48s)]
*  that this has been the worst hurricane response [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1392.24s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1394.3600000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1395.68s)]
*  Now we have a horrific disaster in North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1396.96s)]
*  South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida and Virginia. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1400.44s)]
*  That's how big this hurricane was. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1404.84s)]
*  And the Harris Biden administration says [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1406.92s)]
*  they don't have any money. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1409.84s)]
*  They've spent it all on, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1411.28s)]
*  they spent all of their money, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1413.6399999999999s)]
*  they have almost no money [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1414.72s)]
*  because they spent it all on illegal migrants. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1416.56s)]
*  This is the worst response in the history of hurricanes. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  The President is right. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1424.84s)]
*  And sadly, tonight as we speak, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1425.9199999999998s)]
*  Americans from North Carolina all the way down to Florida [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1427.4399999999998s)]
*  in the Southeast continue to suffer. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1430.8s)]
