# Biden is doing everything to ‘muck up’ Trump’s plans, says former GOP senator
**Fox News:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY)
*  to the U.S. Virgin Islands. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=0.0s)]
*  Here now with reaction, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=2.2s)]
*  former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=3.84s)]
*  Senator, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=7.24s)]
*  So as the world further degrades [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=8.92s)]
*  with one crisis after another, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=11.56s)]
*  Joe Biden jets off to another luxury vacation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=15.0s)]
*  Is this the most idle absentee president [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=19.6s)]
*  in modern American history? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, Greg, it's great to see you [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=27.06s)]
*  and happy new year to everybody. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  I hope everyone had a good Christmas. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course it is, but it's no surprise. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=33.62s)]
*  Here's my post-Christmas wish [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  is that he leaves all the pens and all the phones [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=38.54s)]
*  and every communication device at home [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=41.3s)]
*  so he can't do more cash for kids, judges, you know, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=43.78s)]
*  being pardoned or other types of things [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=47.82s)]
*  that are going to affect President Trump's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=50.22s)]
*  incoming opportunities, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=52.06s)]
*  whether it's dealing with the illegals [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=53.58s)]
*  and giving them additional privileges [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=55.34s)]
*  and rights that they're not entitled to, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  whether it's doing things like this, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=59.580000000000005s)]
*  which is the inaction that we've seen. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=61.1s)]
*  It's no surprise. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a little bit scary, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=64.38000000000001s)]
*  but you know, I'm counting down the days [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  like everybody else. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Just leave the pens at home [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  so he can't sign anything else, please. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=69.92s)]
*  You know, I looked this up today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=71.94s)]
*  40% of Joe Biden's presidency has been spent on vacation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=73.66s)]
*  That is roughly 550 days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=80.94s)]
*  Now, if you do a little math, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=83.94s)]
*  it would take the average American 48 years [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=85.98s)]
*  to rack up that many vacation days. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=89.58s)]
*  As you sort of look back on the last four years, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=94.34s)]
*  is it a little bit frightening that we had a president [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=96.7s)]
*  who mentally and physically wasn't even there? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=102.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, listen, I've said he's been on vacation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=108.94s)]
*  for more than four years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  I noted when he first got elected [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=112.62s)]
*  that he was in diminished capacity [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=115.06s)]
*  and we should all be very concerned. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=116.9s)]
*  And our foes see it, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=118.54s)]
*  they all see it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=121.7s)]
*  That's why you're seeing a lot of the unrest. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=122.54s)]
*  You see, obviously, as you referenced in your opening, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=124.22s)]
*  you know, a Chinese ship dragging their anchor [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=126.7s)]
*  to create havoc with cables, certainly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=129.82s)]
*  What's happening with China and Taiwan, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=132.70000000000002s)]
*  what's happening in Ukraine [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=134.5s)]
*  when Biden really didn't do what he needed to do [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  with regard to Russia, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=138.22s)]
*  kind of gave him a green light. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=139.38s)]
*  Just a little incursion would be okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=140.92s)]
*  And those types of things would never happen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=143.28s)]
*  under President Trump [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=145.55999999999997s)]
*  and did not happen under President Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=146.64s)]
*  The Middle East was quiet. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=149.0s)]
*  The relationship with China and North Korea [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=151.2s)]
*  was the best it's ever been. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  And we need to get back to that time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's what people are hoping for. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when Trump left office, there were no major wars. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=159.16s)]
*  Foreign policy was handled, I think, pretty well. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Biden takes office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=167.94s)]
*  He orders immediately the disastrous withdrawal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  in Afghanistan and his perceived weakness then, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=173.44s)]
*  I think, triggered international strife and wars. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Russia, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, they were all emboldened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=181.68s)]
*  So is Donald Trump now inheriting a foreign policy mess? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=185.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, when President Trump was in charge, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  when I was his ambassador to New Zealand, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Cook, Newey and Samoa, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=197.28s)]
*  he had one arm tied behind his back. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  He got barely half of his appointees approved. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=200.82s)]
*  Well, now he has the opportunity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=203.62s)]
*  That's why he's jumping right out of the gate, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=204.94s)]
*  making these great appointments. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=206.94s)]
*  And of course, Biden's doing everything he can to muck it up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=208.62s)]
*  He's doing it with the illegals that are here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=211.94s)]
*  He's trying to give them additional benefits [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=213.6s)]
*  and rights and privileges that they're not entitled to. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=215.94s)]
*  You see what's happening with Iran and Russia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=218.8s)]
*  They've had a relationship, certainly, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=221.06s)]
*  but now it's even stronger. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=223.06s)]
*  But the good news is, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=224.86s)]
*  is that they're both weakened through sanctions [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=226.02s)]
*  and obviously what Israel has done [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=228.02s)]
*  to basically eliminate Iran's satellite terrorist groups [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=230.18s)]
*  when they try to export terrorism [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=234.8s)]
*  around the region and the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  So while they're doing something officially, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=238.18s)]
*  it's been like that for quite a few years, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  especially during this administration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  They share technology, US secrets. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=244.18s)]
*  They give weapons, Iran gives weapons systems to Iran [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=246.94s)]
*  and Russia gives cover to them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  So it's been a relationship. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=252.94s)]
*  I'm concerned about the Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=254.46s)]
*  the kind of axis of new evil, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  people that don't want the United States [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=262.06s)]
*  and Western countries, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=263.7s)]
*  Western hemisphere countries to survive. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=264.94s)]
*  Scott Brown, many thanks for being with us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=266.94s)]
*  Happy New Year to you and your family. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=269.42s)]
*  Appreciate your being with us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwHdpe3cY&t=271.3s)]
