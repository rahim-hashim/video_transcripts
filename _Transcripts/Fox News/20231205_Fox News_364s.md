# FBI investigated Catholics for potential terrorism, House committee report claims
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk)
*  Now, two breaking news out of the weaponized and politicized FBI of Joe Biden, a brand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  new report from FoxNews.com revealing that the Bureau's targeting of Catholics was far [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=5.24s)]
*  worse than the FBI Director Ray would have you believe as a part of its federal fishing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=10.16s)]
*  expedition into so-called traditional Catholics. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=15.6s)]
*  The FBI apparently interrogated at least one priest, an acquired director. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=18.56s)]
*  The latest on this is the chairman of the very important House Judiciary Committee, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=24.72s)]
*  Jim Jordan is with us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=29.88s)]
*  Okay, acquired director? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=31.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=33.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=34.2s)]
*  So how bad did this get? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=35.2s)]
*  Well, first they told us it was just one field office, the Richmond field office. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=36.2s)]
*  Then we learned that, oh no, no, it was bigger than that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=41.08s)]
*  It was multiple field offices involved in this attack on pro-life Catholics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=43.64s)]
*  And now we learn, as you pointed out, Sean, that the FBI was talking to a priest and acquired [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  director. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  Now again, remember the larger context. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  This is the same FBI that spied on President Trump's campaign. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=55.92s)]
*  This is the same FBI that censored Americans. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=59.44s)]
*  This is the same FBI on this particular issue that went to Mark Halk's home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=61.44s)]
*  A pro-life Catholic arrested him in his home in front of his wife and seven children. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  When that case goes to court, Mark Halk wins, which is, that's how ridiculous this all is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=71.64s)]
*  So that's what our report spells out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=77.8s)]
*  Well, Congressman, let me ask you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  It shows that the FBI wasn't being square with us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  So you subpoenaed documents that you had, that you subpoenaed, show there was no legitimate [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=82.44s)]
*  basis for the memorandum to insert federal law enforcement into Catholic houses of worship. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=88.76s)]
*  Then why did they do that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  This is whole mind. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Remember when Joe Biden stood in front of Independence Hall and talked about how one [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  half of the country is fascist? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=101.0s)]
*  It's this whole mindset. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=103.48s)]
*  If you're, if you're pro-life, if you're a traditional Catholic, somehow you're radical, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=104.48s)]
*  somehow you're an extremist. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  Remember, this is part of the justice department that said, if you're a mom and dad going to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  a school board meeting, you're an extremist as well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=114.44s)]
*  So this is the mindset. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=117.18s)]
*  This is what's so scary. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=119.2s)]
*  And this is why we don't want to give them more money for a new headquarters and why [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=120.2s)]
*  we've formed this committee to look at all the things they have done in this area. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=122.92s)]
*  And of course, in the censorship area. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  Can I ask you, in light of what happened in the summer of 2020, 574 riots, dozens of dead [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=129.52s)]
*  Americans, thousands of injured cops hit with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=136.24s)]
*  billions in property damage. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=141.4s)]
*  There was no committee set up for those riots, Congressman. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=143.16s)]
*  And yet we're using limited resources of the FBI for this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=147.44s)]
*  That's, that's, that's what they're investigating. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=152.04s)]
*  Why didn't they use the videotape of all those people involved in the riots in the summer [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=154.96s)]
*  of 2020 and have a committee like the January 6th committee? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=158.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=163.0s)]
*  Because we've been consistent, you've been consistent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=164.0s)]
*  We've condemned violence every time it's happened. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=165.88s)]
*  We said it was wrong in the summer of 2020. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=168.24s)]
*  And those who committed violence on January 6th, we said that was wrong. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=170.44s)]
*  But here's this FBI. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=173.8s)]
*  I use the example again of Mark Halk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=175.28s)]
*  Praying in front of an abortion clinic, they decide to go into his home, arrest, he was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=178.04s)]
*  willing to turn himself in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=182.88s)]
*  His counsel said so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=184.16s)]
*  And they go into his home, arrest him in front of his wife and children. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=185.64s)]
*  That is not how you're supposed to operate in this great country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=189.74s)]
*  Again, it's why we're doing the work we're doing and making sure we get the facts out [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=192.64s)]
*  there and beginning to change its behavior. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=196.08s)]
*  Can we, can you tell me why and how this is happening? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=198.76s)]
*  When you think of the FBI's involvement, you know, in terms of in the lead up to the election [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=203.16s)]
*  in 2020, and the FBI was meeting months before with all the big tech corporations, warning [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  them they may be victims of a disinformation campaign about Joe and Hunter Biden. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=215.6s)]
*  And lo and behold, they, by the way, they knew Rudy Giuliani had a copy of Hunter's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  laptop. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=225.28s)]
*  They knew that story was going to break. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=226.28s)]
*  Then when Facebook and Twitter asked for confirmation, is this real or not, they would not answer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=228.44s)]
*  when in fact they knew it was absolutely real. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=234.96s)]
*  Why do you think they did that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=238.44s)]
*  And why is not anybody being held accountable? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=239.72s)]
*  Why is the FBI now for two presidential cycles in a row, in the case of James Comey, protecting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=242.78s)]
*  Hillary and emails, et cetera? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=248.28s)]
*  Why is the FBI getting involved in our elections? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=251.4s)]
*  I think the reason they did that particular case is because it involved, involved Joe [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=254.48s)]
*  Biden's son. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=257.62s)]
*  It's the same reason we have a five year investigation into Hunter Biden and they had to go to a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=258.62s)]
*  special counsel after five years of investigating. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=262.54s)]
*  I actually think that whole case, I think they'd have got away with it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=265.1s)]
*  I think it all been cleared through, but for two brave whistleblowers who by the way are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=268.62s)]
*  going to get more information to the Ways and Means Committee tomorrow, but for Shapley [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=272.9s)]
*  and Ziegler, I think they get away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=276.78s)]
*  And for that judge in Delaware, I think the reason they did it all was because it was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=278.62s)]
*  about the Bidens. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=282.06s)]
*  That's the whole point here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  So that, that is why I think they did it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  And it was worse yet, Sean, the US attorney in Pittsburgh who was supposed to be the clearinghouse [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  for all information in 2020 relative to Hunter Biden and Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  When we deposed Mr. Brady, he told us that when I asked him, I said, when did you find [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  out about the laptop? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=301.5s)]
*  And you think that's pretty important information. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=302.5s)]
*  They'd have told the US attorney who was supposed to be the guy in our government who filters [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=304.14s)]
*  that information, clears it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=307.68s)]
*  I asked him, when did you learn about the laptop? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=309.62s)]
*  He said, when the story went public. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=311.38s)]
*  Did the FBI in 2016 protect Hillary Clinton? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  Are they applying a different standard in terms of classified information now to Donald [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=322.58s)]
*  Number one. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=323.58s)]
*  And in 2020, when they were talking to big tech companies, did they censor information [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=324.58s)]
*  they knew was true? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=330.5s)]
*  Did they actively work to do that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=331.62s)]
*  We have 20 seconds. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=333.46s)]
*  Well, they kept it from Scott Brady, so I sure think they did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=334.46s)]
*  And of course, in 2020, it was worse than what you described because they spied on President [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=337.22s)]
*  Trump's campaign, for goodness sake. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=341.3s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  It just, this has to be fixed if we're going to ever have equal justice under the law. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=345.82000000000005s)]
*  Jim Jordan, thank you, sir. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86dJPh-5Gk&t=351.14000000000004s)]
