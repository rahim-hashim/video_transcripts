# ‘Every city’ should be prepared for attacks like New Orleans: Sen. Bill Cassidy
**Fox News:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew)
*  Joining us now, Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=0.0s)]
*  So, you know, we spoke—thanks for joining me, sir. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=3.92s)]
*  We spoke with the governor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=6.76s)]
*  I broached this a little bit, but it seems that, you know, some of the most—for Americans [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=8.0s)]
*  watching this, it was a very basic kind of thing that you would have up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=13.8s)]
*  And yet, we were also focused on New Year's Eve in New York. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=18.78s)]
*  I've argued for quite some time that we get a tunnel vision, thinking that New York [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=22.04s)]
*  is the only target. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=26.72s)]
*  Whereas, in fact, every great American city, every walk of life in this country, needs [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=28.84s)]
*  to be where—what are your thoughts after a day like today? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=34.32s)]
*  Sam, you nailed it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=37.24s)]
*  People say, oh, my gosh, the Super Bowl is going to be in New Orleans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=40.32s)]
*  I tell them, it doesn't matter what city the Super Bowl is in. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=43.58s)]
*  You've got a lot of soft targets, and it's going to be relatively easy for someone who's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=47.66s)]
*  motivated and creative to hit those. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=52.68s)]
*  In New York, of course, after 9-11, they're so aware of it, but other cities, perhaps, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=55.52s)]
*  not so much. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=60.88s)]
*  And so, you just assume you block the street, and people won't drive on the sidewalk. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=62.28s)]
*  It turns out—wrong assumption. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=65.68s)]
*  That's what the guy did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  That's how the guy killed 15 people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=68.72s)]
*  But you nailed it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=71.16s)]
*  It's every city that has that—that should have that concern now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, and just, I think, a few weeks before, if not a month, maybe in November, but there [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=76.36s)]
*  was a shooting at a parade in New Orleans. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=81.4s)]
*  The New Orleans PD and the city, they understand there's been a violence issue. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=85.58s)]
*  So this wasn't, in a way, out of the blue. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=91.14s)]
*  And that's, I think, what breaks the heart. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=94.88s)]
*  You know, New Orleans, people love New Orleans. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=96.38s)]
*  It's a special city for Americans and for people around the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=98.94s)]
*  The video that we've been seeing, a woman standing in shock, video from a balcony, and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=103.1s)]
*  she's standing in shock over what would appear to be a body that we have blanked out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=108.58s)]
*  But the lives ruined, the lives ended, the lives ruined that will never be the same, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  it's the kind of thing that ISIS and al-Qaeda thrive on and thirst for. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=120.2s)]
*  And we should be able to protect, you know, soft targets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=126.36s)]
*  Or do you—we do worry also about we want to be a free country and we don't want to, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  you know, ruin people's fun. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=136.8s)]
*  And then we've got the sugar bowl tomorrow. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=139.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts about the degree of security that should be there? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=140.96s)]
*  First, let me start where you started. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Any time there is a street festival in a city, you're going to have soft targets. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  Any time you have large groups of people kind of crossing from one side to the other—I'm [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=155.08s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., one day, and they're having a parade, July 4th, a few years ago, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=159.4s)]
*  or something like that—and there's just people lining the streets. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Someone highly motivated could have come in and caused damage. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=168.16s)]
*  Now, by the way, D.C. has closed circuit TV all over the place. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=170.92s)]
*  The police would be right there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  But there was 300 police officers in the French Quarter last night. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=177.28s)]
*  Yes, true. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=181.04s)]
*  And a highly motivated, creative person couldn't stop that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=182.04s)]
*  Now that said—and again, you nailed it, too—in a free society, in a free society, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=185.64s)]
*  we give up a little bit of security because otherwise, I mean, who wants to go from one [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=190.88s)]
*  checkpoint to the other? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=194.96s)]
*  But every now and then you pay the price for that freedom. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=196.6s)]
*  And you know— [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=199.32s)]
*  OK, that hates our freedom. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=200.32s)]
*  And the inspiration that comes from the defund the police movement, the demonizing of law [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=201.32s)]
*  enforcement, the lack of leadership at the federal level, the open border, whether you're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=207.8s)]
*  coming across the border or not, there's so many messages that America doesn't care [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=213.08s)]
*  about itself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=218.2s)]
*  And, you know, just like in New York, yes, the police are everywhere, but we've had [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=219.2s)]
*  a guy pushed under a train just yesterday, a woman set on fire in the subway. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  There's messaging, it seems, sir, for people who are ready to tip over, you know, the assassination [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=229.72s)]
*  attempts on President Trump, that do it because nobody cares. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Won't leadership make a difference here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=240.84s)]
*  It will. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  By the way, way back when, there was an essay or a study, a broken windows theory. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=246.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  And it found that if you tolerated little crimes, you ended up with big crimes that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  followed. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=258.44s)]
*  If you didn't tolerate the little crimes, the big crimes didn't come as much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=259.44s)]
*  So if you tolerate a little graffiti, you get a lot of graffiti. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=263.6s)]
*  If you erase it as soon as it comes up, you stop getting graffiti. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=267.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=270.36s)]
*  So the point being, leadership needs to say that we're not going to tolerate the crime, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=271.36s)]
*  that the soft on crime district attorneys wherever you are need to be replaced. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=275.88s)]
*  The blue states, the blue cities that have been soft on crime, they're paying the price. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=280.4s)]
*  And I think we're getting bigger crimes because of this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=284.76s)]
*  I can't say this wouldn't have happened. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=287.12s)]
*  This guy was, you know, very activated by ISIS apparently. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=289.08s)]
*  But a lot of our other crime problems can end. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=292.96s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=295.84s)]
*  A lot of work to do, but we are ready to get going on that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=296.84s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much for joining me tonight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGsRsApyew&t=300.28s)]
