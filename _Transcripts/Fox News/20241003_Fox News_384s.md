# 'Frightening': Melania Trump speaks out on her husband's assassination attempt
**Fox News:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM)
*  Last night we showed you part one of my interview with former First Lady Melania Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=0.0s)]
*  We discussed her new book Melania and the assassination attempts against her husband. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=6.12s)]
*  Here's part two. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=10.84s)]
*  Let me get to the assassination. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=13.08s)]
*  And I watched your interview with Ainsley and it was, I watched the full hour and I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=15.24s)]
*  watched it on the morning show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=19.04s)]
*  I know where I was at that time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=23.0s)]
*  When I saw the blood, and I've been a shooter my whole life, I thought that maybe he got [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=26.36s)]
*  hit much worse. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=33.16s)]
*  Did you think that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=34.84s)]
*  I thought that too. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=35.84s)]
*  Who saw the blood? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=36.84s)]
*  First of all, when he was on the floor for a while and you don't know for those seconds, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=39.36s)]
*  minutes, you don't know what's really going on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=46.2s)]
*  You don't know that, I didn't know that he was hitting the ear. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  You always question what it could be. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=54.36s)]
*  And so it was really frightening. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=58.32s)]
*  And you know, the life stops in that few minutes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Was really very difficult. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=69.68s)]
*  And you found out shortly thereafter he was okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=72.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=75.76s)]
*  So then West Palm Beach happens at Trump International, the golf course. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=78.76s)]
*  So I want to be very, very clear, and both you and President Trump have praised his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Secret Service. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=91.56s)]
*  The guys in Butler that dove on him, and they actually hurt him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of an untold story. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Ernie was black and blue, beaten up pretty bad. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=98.4s)]
*  And they were amazing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=102.12s)]
*  They were heroic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  The Bible tells us, no greater love hath man but to lay down their life for another, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=105.56s)]
*  right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=110.48s)]
*  And they will risk their lives for your husband in this case. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=111.48s)]
*  And they were amazing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=115.04s)]
*  And they were amazing in West Palm Beach. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=116.16s)]
*  I had gone to breakfast that morning with the president's golf partner, Steve Whitcomb. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=118.72s)]
*  And he told me the whole story. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Here's where I get angry and I want answers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=126.84s)]
*  And I saw your video that you put out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=130.7s)]
*  How is it possible that a would-be assassin gets 130 yards away on the top of a roof in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=133.62s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania, with an AR-15 and a rangefinder and gets all four shots at your [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=142.62s)]
*  husband and comes within a millimeter of assassinating him? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  West Palm Beach, this is a known area around holes four, five, six, seven, where paparazzi [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=157.7s)]
*  would hang out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  So it would have been less than 300 yards, probably, by the time this would-be assassin [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=166.56s)]
*  took a shot at your husband. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=172.2s)]
*  It is a colossal failure. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  The agents around your husband were heroes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=176.5s)]
*  They were. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=180.16s)]
*  They were fantastic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=181.16s)]
*  But they didn't sweep the area. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=182.16s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=183.56s)]
*  Those men with my husband and with me, the men with me and my husband, they are fantastic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  But I feel it's the top leadership that there are some holes and there are some problems. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  So it comes from the top leadership that happened. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=197.54s)]
*  And I know and I have a knowledge about that our team ask many times for more security, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=202.82s)]
*  for more help. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  And they were denied. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=216.0s)]
*  They were denied many times, weren't they? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=217.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=220.84s)]
*  And that's an untold story. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=221.84s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=223.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=224.44s)]
*  So they get within this range of the president, they didn't sweep the area, would also bother [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=225.44s)]
*  me, like when my kids would get in trouble when they were young. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't really get in trouble for what they did necessarily, but if they didn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=236.68s)]
*  tell me the truth, then they get a lot more trouble because I've always wanted them to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  be honest with me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=244.62s)]
*  And they told us in Butler, oh, we didn't have an agent on the roof because it was a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=246.94s)]
*  sloped roof. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=253.46s)]
*  That was not a sloped roof. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=255.22s)]
*  And then the current interim head of the Secret Service said the plan worked in West Palm [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=257.34s)]
*  Beach. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=264.3s)]
*  If somebody gets within 300 yards within AK-47 and a scope of your husband an assassin, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=266.24s)]
*  the plan didn't work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  No, it doesn't work that way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=276.24s)]
*  It needs to be much more secure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=279.48s)]
*  And I felt that about July 13 event, everything went quiet. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=282.8s)]
*  And I had a lot of questions. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=290.56s)]
*  That's why I put in to the social media my video. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=293.18s)]
*  Also it's explained in my book, a chapter about it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  And also the September 15 in Palm Beach, it was very shocking that that could happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=304.06s)]
*  And as I said, something is coming from the top, from the leadership. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's kind of, I watched the hearing, testimonies, and it kind of surprised me that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  one of the former Secret Service would say that he suggests that our family gets a private [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=333.88s)]
*  security plus Secret Service. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  And I'm thinking like, wow, this is really what he has in mind. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  He's like, you start questioning it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=352.17999999999995s)]
*  Because I know that the people who are around us, they are fantastic. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=354.85999999999996s)]
*  But for the top leadership, you have a question mark. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=359.46s)]
*  And that's all on this administration, that they could give permissions what to do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvahM2Np7WM&t=364.82s)]
