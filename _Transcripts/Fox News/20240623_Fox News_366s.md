# Hannity: 'Bombshell' report reveals Biden aides are worried
**Fox News:** [June 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw)
*  Now to a bombshell new report from Axios. Apparently senior Democrats, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's White House aides, are very worried about Joe's reelection strategy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=5.88s)]
*  centered around the January 6th riot. But they're quote worried about raising [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  concerns and meetings because Biden's group of longtime loyal aides can exile [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=16.26s)]
*  dissenters. Here with more, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. Did they forget about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the 574 riots in the summer of 2020 that they were either, you know, silent about, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=26.56s)]
*  said nothing about, or that they said and lied to us and said were mostly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=34.32s)]
*  peaceful that, let's see, resulted in dozens of dead Americans, thousands of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=39.72s)]
*  injured cops hit with rocks and bricks and bottles and Molotov cocktails, and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=45.16s)]
*  billions of property damage, where the Vice President Kamala Harris, then a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  candidate at the time, actually tweeted out a bail fund after the Minnesota or [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=55.44s)]
*  Minneapolis police precinct was burned to the ground. Did they forget about those [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=60.12s)]
*  moments of insurrection by seemingly Democratic supporters that they didn't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=64.52s)]
*  want to lose? Absolutely, Sean, they did. Bottom line is simply this, those summer [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=69.2s)]
*  riots were the most expensive riots in the history of America. Sean, the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=75.48s)]
*  Democrats, they're losing their minds because they're losing their voters, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=82.28s)]
*  their race based coalition, race baiting to keep the votes. It is crumbling [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=87.2s)]
*  before their very eyes. It's Donald Trump with the working class coalition [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  that's attracting more working class people, black, white, Hispanic, Asians, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=100.0s)]
*  because under Donald Trump, they have more money in their pockets. They're not [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=106.64s)]
*  talking about inflation. They're talking about we can't afford it. Same thing, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  better language. African Americans, Hispanics, white folks, Asians are coming [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=117.72000000000001s)]
*  together supporting Donald Trump because a closed, secured southern border means [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=123.2s)]
*  less migrant crime in poor neighborhoods. It means more open schools across our [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  nation. And frankly, the crime that's devastating inner cities under blue [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=136.88s)]
*  mayors goes away with Donald Trump. He will restore law and order. But 100%, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=144.08s)]
*  the summer riots to pandering, the pandering tour of Joe Biden, failure. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=152.4s)]
*  It's very encouraging. We need the polls. Four more years. Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=159.72s)]
*  Donald Trump. It's very encouraging the polls I see, especially with a big part [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=163.2s)]
*  of the Democratic coalition and their base, which is African Americans, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=169.24s)]
*  Hispanic Americans, young people. However, I don't like to be Pollyannish. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=172.68s)]
*  Or do Republicans need to look at independence? Maybe those that might have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=180.92s)]
*  been swayed by the sham trial in New York that don't know the details of what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=186.48s)]
*  really happened in that case. Do they have to be worried about older people [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=191.76s)]
*  that might have been swayed by the fake news, you know, industrial complex, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=198.0s)]
*  which pretty much is the rest of the media, but for Fox News, the New York [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=202.92s)]
*  Post and Wall Street Journal? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=207.32s)]
*  Yes, there's no doubt. One of the things we're seeing with this new working [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=211.2s)]
*  class coalition is it targets independent voters as much as it does any [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  other group. However, jobs is important, but the justice system, it reeks under [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=219.44s)]
*  Joe Biden. It's one of the reasons why we've seen a coalition of new voters [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=227.04s)]
*  looking at Donald Trump. Bottom line is simply this. When the judge is making [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=232.64s)]
*  contributions to Joe Biden, when his daughter is raising hundreds, not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=238.0s)]
*  millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for Democrat candidates, you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=243.84s)]
*  can't get a fair trial. When Alvin Bragg runs for office with one objective to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=248.96s)]
*  put Donald Trump in jail, you can't get a fair trial. The bottom line is simply [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=255.84s)]
*  this. In order for us to clean out the Justice Department, fire Merrick [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=262.36s)]
*  Garland and restore confidence in Lady Justice and her blindfold, we've got to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=268.04s)]
*  fire Joe Biden and elect Donald Trump. Independent voters want, actually, they [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=274.48s)]
*  require a fair and just America. A two tiered justice system won't get that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  done. Weaponizing DOJ against your political opponents won't get that done, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=288.76s)]
*  Sean. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=294.68s)]
*  And by the way, I don't think you should have gotten a report like the her [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  report that said, well, yeah, he did all these things when it comes to top secret [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=301.0s)]
*  classified documents, but any jury would probably see him as a nice old man [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=305.44s)]
*  that's very forgetful. That's not exactly equal justice the way they [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=310.2s)]
*  treated Donald Trump. And Joe may want to pay close attention because unlike the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=315.4s)]
*  things they made up about Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=321.44s)]
*  implicates his own father as benefiting financially from his foreign business [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=327.12s)]
*  deals and exposes the lie that he never talked to his son, his brother or [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=333.32s)]
*  anybody about those deals. I'd worry about that if I was Joe Biden, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  especially if he's not president in January of 25. Senator, great to have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=344.0s)]
*  you. Thank you. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. God bless. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtR2aJDjWw&t=351.84s)]
