# Tim Walz is Gavin Newsom ‘on steroids': Ron DeSantis
**Fox News:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI)
*  Joining us now, Florida Governor, well the free state of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Governor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=0.0s)]
*  I almost feel like clicking my heels and saying over and over again, there's no place like home, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  there's no place like home. I miss the home state of Florida, but somebody's got to be here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=11.52s)]
*  And anyway, great to have you. How are you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=20.88s)]
*  I'm doing good, Sean. I'll tell you, I can count very high the number of people that have fled [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=22.64s)]
*  Chicago over the last five years to move down to Florida. And I have not met one person that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=31.12s)]
*  regrets that move given how that city is run. Yeah, but this is happening from all over the country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=36.96s)]
*  Last time you are, and you even mentioned a lot of people from Minnesota, similarly have left that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=43.2s)]
*  state. I didn't realize that Minnesota was one of the states that had the highest [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=48.32s)]
*  level of people exiting, many for our state of Florida, where you're our governor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  And the numbers vary. I think they were the fourth largest behind California, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=62.32s)]
*  New York, and maybe New Jersey, or maybe Illinois. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=66.72s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, remember when we did on your show the Gavin Newsom debate, and that was kind [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=72.08s)]
*  of like the polar opposites. You have the free state of Florida, conservative principles versus [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=76.4s)]
*  left of the left and all the problems in California. And people said that's like the perfect [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=82.0s)]
*  contrast. But I'll tell you, Sean, Waltz is really new some on steroids. He very quietly enacted [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  one of the most left-wing agendas in American history. I had a lot of people from Minnesota [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=95.12s)]
*  move down. They were very, very upset at his policies, both his draconian COVID policies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  Sean, this is a guy whose main line in his stump speech now is that people should leave their [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=106.16s)]
*  neighbors alone and mind their own damn business. During COVID, he instituted lockdown measures and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=111.36s)]
*  set up a snitch line so that neighbors could call the government and snitch on their neighbors. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=117.28s)]
*  So he's a fabulous, he's a very left-wing politician. I think it was a horrible selection [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  by Kamala Harris. But I think in some respects it's fitting for the campaign, because [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=129.84s)]
*  what I'm witnessing at that convention, what I've been seeing in the last month in the media, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=135.28s)]
*  this is the biggest gaslighting attempt in the history of American politics. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=140.16s)]
*  They are taking a vice president of the United States, who they are claiming is this fresh new [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=145.04s)]
*  voice that's going to solve all the nation's problems that she had such an important hand [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=150.8s)]
*  in creating in the first place. She cast the tie-breaking vote for Biden's 1.9 trillion [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=156.56s)]
*  stimulus that fueled inflation. She was the border czar that saw record numbers of people [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=162.64s)]
*  coming in. So it is, I think, an IQ test for the public. Are you really going to buy this? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Because it ain't credible. Yeah, you know, the campaign, as soon as we get down to issues, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=175.04s)]
*  is where I think their campaign begins to fall apart. I mean, this is all choreographed Hollywood [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=180.0s)]
*  smoke and mirrors. There's nothing real about it. You get some great entertainment, love Stevie [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=185.04s)]
*  Wonder, that's fine, but that's not going to solve the country's problems. You get to the issue of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=189.6s)]
*  their open borders policy. They want to decriminalize illegal immigration. They want free healthcare, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  housing, education. They want to defund dismantle, no bail laws. They want to defund ICE, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=200.72s)]
*  no fracking, no drilling. You add all of it together, I mean, in a foreign policy that, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=207.2s)]
*  frankly, is chilling. Do you know that, you mentioned earlier about Tim Walz and his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=213.04s)]
*  background and how he handled COVID. I interviewed a grandmother of 17, soon to be 18. Do you know [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=219.76s)]
*  that he put this woman in jail? She owned a little coffee and wine bistro, and she decided to open a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  door, and people decided to patronize her place of business freely. They talk about a lot of freedom [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=235.04s)]
*  here, and they put this woman on trial, convicted her, and put her in jail. A grandmother of 17, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=241.6s)]
*  17 grandchildren they put in jail for 60 days. I'm not surprised at all because I know that there [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=251.68s)]
*  were people that fled Minnesota precisely because of those types of policies. We also had a lot of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=258.56s)]
*  families move from Minnesota to Florida because he locked down the schools for so long. And you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=263.44s)]
*  he was asked about that recently in some interview about, hey, there was learning laws. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=268.48s)]
*  There's all the, don't you regret locking down the schools. We know that was a mistake. And he said, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=273.92s)]
*  oh, these kids learned resiliency. So he is unrepentant about what he did that was so damaging. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=279.04s)]
*  And he plays this schtick. The media goes along, but man, this guy is a hardcore leftist. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=286.32s)]
*  He really is. When you listen to what you're hearing here and knowing what the real record [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=293.76s)]
*  is, that now the challenge is the media is not doing their job. This is the equivalent of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=299.44s)]
*  Joe hiding in the basement in 2020. It seems that the challenge for the Trump campaign now is to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=305.44s)]
*  bypass the media and make sure the American people, before they go to vote, early voting begins in 28 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=312.24s)]
*  days, that they are fully aware of the radical positions of both Kamala and Tim Walz. How do [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  they do that? Well, part of it is by, you know, speaking the truth in these, in these swing states. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=323.36s)]
*  I know there's a massive advertising campaign going on. I think that's important, but I also [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  think, Sean, it's the positions on the issue combined with the fact that Kamala Harris is a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=335.68s)]
*  vapid politician. She's basically vice president word salad. So I'm looking forward to that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=342.8s)]
*  September 10th debate with Donald Trump and Kamala. Donald Trump can stand on the stage for 90 [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=349.28s)]
*  minutes. I don't think she can do it, Sean. I think that's a great opportunity for Donald Trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  to show she is not fit to be president of the United States. I gotta have to leave it here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=360.4s)]
*  Governor, I look forward to being back with you in my home state of Florida, the free state of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  Florida. We appreciate you being with us. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFR01rYhmoI&t=371.11999999999995s)]
