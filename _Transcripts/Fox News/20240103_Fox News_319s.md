# Legal experts break down Jeffrey Epstein court documents
**Fox News:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0)
*  Joining us now, former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, and criminal defense attorney Mark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=0.0s)]
*  Garagos. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good to have you both. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Pam, let's get your take on this release. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  What does it mean to you? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=8.4s)]
*  Well, it's trickled out, Sean. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=10.4s)]
*  It's trickling out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=13.52s)]
*  First of all, it should have come out a long time ago. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=14.52s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz wanted it out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=16.84s)]
*  By the way, he is one of the best attorneys in this country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=18.64s)]
*  I know him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=21.64s)]
*  I know his wife. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=22.64s)]
*  That's a great family, and they've been dragged through hell on this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=24.18s)]
*  I want to know why A.G. Garland and the Justice Department are so quiet on this tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=27.479999999999997s)]
*  You know, they're out there labeling parents domestic terrorists, yet they're saying [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=32.8s)]
*  nothing about this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  And these documents were so slow to come out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Human trafficking is a multibillion dollar business in this country, and Jeffrey Epstein [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=42.68s)]
*  is dead, and Gerlaine Maxwell is in prison for 20 years, where she belongs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=47.56s)]
*  And if people in that report are still fighting to keep their names private, Sean, they have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=53.56s)]
*  no legal basis to do so unless they're a child, a victim, or a cooperating defendant by some [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  chance against some potential case against Gerlaine Maxwell. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=65.72s)]
*  And I think Mark Garagos, as a great criminal defense attorney, will back that up as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, Mark, let me go to you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of people that Professor Dershowitz has represented that, frankly, I never liked [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=76.44s)]
*  and really don't understand why he would take on these high profile cases. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  You're just like Professor Dershowitz. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=89.04s)]
*  You've taken on a lot of high profile cases. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=91.04s)]
*  And I know you've paid a pretty dear price for representing people with the belief that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=94.28s)]
*  everybody has a right to a defense. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=98.44s)]
*  And you paid a price for that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  What is your take on tonight? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, my father, who was my hero and was a former prosecutor, I remember going to him [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  over 20 years ago when I was asked to represent Scott Peterson. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=111.76s)]
*  And, you know, it was one of those things where he was the most hated man in the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  And he said, if you're not going to take this case because you're worried about your reputation, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=119.92s)]
*  then why do you do what you do? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=123.72000000000001s)]
*  Which I kind of live by. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  And I think I've talked with Alan over the years, and we've represented many of the same [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  people and talked about kind of the thankless job that it is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=131.52s)]
*  It's been rewarding for both of us intellectually and financially. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=135.4s)]
*  But at the same time, you've got to suffer the slings and arrows. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=139.28s)]
*  And I will tell you that it's easy to make accusations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a lot tougher when you're, Alan, trying to defend yourself against the allegations [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=146.36s)]
*  and watching him and the pain he's gone through for the last couple of years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  And I've talked to him more than one occasion about the toll that it's taken on him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  I kind of chuckled to myself when he was talking about losing all the friends because he represented [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=161.96s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of the things, the most hateful comments I've ever gotten is when I represented Republican [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  political fundraisers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=175.56s)]
*  So I feel his pain and probably not to the level exponentially that he has because of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's a function of this system. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in an adversarial system, then you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=188.6s)]
*  need somebody to do it, not just walk through the motions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=194.27999999999997s)]
*  I've never met a client yet who came to my office and said, I just want somebody to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  window dressing and sit by here and not really put up a defense. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=204.52s)]
*  You want somebody who's going to fight for you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=208.84s)]
*  And I've had countless clients that have been innocent and we've proven it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=210.88s)]
*  What about Bill Clinton? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=216.08s)]
*  How does he factor into this when we know he's a liar? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=217.08s)]
*  We know the issue of Monica Lewinsky. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=220.44s)]
*  I've got to believe that a lot of Americans suspect there might be some truth to this, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=222.68s)]
*  especially with the number of times he was on the plane, which I believe contradicted [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=226.36s)]
*  his public statement, if I recall correctly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=230.28s)]
*  Pam. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=232.28s)]
*  Well, Sean, you and I go so far back. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=233.28s)]
*  We know one of the witnesses. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=236.28s)]
*  We used to have fights about this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=237.28s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=238.28s)]
*  Pam first, Pam. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=239.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=240.28s)]
*  And well, we know he was on the plane, not only on the plane a couple of times, multiple [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=241.28s)]
*  times he traveled internationally, internationally with Jeffrey Epstein, and he was on the plane [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=247.56s)]
*  called the Lolita Express because it supposedly had a bed in there where Jeffrey Epstein had [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=253.96s)]
*  young girls. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=260.52s)]
*  He has been a friend of his, a continuing friend of his for years and years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=262.66s)]
*  Contrast that with Donald Trump, who hasn't spoken to him in many years, over a decade [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=267.08s)]
*  after he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago for bad behavior. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=272.24s)]
*  So that's the difference there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=276.04s)]
*  And I think Americans see the two-tier justice system. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=277.36s)]
*  But you know, we don't know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=281.28s)]
*  They're saying Clinton has not been to his private island, but he has traveled all over [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=282.68s)]
*  the world with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=286.24s)]
*  Well, over time, let's see. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=289.28s)]
*  And if the judge does have other information that would add context and texture to a list, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=292.84s)]
*  I do believe the judge has an obligation to release it, especially because people's names [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=298.5s)]
*  or reputation are in play here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=302.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=304.68s)]
*  Pam, thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=305.68s)]
*  Mark Ergost, thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=306.68s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=307.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9dfF_q7F0&t=308.68s)]
