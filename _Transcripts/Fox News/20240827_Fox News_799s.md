# Sean Hannity: This is pathetic
**Fox News:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc)
*  But let's be very clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=0.0s)]
*  The federal government is totally out of control, and freedoms that you thought you had are [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=1.52s)]
*  non-existent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=6.8s)]
*  And with 69 days until Election Day, 21 days until early voting begins in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=8.24s)]
*  mail-in ballots going out even sooner than that, in the next week or two, many Americans [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=13.76s)]
*  are asking themselves, who is in charge of this country and how corrupt are big institutions [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=18.62s)]
*  in America? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=25.32s)]
*  Like Big Tech? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=26.32s)]
*  Like the media, state-run media mob? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=27.6s)]
*  Like our government? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=29.72s)]
*  Joe Biden is on his second consecutive beach week vacation, nothing on his calendar. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=30.96s)]
*  He's been mentally checked out for quite some time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=36.84s)]
*  Well, that would mean Vice President Harris, is she in charge? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=39.4s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=42.56s)]
*  Because she doesn't seem to know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=44.2s)]
*  She's been traveling around the country for weeks on end, pretending to be a challenger, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  all while vowing to fix the problems that she caused with Joe on day one. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=50.36s)]
*  Day one, Kamala was January 20th, 2021, not 2025. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And now she's not giving many details at all. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=63.6s)]
*  They don't have time for any more details. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=66.68s)]
*  They're very stressed out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=69.4s)]
*  Now, there are no policy positions that are listed on her website. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=70.64s)]
*  She has participated in zero press conferences, zero town halls, zero interviews. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=74.74s)]
*  But this coming Thursday, we got the big announcement after seven-plus weeks, Kamala will finally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  sit down for her very first TV interview. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=85.04s)]
*  Take a look at the conditions, though. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=87.68s)]
*  This is going to be a prerecorded interview on fake news CNN, of course. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=90.0s)]
*  Why didn't they just do Rachel Maddow, the conspiracy theorist and liar on MSDNC? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=95.0s)]
*  And she's doing it with far-left Trump hater Dana Bash. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=100.04s)]
*  Let's see if she can keep her fairness record going for two interviews in a row. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=103.44s)]
*  Anyway, Vice President Walz will be present. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  He's there to offer moral support and bail Kamala out if she gets lost in one of her [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=110.2s)]
*  now famous never-ending platitudes about the passage of time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Time is passing, and we're all passing through time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=120.48s)]
*  If Kamala can't handle a single live interview by herself with a friendly CNN host, how's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  she going to handle President Xi, Vladimir Putin, or the mullahs in Iran, or any other [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  adversarial world leader? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=136.64s)]
*  And Dana, let me give you all of your research right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=137.64s)]
*  It's all on Hannity.com. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=141.04s)]
*  They're called the Kamala files, the Walz files. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=143.16s)]
*  This is Kamala and Walz in their own words. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  You don't have to do the research. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=149.48s)]
*  We did it all for you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=150.6s)]
*  And you can fact check, it's not AI-generated. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Does she still want to ban fracking and drilling? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=154.32s)]
*  Is she still bragging about Bidenomics? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Does she still think inflation is transitory? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=158.76s)]
*  Does she still want to decriminalize illegal immigration and offer free housing, health [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=161.56s)]
*  care and education to illegals and make American taxpayers pay for it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=166.24s)]
*  And what does she say to the families of victims of Harris-Biden unvetted illegals, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=171.04s)]
*  those that were murdered and raped and victims of other horrendous crimes in this country? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=176.44s)]
*  Does she still support amnesty for illegals? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Does she still refer to ICE as the KKK, want to defund them and defund and dismantle the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=184.72s)]
*  police and reimagine them and implement no bail laws? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=190.16s)]
*  How about it? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=194.4s)]
*  What about her support for the rioters in the summer of 2020? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=195.44s)]
*  You know, the summer of love. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=198.6s)]
*  Five hundred and seventy four riots and insurrections at once. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=200.24s)]
*  Is she glad that she said they're not going to stop and they shouldn't stop and tweeting [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=203.8s)]
*  out that bail fund? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=208.32s)]
*  And what about Timmy, her running mate? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=209.88s)]
*  He still want tampons and boys bathrooms. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=212.68s)]
*  Does he still want to eliminate all parental rights and offer gender affirming care for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=215.36s)]
*  kids without adults permission and legal drivers licenses and free college for illegals? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=221.0s)]
*  These are important questions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=226.44s)]
*  And so far, she will only commit to a single debate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=227.64s)]
*  She tried hard to get out of it, even on left wing ABC after Donald Trump had already agreed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=230.88s)]
*  to all the rules they themselves demanded. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=236.6s)]
*  They demanded they requested them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=239.48s)]
*  And recently, Kamala tried to change the rules at the last minute, requesting that the mics [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=241.76s)]
*  remain hot throughout the debate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=246.88s)]
*  She wanted to manufacture another I'm speaking, I'm speaking. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=249.48s)]
*  Do you know I'm speaking, which kind of went viral if, God forbid, Donald Trump ever [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=253.44s)]
*  interrupted her during a debate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=258.88s)]
*  But today on Truth Social, Donald Trump has agreed to the debate with the same rules that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=261.48s)]
*  they originally agreed to. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=266.88s)]
*  Jason Miller from the Trump campaign said the Harris campaign wanted to have a seated [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=268.08s)]
*  debate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=272.48s)]
*  She wanted cheat sheets. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=273.48s)]
*  She wanted notes in front of her and hot mics the whole time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=275.36s)]
*  The opposite of everything she agreed to. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Now keep in mind, ABC News is openly hostile to former President Donald Trump and most [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=281.52s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=286.48s)]
*  For example, you might recall here is ABC News reporter Rachel Scott with the very first [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=287.48s)]
*  question during Donald Trump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=293.36s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=298.6s)]
*  Ask yourself, does it sound like journalism or a talk show host? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=299.8s)]
*  I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room, sir. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=305.12s)]
*  A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=308.88s)]
*  You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals from Nikki Haley to former President [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=313.64s)]
*  Barack Obama saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  You have told four Congresswoman women of color who were American citizens to go back [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=323.44s)]
*  to where they came from. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=327.32s)]
*  You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  You've attacked black journalists calling them a loser saying the questions that they [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=334.28s)]
*  ask are, quote, stupid and racist. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=337.96s)]
*  You've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=340.84s)]
*  So my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, why should [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=344.4s)]
*  black voters trust you after you have used language like that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question so in such a horrible [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=354.32s)]
*  manner the first question. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=361.2s)]
*  Trump wins the crowd over. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=365.28s)]
*  Anyway, it gets worse. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=366.84s)]
*  One of ABC News' top so-called journalists, a former Clinton hack. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=368.36s)]
*  We'll be talking a lot about him in the days to come. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=372.28s)]
*  His name is Georgi Stephanopoulos. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=374.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=377.0s)]
*  We better be ready for the fact that he might be leading the Republican ticket. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=378.0s)]
*  Next week. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=381.44s)]
*  I know you don't believe that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=382.44s)]
*  The course of Trump's presidency will turn on his coming public showdown with James Comey. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  The big question, did President Trump try to block the FBI's Russia investigation, commit [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=388.9s)]
*  an impeachable offense? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=393.58s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=395.32s)]
*  Had a good week. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=396.36s)]
*  It was another one of those wild ones at the White House. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=397.36s)]
*  How strange is it for you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=399.48s)]
*  You write that President Trump is unethical, untethered to the truth. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=404.54s)]
*  Is Donald Trump unfit to be president? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=409.2s)]
*  It's all too easy to fall into reflexive habits, to treat this as a normal campaign where both [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=412.02s)]
*  sides embrace the rule of law, where both sides are dedicated to a debate based on facts [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=418.02s)]
*  and the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=422.8s)]
*  But that is not what's happening this election year. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  As you point out those statements from J.D. Vance and Vivek Ramaswamy, of course, President [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=427.56s)]
*  Trump and his supporters have contributed to this violent rhetoric as well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=432.12s)]
*  Well, he claims to be a journalist. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=436.36s)]
*  He's not. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  He is a liberal talk show host and a hack of one as well. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, ABC is a cheerleader for the Harris campaign, and yet Kamala Harris is still scared [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=444.6s)]
*  to debate Donald Trump. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=449.64s)]
*  Trying to get her hardest to get out the last couple of days. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=451.0s)]
*  It is not just her trouble speaking without a teleprompter and constant nervous, bizarre [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=454.04s)]
*  giggling. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  Kamala Harris appears to be in the midst of an identity crisis and has become in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=460.8s)]
*  Democratic nominee. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=464.44s)]
*  Almost all of her radical positions that she held so near and dear, you know, have seemingly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=466.0s)]
*  changed or at least that's what anonymous aides say behind closed doors. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't know because she won't give a press conference or talk to anybody. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=475.56s)]
*  For example, in 2019, she called Trump's border wall a medieval vanity project and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=478.8s)]
*  even mocked the possibility of terrorists coming across our southern border. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=484.08s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, as you see this, as the 11 million plus unvetted Harris Biden illegal [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=488.2s)]
*  immigrants have come into the country, so have hundreds with terror ties. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=493.16s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=498.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=499.68s)]
*  This is a crisis of the president's own making. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=501.12s)]
*  To fulfill his quest to build a vanity project called the wall. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=504.36s)]
*  This is irresponsible. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=512.98s)]
*  It's a height of irresponsibility. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=515.0s)]
*  For the commander in chief to suggest that we have to build a wall across our southern [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=517.4s)]
*  border because there are terrorists who are trying to invade the country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=523.8s)]
*  It couldn't be farther from the truth. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=530.32s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=537.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, the height of irresponsibility is letting people in from 180 countries, unvetted, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=542.44s)]
*  including Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, Russia, China and Venezuela, including people [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=548.24s)]
*  with known terror ties. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=554.7600000000001s)]
*  And we have no idea where they are. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  People would terror ties. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=558.52s)]
*  That is the height of irresponsibility. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=560.8s)]
*  As the vice president and border czar, Kamala halted construction on the border wall, leaving [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=563.32s)]
*  huge gaps at our southern border. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=568.6s)]
*  They told us for three years, the border is closed and secure. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=570.8s)]
*  It's not never has been all of a sudden. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=573.92s)]
*  Well, the campaign aides say Kamala now wants to build the wall, a vanity wall, I guess. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=576.52s)]
*  And she even features Trump's border wall at her campaign ads, as we showed you last [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=582.22s)]
*  night. And that's not all. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=586.5999999999999s)]
*  Remember when she wanted to eliminate immigration, in other words, and customs enforcement, better [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=588.04s)]
*  known as ICE, that she also compared to the KKK? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=592.88s)]
*  You might recall. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=596.16s)]
*  A lot of the signs at the rally you just held were people standing there saying, abolish [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=597.16s)]
*  ICE. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  Is that a position that you agree with? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=606.16s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=611.4799999999999s)]
*  And we need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=614.4s)]
*  wrong with the way that it's conducting itself. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=619.88s)]
*  And we need to deal with that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=622.0s)]
*  Anonymous aides say she no longer believes that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not just the border. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=627.52s)]
*  It's not just ICE. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=628.52s)]
*  During her first presidential campaign, Kamala also promised to eliminate private insurance. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=629.52s)]
*  Remember, Medicare for all. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=635.0s)]
*  Government will take care of your health care. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=636.48s)]
*  How's the post office working for you? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=638.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=640.48s)]
*  You support the Medicare for all bill. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  I think initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=643.72s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=646.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=647.24s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=648.24s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=651.88s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=655.6s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=660.4s)]
*  them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=668.56s)]
*  says well? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=672.4s)]
*  I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=674.16s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  Forget your—the Freedom and Joy Party wants to take away, let's see, your money to pay [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  for college health care housing for illegals. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=684.92s)]
*  They want to take away your money and your ability and choice to have your own health [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=687.8s)]
*  care plan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=692.52s)]
*  They want to pay for a $93 trillion New Green Deal that she co-sponsored in the Senate, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=693.88s)]
*  you know, and now she's saying she completely changed her mind. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=698.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=701.64s)]
*  Just for the sake of the campaign, I'll let you keep your private health insurance. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=702.64s)]
*  We hear the same message about the New Green Deal. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=705.72s)]
*  She introduced both these bills in the Senate that she co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=708.66s)]
*  and her plan to ban fracking and offshore drilling. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=713.56s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=716.56s)]
*  It's a campaign year. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=717.56s)]
*  I can't run on what I really believe. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=718.56s)]
*  And her promise to reimagine public safety with fewer police and defund and dismantle [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  no bail laws. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=725.68s)]
*  The list of wild, flipping, flopping, flailing goes on and on, but we don't really know [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=727.48s)]
*  where Kamala stands. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=732.6s)]
*  Kamala won't say what she believes. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=733.6s)]
*  We, you know, have her on tape saying all of these things. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=736.0s)]
*  You just get whispers, she might have changed her mind. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=739.08s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=741.8s)]
*  And that is a bad sign. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=742.8s)]
*  It means her true beliefs are too radical for the general population and her campaign [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=743.8s)]
*  knows it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=748.54s)]
*  And if the American people know it—that's why I created the Kamala files, the Wall files—you [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=749.54s)]
*  can take it for free. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=754.16s)]
*  It's on Hannity.com. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=755.36s)]
*  Send it to your friends, family. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=756.8s)]
*  Put it out on social media, because the mob, state-run media, they're not going to run [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=758.2s)]
*  it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=762.48s)]
*  Michael Moore seems to agree. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=763.48s)]
*  He wrote, Kamala will be the most progressive president in history. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=764.48s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=768.08s)]
*  He's about as far left as you can get. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=769.08s)]
*  And tonight he's, quote, so hopeful. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=771.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, they're not moderates by any stretch. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=773.84s)]
*  What they're selling is snake oil. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=777.88s)]
*  They are lying. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=779.76s)]
*  And if they win in November, our country is in deep trouble. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=780.8s)]
*  Capitalism as we know it, that'll go away. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOKibKzzBc&t=784.48s)]
