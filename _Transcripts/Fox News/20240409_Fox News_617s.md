# Sean Hannity: Journalists are far-left hacks
**Fox News:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w)
*  And welcome to Hannity with just 209 days until the 2024 presidential election. Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=0.0s)]
*  now are facing a mountain of serious, serious problems. Now, each night on this program, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=8.34s)]
*  we do our very best to document the truth, many of the major issues of the day that impact [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=14.58s)]
*  your life, including Joe Biden's border crisis, his crime crisis, the Biden inflation crisis, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=19.88s)]
*  the turmoil that is overseas and around the world. And tonight we will show you the latest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=26.64s)]
*  record-breaking crime statistics, the latest big crime carjackings. We'll also bring in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=32.04s)]
*  the latest example of violent crime. It is now exploding among New York City's massive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=37.88s)]
*  illegal immigrant population. Also tonight, Larry Kudlow will be here with an update on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=43.92s)]
*  the economy. Spoiler alert, I wish I had better news. The numbers are not good. Needless to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=48.44s)]
*  say, the coverage is not the same on other networks or on the pages of almost any major [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=54.92s)]
*  newspaper. Now, these are organizations filled with self-proclaimed journalists. They're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=60.92s)]
*  not journalists. One big problem, journalism is dead. It is buried. This is something that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=67.68s)]
*  I, well, accurately said back in 2007 or eight when the press turned into giddy cheerleaders [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  for the anointed one, Barack Obama. Now, for almost every newsroom in America, it's not, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=81.72s)]
*  they're not news. They're opinion, they're talk show hosts, they're radical leftist [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=87.28s)]
*  talk hosts. With a few exceptions, journalism has now been replaced by liberal radical activism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=90.84s)]
*  Journalists are far-left hacks, some of them flirting right on the borderline with communism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  There is no fidelity to the truth whatsoever. They will lie, they will censor, they will [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  obfuscate the truth, all as a means to an end. Their goal is political power, a left-wing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=109.04s)]
*  utopia where dissent no longer exists. But you don't have to take my word for it. One [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  senior editor at NPR, courageously now just coming clean in an op-ed entitled, quote, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=121.72s)]
*  I've been at NPR for 25 years. Here's how we lost America's, America's trust. He then [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=127.64000000000001s)]
*  went on to blast his own organization for morphing from a left-leaning news operation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=135.2s)]
*  into an extreme far-left political machine focused on, quote, efforts to damage or topple [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's presidency. He found that the taxpayer-funded national radio station employed, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=148.64s)]
*  quote, 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions. How many Republicans? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  Zero. He was critical of NPR's obsession over the Russia hoax and its decision to censor [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=162.24s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop story. Quote, the laptop was newsworthy, but the timeless journalistic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=168.84s)]
*  instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched during a meeting with colleagues. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  I listened, I listened as one of NPR's best and most fair-minded journalists said it was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=181.56s)]
*  good we weren't following the laptop story. Why? Because it could help Donald Trump. Even [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=188.56s)]
*  for a self-described Subaru driving, Sara Lawrence educated 25-year NPR employee, even [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=194.52s)]
*  that went too far. Now, of course, to no one else at NPR, they don't seem to care. Their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=201.96s)]
*  operation pretty much mirrors almost every other, quote, newsroom in America. They're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=207.8s)]
*  not newsrooms. For them, Biden is little more than a spineless, brainless vessel who can [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=212.6s)]
*  be used to implement their radical vision for America. They might even actually see [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=218.96s)]
*  Joe Biden's intellectual shortcomings and his cognitive decline as a positive thing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  because it then makes it easier to control him. In contrast, they hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=229.72s)]
*  They're not shy about it. They hate the MAGA movement. And more than anything else, they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=235.72s)]
*  have zero influence over Donald Trump. He deeply offends their virtuous sensibilities. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=240.36s)]
*  He represents a real threat to America's bloated partisan bureaucracy known as the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=247.24s)]
*  deep state. He shatters illusions. He's iconoclastic in that way. So no matter how spectacularly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden is failing as president, he's going to get a free pass and extremely favorable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=260.76s)]
*  coverage all while Donald Trump gets dragged through the mud. And here is but the latest [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=266.44s)]
*  example. Take a look. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=271.52s)]
*  What in your view constitutes the primary threat to freedom and democracy at home? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=273.32s)]
*  Donald Trump. Seriously. Donald Trump uses phrases like, you're going to eviscerate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=278.4s)]
*  the Constitution and he's going to be a dictator on day one. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=285.64s)]
*  Joe Biden is lying. Donald Trump did not say any of those things. Trump also didn't direct [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=290.04s)]
*  his Department of Justice to persecute, prosecute his political opponents. That was Joe Biden, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=296.0s)]
*  the president of this country. Joe Biden is now using America's system of justice as a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=303.0s)]
*  political weapon. The president is now also likely defying a Supreme Court ruling on, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=308.44s)]
*  quote, student loan forgiveness just prior to an election. Why? He wants to buy votes [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=314.16s)]
*  before the courts have yet another chance to step in and stop him for a second time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=319.8s)]
*  Now, the president also reportedly directed the federal government with the help of big [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=325.8s)]
*  tech to censor social media posts they don't like. The president also eliminated our southern [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=330.18s)]
*  border. He's not enforcing the laws of this country and he's aided and abetted in the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=336.76s)]
*  law breaking, encouraging what over 10 million unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants into [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=341.6s)]
*  the country, many of whom are breaking our laws, many from our top geopolitical foes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=347.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is the threat to democracy? No, I would say the threat at the border with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=353.28s)]
*  people from Iran and Syria, Afghanistan and Egypt and Russia and China, they're probably [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=357.88s)]
*  a bigger threat to our democracy. Notice that the biased reporter didn't bring up any of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  these issues during Joe's answer. Just sat there in silence, happily providing Joe Biden [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  with a platform to smear Trump. In fact, outside of this network, few of America's abusively [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=376.08s)]
*  biased and corrupt reporters ever challenged Joe Biden or call him out for his blatant [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=382.78s)]
*  lies to let him spend the entire 2020 election hiding in his basement. And for example, yesterday [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=389.34s)]
*  we got another big whopper. Take a look. I like an awful lot of people in this audience. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=395.76s)]
*  I was the first in my family to go to college and watch my dad struggle to help me get there [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=401.46s)]
*  and get all the kids there. And it wasn't easy. Joe Biden was not the first one in his [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=408.17999999999995s)]
*  family to go to college. His father attended the very prestigious John Hopkins University. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=414.06s)]
*  And Biden is even on tape bragging about his grandfather who played football at Santa Clara. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=420.28s)]
*  Take a look. Being raised by a grandpop who went to Santa Clara back in the days when [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=426.41999999999996s)]
*  Irish in northeast Pennsylvania didn't very much get a chance to go to college. He was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=432.8s)]
*  an all American football player at Santa Clara and he came back as a newspaper guy on the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=437.56s)]
*  business side. In 1987, the New York Times, they brutalized Biden over this very same [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=442.0s)]
*  lie but don't expect a similar level of journalism today. The fact checkers have taken a sabbatical [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=448.66s)]
*  for the last three years as Biden lies pretty much with impunity. He lied about leaving [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  Americans behind in Afghanistan. He lied about his own son dying in Iraq. He didn't die in Iraq. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=460.56s)]
*  He lied about his never meeting with his son or brother or anybody for that matter, their foreign [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=466.22s)]
*  business deals or ever had any discussions with any of them. He lied about his role in the civil [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=473.52s)]
*  rights movement. He lied about getting arrested in South Africa. He lied about his involvement [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=478.44s)]
*  with Hunter's art career. He lied about the border being closed and the border being secure. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=483.36s)]
*  He lied about inflation being transitory. He lied about his interview with the special counsel, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  Robert Herr. He lied about Trump's position on abortion. He currently lies about the national [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=494.84s)]
*  debt and deficit going down and he lied when he promised to support Israel, which is America's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=500.32s)]
*  closest closest ally in the Middle East. No, in order to win back the radical left wing voters [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=505.96s)]
*  that have been running from him, Biden has turned his back on Israel as literally putting his own [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=512.44s)]
*  blind personal political ambition above standing up against radical Islamic terrorists that attacked [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=519.08s)]
*  Israel, killing many and taking others prisoner. You know, Joe is now desperately trying to appease, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  well, people like this. He wants their vote. Take a look. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=533.0s)]
*  The Gaza has shown the entire world why these protests are so anti-America because it's the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=536.64s)]
*  United States government that provides the funds for all of the atrocities that we just heard about. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=544.04s)]
*  That video chance of death to America, death to Israel coming from Dearborn, Michigan, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  got very little coverage outside of this network. And it wasn't the first time that we have heard [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=563.7600000000001s)]
*  calls for Israel to be annihilated from this group. But the media mob doesn't want it to be an issue, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=568.8800000000001s)]
*  especially when Biden is begging for their support. They would never let the hatred for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  America get in the way of winning a good election and beating Donald Trump any way they can. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  So as always, the media mob, they will do whatever it's going to take to cover for Joe Biden. And yet [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=584.96s)]
*  they still claim to be journalists. They are not. They are radical left-wing talk show hosts [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=590.64s)]
*  pretending to be journalists. It is dishonest. It's insulting. And you, the American people, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=596.56s)]
*  most of you watching this network know better. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4CYo3n__w&t=602.72s)]
