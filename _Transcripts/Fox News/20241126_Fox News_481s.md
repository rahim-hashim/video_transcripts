# Homan sends stern message to liberal gov: 'I'm willing to put him in jail'
**Fox News:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M)
*  Here with reaction, the man that President Trump appointed to fix the border, Tom Homan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=0.0s)]
*  along with someone who, frankly, has played a very big role in bringing attention to this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  security disaster, Texas Governor Greg Abbott. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=10.94s)]
*  And they're going to be together all day tomorrow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=14.38s)]
*  Tom, you heard this mayor out there in Colorado. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=16.94s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=23.26s)]
*  And I want you to be clear about who has jurisdiction, the federal government or state and local [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  governments. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=29.22s)]
*  And if you're a sanctuary state or city, are you breaking the law? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=30.22s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely breaking the law. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=33.34s)]
*  All you have to do is look at Arizona versus US. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=36.78s)]
*  You'll see these breaking the law. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  But look, me and the Denver mayor, we agree on one thing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=40.06s)]
*  He's willing to go to jail. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=43.38s)]
*  I'm willing to put him in jail because there's a statute. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=44.94s)]
*  It's Title 8 United States Code 1324, a triple I. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=48.46s)]
*  And what it says is it's a felony if you knowingly harbor and conceal illegal alien from immigration [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=51.94s)]
*  authorities. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=57.46s)]
*  It's also a felony to impede a federal law enforcement officer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=58.54s)]
*  So if we don't want to help, that's fine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=61.14s)]
*  He can get the hell out of the way. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  But we're going to go do the job. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=64.1s)]
*  President Trump has a mandate of American people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=65.94s)]
*  We got to secure this country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=67.98s)]
*  We got to save American lives. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=69.26s)]
*  And I find it shocking that any mayor of a city would sayâ€”and President Trump's been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=70.94s)]
*  clear. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=74.82s)]
*  We want to concentrate on public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=75.82s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that any mayor or governor would say they don't want public [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=78.26s)]
*  safety threats removed from their neighborhoods. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=81.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the hell is going on in Denver, but we're going to go and we're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=83.66s)]
*  going to fix it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=86.9s)]
*  If we don't want to protect these communities, President Trump and ICE will. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=88.34s)]
*  So you will be going into Colorado, Illinois, New York, California, and you are going to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  uphold the law of the land. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=101.62s)]
*  That's your commitment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=102.86000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter what these elected politicians threaten or say that they're going to do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  We're going to enforce the law, period. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  And they're not going to stop us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, Governor Abbott, I watched you with great frustration do everything imaginable [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=113.1s)]
*  in your power, come up with idea after idea after idea, because you were bearing the brunt [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=119.54s)]
*  of this from the very beginning. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=125.66s)]
*  And you tried to put up barriers in the beginning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=127.9s)]
*  And then you tried to work the courts in the beginning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=130.38s)]
*  Then you started flying people out of your state to the sanctuary cities and states. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=132.3s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, people like Mayor Eric Adams, to his credit, he finally got [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=136.82s)]
*  there, realized maybe this is not such a good idea, wide open borders, because we can't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=141.38s)]
*  control what's going on here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=145.5s)]
*  How frustrating has that been for you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=147.98s)]
*  Well, listen, it is very frustrating when we have a country and a president and an administration [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=149.98s)]
*  that are fighting back against the law, inviting all this illegal immigration into our country, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=156.38s)]
*  bringing those people in who are committing those rapes, those murders and crushing the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=162.22s)]
*  families across the entire country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=166.38s)]
*  So I'm thankful that we finally have a president and President Trump who's going to enforce [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=169.18s)]
*  the laws of the United States of America. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm thankful that we have Tom Homan, as the incoming borders are, who's going to help [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=175.26s)]
*  execute those laws and enforce those laws and make sure that we get back to restoring [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=180.18s)]
*  order. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  But also, I'm thankful, especially at this time of the year, what Tom's going to help [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  me out with tomorrow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=188.62s)]
*  I'm thankful for the National Guard troops who have been serving on our border for the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=189.9s)]
*  years under the Biden administration, erecting the barriers, repelling and denying entry [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=195.34s)]
*  to people trying to enter the country illegally. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=200.58s)]
*  Those are men and women who deserve the respect of the entire United States of America, and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=203.14s)]
*  we're going to go feed them Thanksgiving dinner, Thanksgiving lunch and show them the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=207.54s)]
*  gratitude that they deserve. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=213.18s)]
*  Let me ask you, I had Senator Rand Paul, Tom, on my radio program today, and he thinks it's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=214.18s)]
*  a matter of police and ICE resources, not the military, that can be used in this effort. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=220.02s)]
*  What is your answer to that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=226.62s)]
*  Constitutionally, he says there's a problem. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  We need DOD's assistance. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=232.34s)]
*  Look, we've got millions of people we need to find. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=233.34s)]
*  And look, we've got a lot of criminal aliens, we've got a lot of national security threats. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=235.94s)]
*  We need to find these people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=240.62s)]
*  It is, I think, DOD, this is a national security vulnerability. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=242.06s)]
*  I think it's the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen since 9-11 because [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=245.14s)]
*  of the two over-2 million gotaways. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=249.18s)]
*  We already arrested a record number of people off the Terrace-Washington crossing the border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=251.34s)]
*  We know 2.2 million people paid more to get away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=254.58s)]
*  They didn't want to be vetted, didn't want to be fingerprinted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=257.58s)]
*  That scared the hell out of everybody. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=259.46s)]
*  So DOD's helped on the border on numerous administrations. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=261.06s)]
*  We need their help on the Trump administration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=263.94s)]
*  They don't have to be out arresting people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=266.1s)]
*  They can certainly help us with transportation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=267.78s)]
*  They can help us staff up groups. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=269.54s)]
*  They can help us do some of the infrastructure building. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=271.74s)]
*  They can help us with some of the logistics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=274.06s)]
*  We need DOD's help, and President Trump's committed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=276.5s)]
*  DOD's helping us, and we're going to do that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=278.9s)]
*  So again, President Trump's a tough president, and DOD's assistance is going to help us [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=281.18s)]
*  be more successful in the country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=285.46s)]
*  It's just sad that Rand Paul would say that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=288.82s)]
*  I think we all need to be on the same page. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=290.18s)]
*  Again, we all should be on the same page. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=292.18s)]
*  You're talking about the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen in this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=294.26s)]
*  nation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=297.5s)]
*  We all should be on the same pageâ€”Republicans, Democrats, independents, everybody. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=298.5s)]
*  Well, don't count on the Democrats, because all they're doing is preparing to be resisting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=302.62s)]
*  every effort you make and why they're putting the so-called rights, which illegal immigrants [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  obviously don't have, over the safety and security of Americans, the drugs, the cartels, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=312.98s)]
*  the gangs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=317.66s)]
*  The known terrorists in the country is inexplicable to me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=318.66s)]
*  Governor, you have used the National Guard. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=321.5s)]
*  You have used it successfully. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=323.38s)]
*  Would every state be able to start with that and add to the ICE personnel as well? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=325.62s)]
*  So, it's a great strategy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=330.1s)]
*  Remember this, Sean, and that is we had half of America's governors send either their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=333.1s)]
*  National Guard or DPS equivalent, Department of Public Safety equivalent, to the state [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=338.98s)]
*  of Texas. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=343.62s)]
*  From Republican states across the country, all governors were lending their support. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=344.86s)]
*  So bottom line, this has already happened. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=348.94s)]
*  In Texas, we show the way that the police force can work collaboratively with the military [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  force, where the police are doing the policing, the military are doing things like building [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=356.1s)]
*  border barriers that deny entry. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=360.98s)]
*  And so there is a very meaningful role for the military in this situation, and it's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  something that we are expecting and hoping that President Trump will use, because here's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  the deal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=373.86s)]
*  In my opinion, we don't have enough ICE agents. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=374.86s)]
*  We don't have enough Border Patrol agents. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=376.54s)]
*  We need as much manpower as we can get right now, because it's all hands on deck for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=378.62s)]
*  us to be able to deny illegal entry and to deport all those who are here illegally. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=382.38s)]
*  It's a full-time job, and we need all the people we can get to do that job. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=387.5s)]
*  What do you say, Tom Holman, to any elected official that is pledging to aid, abet and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=392.02s)]
*  assist illegal immigrants and prevent you and your team from doing the job you've [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=397.62s)]
*  been hired to do? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=404.38s)]
*  Again, I think the message is, you know, you cannot help. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=405.38s)]
*  That's your choice. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=410.34s)]
*  I can't believe you don't want to help remove public safety threats and national security [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=411.34s)]
*  threats from your communities. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=415.86s)]
*  I think that's your number one responsibility. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=417.18s)]
*  But they obviously hate President Trump more than they love their communities. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=419.58s)]
*  So look, I'll say it again. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=422.9s)]
*  Don't cross the line. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=424.3s)]
*  Do not impede us. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=425.3s)]
*  Do not knowingly harbor and conceal an alien, or there's going to be consequences. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=426.5s)]
*  Thank God we have a strong president coming in, President Trump. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=431.18s)]
*  We've got a strong secretary coming in, Christine Ohm, who I have a lot of communication with. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=433.9s)]
*  And look, me and Governor Abbott, we're already working together. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=438.3s)]
*  We're already making plans. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=441.26s)]
*  We're not waiting for January 20th. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=442.26s)]
*  The planning starts now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=443.78s)]
*  January 20th, game on. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=445.26s)]
*  So if they want to push back, push back. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=447.46s)]
*  But don't cross that line. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=449.26s)]
*  Yeah, we've got to protect every American against all of these criminals that have gotten [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=451.1s)]
*  into this country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=457.1s)]
*  And what has been done by Harris and Biden, Mayorkas, and then lying to the American people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=458.94s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=463.98s)]
*  Maybe they need to examine their conscience on this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=464.98s)]
*  Tom Homan, Governor Abbott, thank you both. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgS4gJdD4M&t=467.42s)]
