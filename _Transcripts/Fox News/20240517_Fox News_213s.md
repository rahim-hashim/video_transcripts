# Larry Kudlow FACT CHECKS Biden's 9% inflation claim
**Fox News:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA)
*  All right, now to more dirty tricks from the Biden campaign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=0.0s)]
*  They're now dangling even more government money, which we mentioned that we don't have [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=2.96s)]
*  in front of voters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=9.64s)]
*  Now they want to initiate a $25,000 down payment for first-time home buyers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=10.64s)]
*  It's almost like they want inflation to go higher, the debt, the deficit to go higher, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=16.56s)]
*  or maybe they don't understand simple economics 101. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=22.04s)]
*  Anyway, here with Analysis, Fox Business host, our friend Larry Kudlow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=26.72s)]
*  Larry, great to have you as always. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=33.8s)]
*  The Supreme Court said they shouldn't be having student loan forgiveness. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=35.36s)]
*  Now they want to buy votes with young people and home buyers and try to get people to vote [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=40.44s)]
*  from that way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  It sounds to me like, oh, well, maybe that's one way to get people to support us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Is that what is happening? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=52.84s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=55.04s)]
*  First of all, thanks for having me back, Sean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=56.04s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=57.44s)]
*  It's so interesting to me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=58.76s)]
*  All this vote buying stuff, okay, money to help mortgages, money, of course, for student [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=60.56s)]
*  loan cancellations, which is going to cost a trillion dollars, by the way, and you're [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=66.24s)]
*  running a cumulative inflation rate of 20 percent. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=71.16s)]
*  And across the board, people are complaining. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  All of these polls, whether they're swing states or nationwide, show the economy is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=79.68s)]
*  number one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=84.56s)]
*  Inflation is number one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=85.56s)]
*  Number one issue. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, immigration, illegal immigration is a close second, but it's inflation and the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=93.0s)]
*  And some good stories out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=94.36s)]
*  One of the best leading indicators of a presidential race, okay, is something called real disposable [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=96.32s)]
*  income. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=105.32s)]
*  All right, that's income, that's wages, that's what you get after inflation, after taxes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=106.32s)]
*  It's a classic presidential election indicator. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=112.48s)]
*  And you know what you got here? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=115.84s)]
*  Cumulatively, Joe Biden up 2.9 percent. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=117.72s)]
*  Donald Trump was up 12 and a half percent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=121.12s)]
*  Biden's performance is the worst in the post-World War II period. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=125.16s)]
*  His inflation of 20 percent is the worst in about 40 years, but his disposable income, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=131.2s)]
*  which is after inflation, after taxes, is the worst in the entire post-World War II period. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=137.4s)]
*  So what? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=143.08s)]
*  These guys now want to layer on more spending, which will create more inflation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=144.08s)]
*  Inflation shone first four months of the year through April, four and a half percent at [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=149.72s)]
*  an annual rate on the CPI, okay? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  And Mr. Biden did not inherit a nine percent inflation rate from Donald Trump. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=158.06s)]
*  He inherited a 1.4 percent inflation rate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I'm afraid he did. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  So I'm just saying, all this vote by and Sean, it's not what people want, because they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  already sick of government spending and inflation, which is killing their paychecks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=179.08s)]
*  Well said. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=180.08s)]
*  Last three months inflation, 3.2 percent year over year, 3.5 percent year over year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=181.4s)]
*  This month, oh, we're down, it's only 3.4 percent year over year. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  No, that's a high number, over 20 plus percent since he became president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=191.76s)]
*  It's killing American families. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=196.2s)]
*  Larry, thank you as always. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=198.6s)]
*  You're the best. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZgxKcS4UA&t=200.12s)]
