# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 8, 2024
**Fox News:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight. The unserious woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Democrats are in a box. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  They're trapped inside and it's a box of their own making. Slowly but surely, Kamala Harris [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=16.16s)]
*  is being exposed for what she is. An empty pantsuit. Even when obvious questions are asked, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=22.32s)]
*  she won't answer them. You have changed your position on so many things. You were against [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=31.12s)]
*  fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies. Now you're tightening them [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that in the last four years, I have been [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=51.28s)]
*  vice president United States and I have been traveling our country and I have been listening [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=57.6s)]
*  to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=62.24s)]
*  We are diverse people geographically, regionally in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=70.4s)]
*  And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing as long as you don't [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=83.28s)]
*  compromise your values to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=88.0s)]
*  How does that explain the flip flopping again? Well, after this interview, Americans will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=97.28s)]
*  understand why that the campaign had to keep her so sheltered. But that strategy allowed Donald [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=101.76s)]
*  Trump to run the table. And since the debate, he's been on the move almost without a break. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  He's the Energizer Bunny candidate, which is making the media and Democrats very, very anxious. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=114.56s)]
*  She's got such a big problem with men. I mean, there's an under account of the Trump vote. I [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=120.48s)]
*  think that it was misogynization in all of this. Black and white men, big problem, but also the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  business world, they don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=130.8s)]
*  Because she's not a heavyweight. Now think about it. Since the coup against Biden, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  they've tried to promote her as the true change candidate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=141.12s)]
*  I think people are exhausted and they're ready to turn the page and chart a new way forward. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=145.68s)]
*  I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are ready to turn the page. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  I think we all know it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. Well, folks, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=156.08s)]
*  it's time to turn the page. But today on The View, Kamala blew up her own narrative. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=170.0s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind. Nothing that comes to mind. So much for being the change [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  candidate. How does she not have a prepared answer for that question, by the way? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=183.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris just wrote a devastating campaign commercial for the Trump campaign. Inflation, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=189.68s)]
*  Afghanistan, the border, all a disaster under Biden. And she can't think of anything she [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=196.48s)]
*  should do differently. Has the woman not seen the right track, wrong track surveys that are out there? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=202.72s)]
*  Yeah, not good. If you like the direction that we're going in as a country, high gas prices, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=209.52s)]
*  high grocery bills, the high cost of insurance, going to take away your car, the gas powered car, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=215.28s)]
*  health care costs, Kamala is definitely your gal. She's just another puppet of the failed establishment. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=220.56s)]
*  She's Biden without the experience. A serious candidate doesn't avoid doing a real press [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=228.32s)]
*  conference and then sit down with a sex and dating podcaster. Can you tell the daddy gang [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=235.68s)]
*  when people tell you no, when people look at you and doubt you, what does that ignite in you? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=242.56s)]
*  I don't hear no. I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang. Don't hear no. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  A serious candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=259.28s)]
*  masterful in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=266.4s)]
*  NBC is reporting Governor DeSantis is ignoring your calls on hurricanes, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=273.68s)]
*  resources and help. How does that hurt the situation here? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=278.96s)]
*  It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish and it is about political [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=284.0s)]
*  gamesmanship. Instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=289.04s)]
*  Now to call her response dim-witted is an insult to dim wits everywhere. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=295.6s)]
*  She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=301.84s)]
*  whose state is about to get hit by the worst hurricane in what, a century? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=307.52s)]
*  We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, around the clock 24 seven. She has never [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. Why all [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=319.44s)]
*  of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=325.52s)]
*  in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear, it's just another fumble, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=337.68s)]
*  a fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field in the first place. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=345.2s)]
*  She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, engaged enough [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=350.48s)]
*  to let her twist in the wind. The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=356.72s)]
*  all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=362.48s)]
*  It's all being done well. We thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=369.12s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page because even in his diminished state, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=376.24s)]
*  he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=383.92s)]
*  questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=391.52s)]
*  handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=411.68s)]
*  Which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=422.0s)]
*  majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=438.24s)]
*  race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote and I'm going to work to do that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=445.44s)]
*  But increasingly it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=452.48s)]
*  lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=457.12s)]
*  And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=466.64s)]
*  Hi, I'm Bruce Springsteen. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walz for vice president [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=472.96s)]
*  and opposing Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=479.68s)]
*  Glory days have passed you by. And you know, Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. I've even heard they're going to beg George [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=489.84s)]
*  W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=496.48s)]
*  of performing the type of functions that we as Americans associate with being the president of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  the United States. She doesn't understand the issues at the level of detail necessary to make [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=510.88000000000005s)]
*  effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political support necessary to bend official [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=516.4s)]
*  Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment needed to read the moods of foreign [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=522.48s)]
*  leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried having a figurehead president with Biden, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=536.24s)]
*  And yet now they're doing the same thing, only she's even less serious at a time when we face [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=540.64s)]
*  countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell serious trouble. And that's the angle. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=547.28s)]
*  Oh, Barack's not happy. After hiding Harris all fall, Democrats watched her numbers drop. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=554.88s)]
*  It was time to change strategy. Obama ordered Kamala, you're doing immediate blitz, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  but Harris couldn't handle the pressure. She couldn't even survive the view. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=567.28s)]
*  If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=572.48s)]
*  past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=578.8s)]
*  of, of most of the decisions that have had impact. This was the one excuse she had for not solving [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=585.6s)]
*  problems for four years. Hey, you know, I was only VP. I don't call the shots. This was her one saving [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=593.28s)]
*  grace that let people think maybe she's not Joe Biden. Maybe she can be different. Maybe she can [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=599.76s)]
*  bring change. And she just went on the view and said, I'm Joe Biden. I wouldn't have done [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  anything differently the last four years at the debate. She declared I'm not Joe Biden. And today [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  she says she is. She even flip-flopped on whether she's Joe Biden. Afghanistan wouldn't have done [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=615.92s)]
*  anything differently. Inflation, the border, if she had to go back and do it over, she would [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  have done everything the same. If she had a time machine, she'd hurt the country all over again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=628.88s)]
*  She has no regrets. She must really hate you. Joe Biden was so unpopular, he got whacked by [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=634.64s)]
*  Democrats, and she learned nothing from that. She just went on live TV and said, yep, Biden, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=642.08s)]
*  that's my guy. I'm a Biden Democrat. Now we know how Kamala climbed her way to the top, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=649.04s)]
*  blind loyalty. And now that she's all alone at the top, she doesn't know what to do with herself. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=656.0s)]
*  She's still kissing up to the guy she cooed. This whole election is about change. And she just went [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=663.36s)]
*  on TV and said, I'm more of the same. She handed Trump the one campaign ad that Democrats were [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=670.48s)]
*  dreading. CNN can't believe it. I'm surprised, frankly, that she doesn't have more to say about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=677.6s)]
*  this, given that she and her campaign know that this is one of the main questions that voters have [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=684.96s)]
*  about her. And one of the main things she's been trying to establish as part of her candidacy [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  is the idea that she would represent a break from the past four years. And to not be able to come [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  up with something to say in that moment, she continues to not be particularly nimble on her [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  feet in a lot of these interviews. Who would have thought the view would trip up the Harris campaign? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  They were giving her an opportunity to say, I'm proud to serve with Joe Biden, and I'm proud of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=712.08s)]
*  X, Y, and Z, what we did. But I would have told the Fed to wake up and raise rates much earlier, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=718.08s)]
*  crush inflation. And the next four years, I'll show you what I'm made of. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=724.32s)]
*  How am I better at being Harris than Harris? She's been doing this her whole life. She's not very [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=729.12s)]
*  good at it. And if you think she was unprepared for the view, watch her on 60 Minutes. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=735.28s)]
*  The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=742.24s)]
*  knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  The rivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=754.72s)]
*  to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing problem. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=762.96s)]
*  And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=770.56s)]
*  What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=777.6s)]
*  I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=785.04s)]
*  not promoting a problem. Okay. But the numbers did quadruple. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=790.96s)]
*  She can't even answer the question because she never tried to fix the border until it was an [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=796.0s)]
*  election year. She claims she sent an immigration bill to Congress on day one and it wasn't taken [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=800.88s)]
*  up. Well, primetime producers investigated because, from all we remembered, out of the gate, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=807.04s)]
*  Biden signed seven executive orders shredding Trump's border policies. We didn't recall a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=812.48s)]
*  Biden-Harris immigration bill on inauguration day because Biden-Harris didn't propose a bill [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=818.16s)]
*  fixing the immigration system. We discovered they submitted an amnesty bill that would give [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=825.12s)]
*  citizenship to all of the illegals in the country. And part of that bill, you can't call them [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=831.76s)]
*  illegals. You have to call them undocumented. Nancy and Chuck controlled the House and the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=837.6s)]
*  Senate back then. No wonder they didn't take it up. It was political suicide. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=843.2s)]
*  The bill was just a ruse, just like the border bill this year. Kamala said Bidenomics was working [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=848.4s)]
*  and the border was secure for four years. Now she's saying she has a bunch of solutions to the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=855.44s)]
*  problems she said weren't problems. It's a long-standing problem and solutions are at hand. And [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=860.56s)]
*  from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. Because solutions are at hand and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=869.68s)]
*  solutions are at hand. So the solution to the border is to blame Trump. What's the solution to high prices? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=876.8s)]
*  Groceries are 25 percent higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=884.24s)]
*  To your point, prices are still too high. And I know that and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=893.2s)]
*  you mentioned groceries, part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris then never shares her plan to bring down grocery prices. Bill Whittaker at CBS News [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  is forced to tell the audience this. Listen. Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=914.24s)]
*  on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined. What is Bill Whittaker, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=920.8s)]
*  her interpreter? Inflation is the number one issue in the country. She's on 60 minutes, a month before [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=927.12s)]
*  the election, and the press has to explain what Harris's plan is because she didn't. And CBS is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=934.16s)]
*  forced to say, like, here's her plan, but there's no details. What am I watching? What promise has [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=940.56s)]
*  Kamala ever kept? She said she'd wire rural America with broadband, never did it. She said she'd build [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  car chargers, never did it. She said she'd secure the border, never did it. Bring down prices, never [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=955.76s)]
*  did it. Why are we hiring a woman who's never kept a single promise? At one point in the interview, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=960.88s)]
*  60 Minutes was like, who are you? The reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=966.72s)]
*  your position on so many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=982.24s)]
*  So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=989.0400000000001s)]
*  heard that. In the last four years, I have been vice president of the United States and I have been [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=995.92s)]
*  traveling our country and I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1001.28s)]
*  common ground. I believe in building consensus. Kamala hasn't been seeking common ground. She's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1008.24s)]
*  been seeking common sense. All of these positions she's just adopted are common sense conservative [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1014.24s)]
*  positions. She didn't build consensus. She's just agreeing with the rest of the country now to get [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1020.96s)]
*  elected. 60 Minutes was like, you realize you didn't earn this, right? Was democracy best served [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1026.88s)]
*  by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1036.32s)]
*  through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1043.52s)]
*  system was intended to work. I am proud to have received the endorsement of leaders around this [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1049.6s)]
*  country from every background and walk of life to fight in this election over the next month [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1056.32s)]
*  for our democracy. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1065.04s)]
*  really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. Kamala struggled to justify [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1073.92s)]
*  why she's running for president and even why she's the nominee. And if you wanted the country to get [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  to know you, why have you been hiding? Everybody that's gotten to know Kamala quit. 72% of her [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1086.24s)]
*  staff worked for her, found out who she was and just walked off the job. All she does ever is talk [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1092.5600000000002s)]
*  about Trump. The country's bored by that. They want to hear from politicians. How are you going [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1098.88s)]
*  to help the country? When you hear, you know, the Vance's and the Trump's talking about what's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1104.16s)]
*  happening here at home and saying things like America first and make America great again, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1109.68s)]
*  that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more. Absolutely. Not sometimes. It does resonate a lot [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1113.92s)]
*  more. Democrats see the numbers. Internal polling has Kamala losing Michigan. And now in Wisconsin, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1118.96s)]
*  Democrats say Harris is down three. This is what gamblers do when they're down, double their bets [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1126.08s)]
*  to get out of the hole. That's what Obama's pulling here. Kamala is down. So let's double her media [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1132.24s)]
*  and see if we get lucky. If the bet works, Obama's a genius and he can relax with his martini in [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1137.84s)]
*  Hawaii. If it doesn't work, Biden's going to say, see, Barry, I told you so. Why do you think I [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1144.0s)]
*  didn't let her out of the White House? So Barry's about to get humiliated. His only option is to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1151.44s)]
*  save the Senate. So the Messiah is cutting ads for politicians we've never heard of. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1157.68s)]
*  Building a better future starts by electing people who know you, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  who see you and who understand what you're going through. That's why it's so important to reelect [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1168.16s)]
*  Jackie Rosen. Jackie who? The whole reason Barack bounced Joe is because he was going to lose the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1174.72s)]
*  White House and the Senate. If Kamala was the answer, why did they all of a sudden need Barack [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1181.04s)]
*  to save the Senate? It doesn't matter. Barack will just blame Nancy. And welcome to Hannity. And [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1186.8s)]
*  tonight, category five Hurricane Milton is only hours away from slamming into the already battered [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1192.56s)]
*  communities on Florida's Gulf Coast, right here in the free state of Florida. Many are now rightly [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1198.0s)]
*  worried that this very powerful storm could in fact be the most destructive hurricane in history. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1203.92s)]
*  Florida officials are now telling residents who refuse to evacuate, write your name on your body [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1210.56s)]
*  so you can be identified if and when you die. Now coming up, we'll have a live report from Fox [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  Weather. But first, we are just 28 days until an inflection point for our country. That is called [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1221.44s)]
*  Election Day. A political storm is brewing across the country as the hurricane is now [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1226.48s)]
*  bearing down on Florida. Kamala Harris, she decided to pick a fight with Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1232.32s)]
*  who's busy trying to save the lives of Floridians and also prestaging 30,000 utility trucks [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1238.16s)]
*  and trucks with water and food and medicine and supplies. And she's trashing him in public for [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1245.2s)]
*  not taking the time to speak with her on the phone, a call that he never received. Last night on this [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1251.28s)]
*  program, Governor Ron DeSantis responded. Take a look. For Kamala Harris to try to say that my [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1257.6000000000001s)]
*  sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional. She has no role in this. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1264.32s)]
*  In fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years. I've dealt with a number of storms [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1272.56s)]
*  under this administration. She has never contributed anything to any of these efforts. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1277.4399999999998s)]
*  And so what I think is selfish is her trying to blunder into this. No, I've had storms under both [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1282.8s)]
*  President Trump and President Biden, and I've worked well with both of them. She's the first one [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1289.84s)]
*  who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because of her campaign. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1295.6s)]
*  She never one time, never before, ever called Governor DeSantis before, during, or after any [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1303.84s)]
*  other hurricane. And Kamala's trying to pretend that she cares about hurricanes for the very [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1309.2s)]
*  first time ever. And DeSantis, as per usual, is working around the clock trying to save lives [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1314.64s)]
*  and property. And meanwhile, Kamala's boss, Joe Biden, he doesn't seem interested in his vice [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1321.0400000000002s)]
*  president's dishonest brand of politics. And for the second time this week, Joe Biden has overshadowed [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1327.2800000000002s)]
*  Kamala's public appearances with his own counter programming. And today, at the very moment that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1333.92s)]
*  Kamala was meeting with that hard-hitting news show, The Ladies of the View, while smearing [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1339.92s)]
*  DeSantis again, Biden talked to reporters at the White House, and he preys on the Florida governor, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  my governor. Take a look. The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1352.0s)]
*  he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1358.3200000000002s)]
*  being all being done well. We thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1364.8s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala Harris has literally offered no help to North Carolina, no help to Georgia, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1371.2s)]
*  South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, none. She's been out on the campaign trail, out in Hollywood, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1376.8s)]
*  raising money. And you may have noticed that both Joe and Jill Biden have been largely absent from [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1381.9199999999998s)]
*  the campaign trail. Many now speculating that the Harris campaign was trying to put distance between [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  the failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration. But today, that hard-hitting [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1392.24s)]
*  interview that she had on The View, if, you know, asked if she would do anything differently over [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1397.44s)]
*  the past four years, Kamala said, not a thing. She wouldn't change a thing. Take a look. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1402.56s)]
*  The influence of a personal experience will have its impact on the presidency? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1410.08s)]
*  Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1415.04s)]
*  during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1421.52s)]
*  and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1427.2s)]
*  But on day one, she's going to change inflation. On day one, she's going to fix the border. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1434.0s)]
*  Day one was January 20th, 2021. Not a thing, really. Not the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1438.32s)]
*  She was the last person in the room. 13 American troops dead. Let's see, hundreds of Americans [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1448.4s)]
*  left behind enemy lines, not the carnage overseas funded by Iranian mullahs with the billions that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1454.5600000000002s)]
*  she and Joe made available to them. They helped make Iran rich again. What about the record-setting [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1461.44s)]
*  inflation caused by a historic level of new spending from Biden and Harris? What about the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1467.0400000000002s)]
*  border crisis? A record 12-plus unvetted illegals from over 180 countries, many with terror ties, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  many from countries that are top geopolitical foes pouring into the country as her time as [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1480.96s)]
*  border czar. And tonight, our very own Bill Mollusian is reporting that the FBI just arrested [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  an Afghan national allowed in under Harris and Biden, who is plotting an ISIS-inspired [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  terror attack on election day. Oh, and we do have Iranian assassination squads in our country [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1498.72s)]
*  trying to kill Donald Trump. On 60 Minutes of what became a train wreck interview, it was supposed [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1504.96s)]
*  to be a layup interview, Kamala Harris was asked not once, not twice, but three times if it was a [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1510.56s)]
*  mistake to allow millions of unvetted illegal immigrants into the country. She refuses to answer [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1516.88s)]
*  the question. What a shock. Take a look. Arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1522.88s)]
*  Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1531.44s)]
*  problem and solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1539.8400000000001s)]
*  What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1548.32s)]
*  The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1556.88s)]
*  But the numbers did quadruple under your watch. And the numbers today, because of what we have done, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1563.84s)]
*  we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. But should you have done that? We have [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1569.52s)]
*  cut the flow of fentanyl by half. But we need Congress to be able to act. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1574.64s)]
*  Was it a mistake? The numbers quadrupled. Your the borders are. No answer. Now, coming up tonight, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1583.8400000000001s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he'll join us. He will respond to Kamala's lies and deflections. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1590.4s)]
*  Now, of course, that 60-minute interview, that should have been a walk in the park for Kamala [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1595.44s)]
*  Harris. It was designed for her to have a walk in the park. Many of the vice president's worst [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1600.72s)]
*  word salads were actually edited from the interview, shocking from abusively biased CBS. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  But it was still a disaster for Kamala. And that's only the beginning. As panic over poll [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1613.44s)]
*  numbers start to set in, the Harris campaign, that's the only reason they're sending Kamala [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1618.72s)]
*  on this media blitz with friendly outlets. CBS, Colbert, The View, Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1623.6s)]
*  Let's see. Oh, Howard Stern. We can't forget about Howard Stern's interview, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1633.6s)]
*  because she sat down earlier with the former once great shock jock. I don't know. He's a shadow of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1638.56s)]
*  his former self. What the hell happened to Howard? Will the real Howard ever one day come back? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1643.6s)]
*  Sadly, now himself is an erotic, woke, polo-loving, cat-loving shadow of his former self, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1649.28s)]
*  holier-than-thou liberal who calls any Trump supporter stupid. He doesn't want them, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1657.68s)]
*  I guess, to listen to his program anymore. Paralyzed by the fear of COVID-19, asking nothing [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1662.48s)]
*  but pathetic, meaningless questions and discussing Kamala's favorite brand of cereal? Gee, Howard. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1668.16s)]
*  Will the real Howard come back to life? Take a look. Why are you eating for breakfast? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1675.84s)]
*  Raisin Bran, I read. I feel that's not, for someone who's healthy and you have a good figure, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  why raisin bran? There's a lot of sugar. Well, no. So I don't eat raisin bran every morning, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  but if you asked me what was my favorite cereal, I would put it right up there with, okay, now this [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1693.6799999999998s)]
*  is going to be obnoxious and special K. Special K is. Well, it's really great. Plus, my mother [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1698.9599999999998s)]
*  used to make these special K cookies in honor of me. Will the real Howard Stern please return [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1704.64s)]
*  to life? And who cares what cereal the Kamala Harris likes? Is this going to move the political [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1712.24s)]
*  needle? Any of these interviews? Not a chance. And by the way, what cereal that Kamala loves costs [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1717.44s)]
*  about 28% more since she became vice president. In fact, most things in America are up over 20%. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1724.16s)]
*  And while it doesn't seem to matter to the multimillionaires giving softball interviews [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1731.92s)]
*  to Kamala Harris, these price hikes are like a massive hidden tax for most American families, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1736.0s)]
*  many of which are putting bare necessities on credit cards. But again, as she said on the view, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1742.24s)]
*  there's not a thing she would have done differently, which brings us back to her [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  administration's terrible hurricane response, the worst in American history. Did you know that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1751.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris regularly skipped the hurricane preparedness briefings too busy hanging out with [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1757.36s)]
*  her Hollywood friends and it kind of seems pretty important now, doesn't it? Well, that's only the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1763.1999999999998s)]
*  tip of the iceberg. Pay attention closely under Biden and Harris, FEMA, they had a preoccupation. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1768.9599999999998s)]
*  That preoccupation was with woke politics. The information is right there on fema.com. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1776.0s)]
*  They're calling it fake news, but it's in their own words. There are three stated goals on FEMA's [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1783.44s)]
*  website, quote, instill equity as a foundation of emergency management. According to the wordy [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1790.0800000000002s)]
*  description, this goal is about prioritizing and tailoring emergency management for certain races [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1798.0s)]
*  and gender identities. The second goal, quote, lead whole of community and climate resilience. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1804.8s)]
*  Of course, this was all about the left and their religious obsession about global warming and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1812.64s)]
*  climate change. The very last goal is about emergency preparedness. So you can see what the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1818.8s)]
*  administration is prioritizing. How about this? How about if there's a natural disaster, like [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1824.96s)]
*  there's been in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, how about you [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1832.16s)]
*  help out every American in need? And how about you not steal the money from FEMA and give it [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1838.56s)]
*  to your unvetted illegal immigrants from 180 countries? Because their illegal immigrants [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1844.32s)]
*  seem to be prioritized and are way more important than the American people, the people that are now [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1850.8s)]
*  currently suffering and not getting the help they need in spite of proclamations to the contrary. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1856.8s)]
*  You have DHS Secretary Alejandro Muorquez saying FEMA's running out of money and going bankrupt. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1862.96s)]
*  Bankrupt? This has not been a busy hurricane season. This, after the FEMA directed more than [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  $1 billion to pay for housing and food for Harris Biden illegal immigrants, because this story [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1876.08s)]
*  looks really bad for Democrats in charge, they are trying to just outright lie to you and pretend [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1883.8400000000001s)]
*  this is misinformation. This is a deep fake statement by conservatives. Well, it's also on [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1891.12s)]
*  the FEMA website. It's completely truthful. It's completely real. Just like Hunter Biden laptop was [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1897.36s)]
*  not misinformation, but very real. Democrats, the state run media mob, they simply lie. They push [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1904.08s)]
*  propaganda before elections. Here we go again. But in April press release from FEMA's own website, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1910.48s)]
*  let me read it to you. It states the following. Today, the Department of Homeland Security through [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1917.12s)]
*  FEMA and the US Customs and Border Protection announced 300 million in grants through the [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1922.2399999999998s)]
*  shelter and services program, which was authorized by Congress to support communities that are [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1927.84s)]
*  providing services to migrants. Let me interpret. That means illegal alien, a word that Kamala wants [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1933.28s)]
*  you to be courageous enough to never use, like radical Islamic terrorists. She wants you to be [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1940.3999999999999s)]
*  courageous and never use that word either. It goes on. Additionally, DHS is announcing $340.9 million [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1945.68s)]
*  through the shelter and services program and their competitive grant program to be allocated [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1954.64s)]
*  before the end of the fiscal year. The last two years, over a billion dollars from FEMA to help [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1959.92s)]
*  Harris and Biden illegal immigrants. It is not a deep fake. It's not misinformation. It is the truth. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  This is the Biden-Harris administration caught red-handed, dedicating a massive amount of money [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1974.48s)]
*  that was supposed to be there for emergency relief for Americans in North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1981.2s)]
*  and elsewhere to dispense to illegal immigrants while hurricane ravaged victims all over the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1987.76s)]
*  country are left out to dry. Again, it's about their priorities. And under Biden and Harris, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1993.84s)]
*  the American people also seem to come last. Now, earlier today, Sarah Carter, she was asking [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1999.36s)]
*  North Carolinians about FEMA's lackluster response. Here is what they had to say. Take a look. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2005.76s)]
*  A lot of residents have felt when I speak to them, they say, you know what, it's been 12 days. I feel [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2012.32s)]
*  abandoned. I haven't seen any response. Now some response is coming through. Some FEMA representatives [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2017.84s)]
*  are down on the ground. It's been 12 days later. It should have been sooner. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2024.16s)]
*  It should have been immediate. It should have been immediate. And I'll tell you what, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2031.2s)]
*  thank God for the people of North Carolina, the residents, the fire chiefs. We have the two best [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2034.48s)]
*  fire chiefs in this area in the world. I mean, their response time from our citizens, our residents, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  they're supporting us. I mean, that's who's going to rebuild this community. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  President Biden basically made a statement saying that people are getting what they need, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2050.48s)]
*  that they're happy. Are you getting what you need? Are you happy? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2056.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. We're getting what we need, but it's from people in Jimmy Rock, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2059.12s)]
*  like not from the government at all. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2064.88s)]
*  Like the basic necessities from your friends. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2067.28s)]
*  Yeah. But the bigger picture, no. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2069.36s)]
*  We're not happy. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2073.36s)]
*  No. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2074.08s)]
*  The message right now is just help. I mean, there's really not much more I can say. We need help. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2074.8s)]
*  We're American citizens. We're hardworking. We do our jobs. We volunteer. We're part of the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2081.2s)]
*  community, part of the team. And we just need support. I've never really asked for anything [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2086.48s)]
*  in my life. And now I'm asking. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2092.96s)]
