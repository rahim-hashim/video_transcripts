# America can do so much better than this: Eric Trump
**Fox News:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM)
*  Joining us now with reaction to all of this and all that you've heard so far from the DNC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric Trump is with us. I'm not sure if I was you or your father or frankly anybody in your family [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=4.88s)]
*  would be that interested in watching a lot of what's going on here, but I'm sure there's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=12.24s)]
*  probably some interest on your part and I want to get your reaction. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=16.56s)]
*  You know Sean, Laura turned to me last night and she goes, I've never seen a production that's as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=22.0s)]
*  dark as this and your split screen right now, I mean it says it all. It tells the full story. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=26.16s)]
*  Look at that, look at those riots, look what they're doing to cops. Literally they had [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=31.36s)]
*  they had images of people coming up and spitting on cops, cursing at cops, calling them pigs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=35.6s)]
*  This is the modern day Democratic party. You went back to Milwaukee, look at the convention that we [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  had. We didn't have anything other than love. We had American flags, we had people you know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=46.16s)]
*  who were singing God bless America. We had people who had tears in their eyes when my father came [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=50.72s)]
*  out. They love this country, they love our nation, they love our constitution, they love [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=55.52s)]
*  everything that makes America great and then look at the parallel that you're seeing right up there [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=59.6s)]
*  on the screen where again cops are getting abused, people are rioting in the streets, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  there's disorder. I mean this isn't America, we're so much better than this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  You know I will say this, I do believe and I got into this with Senator Cruz, if the campaign [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=73.2s)]
*  becomes about issues, if it becomes about immigration, if it becomes about law and order, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  if it becomes about energy, if it becomes about the economy and America's place in the world and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=84.0s)]
*  America's role in the world, I think you have a very different election. But we have been watching [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=88.96s)]
*  you know I don't know what else to say. I mean it's sort of like an illusion that every position [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=95.44s)]
*  that Kamala Harris has taken publicly in her own words there at least through her campaign [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=101.76s)]
*  because she won't do an interview or a press conference like your dad has done two in two weeks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=108.08s)]
*  and her campaign tells us she no longer believes that anymore. I'm not so sure I believe in this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=113.84s)]
*  election year conversion. It sounds to me like they've decided probably through polling [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=119.92s)]
*  that if she stands by her value system she loses. So they've got to change her [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=125.12s)]
*  into something she really isn't which means she's going to revert to form if she ever got elected. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=132.56s)]
*  Do you agree with that? Yeah well Sean it's one of the great rebrandings. I mean in the media, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=137.92s)]
*  the media should be embarrassed of itself in this country right now. I mean it's awful what they do [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=143.76s)]
*  but they try and rebrand her every day. Three weeks ago they were laughing at her now they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=148.32s)]
*  trying to rebrand her and she's coming out on day one. My number one priority will be tackling [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=152.64s)]
*  prices in this country. It's Kamala where have you been for the last three and a half years? Where [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  are you right now? If you want to do something about prices in this country go do it right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=161.44s)]
*  You know she says I want to be tough on immigration. Tough on immigration. You've [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=166.56s)]
*  let 13 million people across the southern border. You picked a vice president that said if Donald [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=170.4s)]
*  Trump builds a 25-foot wall you're going to build a ladder factory in Mexico that builds 30-foot [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=175.68s)]
*  ladders. I mean this is her policy and now I want to be tough on immigration while they fly 320,000 [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=181.76s)]
*  illegal immigrants into the country and they leave the entire border open. It's not believable. No [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=189.2s)]
*  one believes these people. They haven't done a damn thing for this country. Our country [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=196.16s)]
*  has been so diminished under their leadership. People can't afford to live. People can't afford [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=200.48s)]
*  to get mortgages. People can't afford to buy groceries. Gasoline is off the charts. I mean [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=205.28s)]
*  everything is misfunctioning. The Middle East is a hornet's nest. Russia is a mess. You know [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=210.88s)]
*  our standing in the world is just diminished. You know issue after issue. Where are these people? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=216.4s)]
*  America doesn't have leadership right now. America doesn't have a cheerleader right now [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=223.12s)]
*  and yet they they come out with these promises and effectively copy my father's platform. I mean [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=227.76s)]
*  even down to my father coming down saying I will not tax tips. I will not tax social security and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=233.84s)]
*  then last week you hear Kamala Harris copy the exact same words. Oh I have a new platform. I'm [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=240.32s)]
*  not going to tax tips. It's really embarrassing and it's really embarrassing that the media allows [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=245.52s)]
*  them to do it when their positions have been totally contrary to it you know for the last [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=250.56s)]
*  three and a half years. Well I think there are two things though that show an opportunity for your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=255.44s)]
*  dad and for his campaign. One and we went through over and over again the McLaughlin poll that showed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=260.24s)]
*  that even most Democrats and Biden independents had no idea that she had taken this position [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=266.32s)]
*  about Medicare and no fracking and no drilling and that she had taken this these radical positions [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=272.24s)]
*  on the border to decriminalize free health care education free housing and you get a driver's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=278.8s)]
*  license in Minnesota etc. They don't know they don't know about defund dismantle no bail. They [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=284.08s)]
*  don't know about how they helped Iran get rich again by ignoring sanctions and I think that's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=291.2s)]
*  a big challenge now for the Trump campaign especially because you know you're coming up [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  against the clock. We're 28 days away from early voting in Pennsylvania. Ballots go out earlier [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=302.0s)]
*  in other states. You know Sean they might not know it but they can feel it. I can tell you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=306.64s)]
*  the American people can feel the mess that this country is in right now. You saw it Don Lemon. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=313.36s)]
*  Don Lemon walked down the street with a microphone asking people in Chicago who they're voting for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=318.0s)]
*  and time after time people are saying I'm voting for Donald Trump because this country is just in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  an awful spot. People can feel it. People know what's happening in Washington. People can feel [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=328.4s)]
*  the prices. You know they've had stagnant wages. Prices on everything have gone through the roof. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=333.36s)]
*  The country's not stable. Our standing is not stable around the world. I'm telling you people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=338.88s)]
*  in their heart of hearts can feel it. They can put on the greatest show that they want. You're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=343.68s)]
*  seeing the split screen right now. You're seeing the chaos which just follows the Democratic Party [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=348.32s)]
*  but I'm telling you Sean come November 5th people are going to vote my father back into office and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  we're going to have the greatest country we've ever had before. We're going to make America great [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  again. He's going to make this country proud again. I'm telling you that's going to happen. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=360.8s)]
*  When you look at a party like we're we're waiting for example and we're probably going to dip in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=365.44s)]
*  and take some of this. Bernie Sanders will be speaking. The socialist as he self-identified [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  from Vermont. We saw AOC last night. This represents the radical wing of this party. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  She had an opportunity to go for example for vice president with somebody more moderate but instead [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=382.8s)]
*  she went with the most the Bernie Sanders of governors if you will and you know common history [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=388.4s)]
*  with Bernie she's to the left of him as a senator in 2019 but she co-sponsored Medicare for All, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=394.4s)]
*  Universal Health Care that will eliminate all private health insurance and the Green New Deal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=400.96s)]
*  93 trillion dollars. That's not capitalism Eric. That's not the America we grew up in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=405.2s)]
*  The greatest wealth creating system on earth. No it's not. They want 87,000 more IRS agents [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=410.56s)]
*  no Sean's embarrassing and I mean they pick a platform they pick a vice president where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=418.32s)]
*  his greatest accomplishment was putting tampons in boys bathrooms in Minnesota. This isn't serious. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=422.0s)]
*  Sean we have real problems as a country. We have economic problems. We have social problems. We [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=428.24s)]
*  have a whole host of problems in this country and again the person who is picked biggest [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=433.36s)]
*  accomplishment tampons in boys bathrooms. This isn't serious. We can do so much better than this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=439.68s)]
*  All right Eric Trump we appreciate it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgU9fs-bTM&t=445.84s)]
