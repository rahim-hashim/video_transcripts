# Sean Hannity: The Democratic Party is the party of coastal elites
**Fox News:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0)
*  Our start-top story tonight, complete and total devastation, from Hurricane Helene across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, entire towns literally wiped out [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=5.68s)]
*  by floodwaters as the death toll continues to rise, with hundreds still missing tonight, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=12.14s)]
*  and with roads and bridges wiped out, thousands still stranded, many without power, Internet, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=18.86s)]
*  even the ability to communicate, many without clean tap water. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=24.64s)]
*  This is, by every measure, a national emergency, and today, Donald Trump, he flew to Valdosta, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=28.64s)]
*  Georgia to witness the devastation up front and personal and firsthand, and meet with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=35.4s)]
*  disaster relief specialists from Franklin Graham himself and Samaritan's Purse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=41.4s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=46.2s)]
*  Many thousands are without power. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=47.2s)]
*  They're running low on food and fuel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=49.24s)]
*  We brought a lot of it down with us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=50.92s)]
*  It's going to be distributed now or soon throughout Georgia, as well as North Carolina, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=53.36s)]
*  South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Tennessee. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=58.76s)]
*  Homes, hospitals, highways, and cars have been plunged underwater. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=62.2s)]
*  Entire neighborhoods have been turned into lakes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=66.16s)]
*  Nobody's seen anything like it, and every family that's been displaced here in Georgia [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=68.88s)]
*  and North Carolina, which has really been hit, we're going there also, and they don't [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  have communication. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  They don't have anything right now that they're... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  We're trying to... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  I just spoke to Elon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm getting him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  We want to get Starlink hooked up because they have no communication whatsoever, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Elon... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=92.84s)]
*  Elon will always come through. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=93.84s)]
*  We know that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=95.2s)]
*  Now, noticeably missing on the ground, the current president, Joe Biden, Vice President [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=96.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=102.04s)]
*  Now, Kamala, well, she spent the weekend on the West Coast where she attended a very glitzy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=103.04s)]
*  in Los Angeles with her Hollywood friends. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=108.92s)]
*  What have I been saying? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=111.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party today is now a party of coastal elites, Hollywood, New York, D.C. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=113.42s)]
*  Republicans are now the party of the hardworking men and women, the people that really make [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=121.16s)]
*  this country great. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=125.32s)]
*  And of course, Kamala did, however, she did find the time to post a staged picture on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=127.08s)]
*  X, at least pretending to care about the people in the Southeast. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=132.6s)]
*  Joe Biden, he spent all weekend at the beach in Delaware, you know, claiming to be on his [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=136.2s)]
*  phone, but we know he was relaxing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=140.64s)]
*  They said that Joe was on his phone a lot, managing the disaster recovery from afar. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's, you know, hands-on and compassionate. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=151.88s)]
*  On the hurricane, Mr. President, why weren't you and Vice President Harris here in Washington [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=152.88s)]
*  commanding this, this weekend? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=157.72s)]
*  I was commanded. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=158.72s)]
*  I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=159.72s)]
*  I command. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=165.92s)]
*  Call the telephone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=166.92s)]
*  Is it not important for the country to see? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=167.92s)]
*  All right, time for a Hannity history lesson. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's go back to 2005. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  George W. Bush, you might recall he was vilified. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=178.56s)]
*  He was demonized. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  He was called a racist. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=184.48s)]
*  For flying over the devastation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=185.48s)]
*  He didn't want to get in the way of recovery efforts two days after Hurricane Katrina and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=186.48s)]
*  looking down from Air Force One. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=191.2s)]
*  Two days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=193.32s)]
*  Now it's been nearly five days since what happened last week. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=194.32s)]
*  Two days after that hurricane made landfall. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=197.36s)]
*  You might recall the hysteria and the name calling and the blame that came his way. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=200.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=207.6s)]
*  I believe that we can charge the government with criminal neglect of the people of New [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=208.6s)]
*  Orleans, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Louisiana in particular. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=219.92s)]
*  And if there were ever any evidence needed as to why we need a hands-on president, all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=226.92s)]
*  we have to do is think back to what happened along the Gulf Coast. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=231.84s)]
*  You know, that was a natural disaster that was turned into a national disgrace. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=236.68s)]
*  The incompetence, the indifference, the insensitivity. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=244.28s)]
*  I think the administration got embarrassed with the response that Hurricane Katrina, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=247.28s)]
*  they were embarrassed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=252.0s)]
*  An unacceptable here sadly leads to people dying and people being harmed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=253.0s)]
*  Hopefully the president, as we speak, is in, somewhere in Mississippi, I guess, right now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=258.2s)]
*  And the fact is that hopefully he will, you know, as I've said many times, synchronize [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=263.52s)]
*  his conduct with his conscience. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=269.6s)]
*  We are now more than twice that time, four-plus days after Helene touched down in Florida, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=273.56s)]
*  and neither Biden nor Harris have bothered to even fly over the wreckage. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=279.4s)]
*  Biden literally couldn't even come back from the beach and his beach house and his [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=284.28s)]
*  beach chair early. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=288.28s)]
*  Harris, she was too busy living it up with her big money donors, you know, the George [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=289.64s)]
*  Clooney-types jackass that he is in Hollywood. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, where's the same outrage from the media mob? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=298.4s)]
*  And then to make matters worse, we're now just a few hours away from a devastating strike [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=301.72s)]
*  from, you know, the East Coast and Gulf Coast dock workers, longshoremen. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=307.36s)]
*  This could literally cripple all logistics in the entire country and every single supply [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=314.6s)]
*  chain in America at a time when so many on the East Coast in particular are trying to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=320.72s)]
*  rebuild and recover from the devastation of this hurricane. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=326.86s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=331.52s)]
*  Last week, both Biden and Harris were so quick to step in front of a microphone and proudly [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=332.52s)]
*  announce $8 billion in new funding for Ukraine. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=337.0s)]
*  All told, military, humanitarian aid, they've already given $175 billion of your dollars [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=341.68s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=350.16s)]
*  Now where are the billions and billions for North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=351.52s)]
*  Florida and any other state that needs help? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=358.04s)]
*  Why are there no grand gestures for our fellow Americans in need? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  And as per usual, both Biden and Harris are now being shamed into action. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=365.44s)]
*  Biden will finally make a trip to the Southeast in coming days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=369.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=374.24s)]
*  Because Donald Trump did it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=375.24s)]
*  But no trip for Harris is planned as of now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=376.5s)]
*  I'm sure we will embarrass her into it, although we haven't been able to embarrass her into [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  doing a press conference. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=384.56s)]
*  So why does it always seem like the Biden-Harris administration is always behind the eightball [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=386.32s)]
*  during every major crisis? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=392.88s)]
*  Why is it they have zero empathy for Americans who are suffering, especially Democrats that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=394.88s)]
*  claim to have a monopoly of compassion, and when real Americans are in need, where are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=400.8s)]
*  they? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=405.96s)]
*  $8 billion for Zelensky? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=406.96s)]
*  What about the people in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=408.48s)]
*  How about helping them? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=414.48s)]
*  You know, we see this now with the hurricane and also with inflation that they said was [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  transitory for three-plus years and with the victims of illegal immigration. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=422.44s)]
*  Of course, the border is secure, the border is closed, the border is secure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=427.72s)]
*  They lied about that for three years. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=431.68s)]
*  They lied about and are proud of the botched withdrawal in Afghanistan. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=433.56s)]
*  But despite four years of nothing but feckless failed leadership, the race is still too close [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=437.92s)]
*  to call. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=444.14000000000004s)]
*  Over the weekend, we have a slight edge for Donald Trump in multiple polls. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=446.0s)]
*  Now, Atlas-Intel rated the top, along with insider advantage Trafalgar-Rasmussen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=449.64s)]
*  Well, it does show Donald Trump with a lead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Rasmussen has Trump up in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=462.0s)]
*  Trafalgar with a new poll has Donald Trump up with a two-point lead in Pennsylvania. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=466.72s)]
*  There are now more than six polls showing Donald Trump with a significant lead in Pennsylvania. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=471.56s)]
*  If Trump wins Pennsylvania, it will be very hard for Harris to get to 270 electoral votes [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=476.64s)]
*  that would be needed to win. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=483.0s)]
*  But North Carolina and Georgia, if you're in those states, it is critical for Donald [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPpcESjTr0&t=484.96s)]
