# Alan Dershowitz: This is a scary time
**Fox News:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA)
*  Joining us now, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, I'm sorry, no other way to put it, but to me, this is a very clear, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=6.04s)]
*  if you have any sense of a moral compass or moral clarity, there's no ambiguity here, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=13.32s)]
*  professor. This is repulsive, virulent anti-Semitism. It is being allowed in the halls of Congress, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=18.76s)]
*  on college universities, and Joe Biden is pressuring the victim of terrorism that they [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=26.06s)]
*  lay down their arms, not standing with Israel against the radicals that want to destroy them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=31.38s)]
*  I completely agree with you, 100%. It was absolutely outrageous for President Biden [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=38.94s)]
*  to create a moral equivalent, the same kind of moral equivalents he complained about in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=44.78s)]
*  Charlottesville, between anti-Semitic protests, which he condemns, and then he says, I also [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=48.78s)]
*  condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. What an outrageous [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=55.12s)]
*  moral comparison. Nobody could in any way support what Hamas did, yet these kids are [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=61.24s)]
*  yelling, I am Hamas. We want to repeat the rapes over and over again a thousand times. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=67.2s)]
*  And he's equating that morally with people who reasonably believe that what's happening [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=74.4s)]
*  to the Palestinians is largely the fault of Hamas. It's absolutely outrageous, which [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=80.16s)]
*  is why I wrote a column today arguing that what is happening on college campuses today [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=85.84s)]
*  may be worse than what happened on January 6th, may be worse than what happened in Charlottesville, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=90.82s)]
*  and we are not concerned nearly as much about it as we were about January 6th. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  January 6th involved a relatively small number of people, low thousands. They aren't people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  who are going to be our future leaders. Charlottesville didn't involve our future leaders. What's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=109.24s)]
*  going on on college campuses today, we are Hamas, means our future leaders, the people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=114.32s)]
*  who will be in the editorial rooms of the New York Times, on CNN, in Goldman Sachs, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=120.0s)]
*  in law firms, running for Congress. That's why it's more dangerous what's going on today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And thank you, Bob Kraft, for cutting off all your aid to Columbia. I've done the same [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't have your money, with Harvard, with Yale. Nobody should contribute to these ivy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=136.76s)]
*  league cesspools, which have become incubators for the worst form of anti-Jewish racism that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=142.12s)]
*  I've known in my 85 years of life. This is a scary time. Yes, it is in some ways like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=148.92s)]
*  1933 in Germany, but in other ways it's not, because the Jews have Israel to defend it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=156.64s)]
*  And as long as the Jews have Israel, and Israel has weapons, including nuclear weapons, we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=162.6s)]
*  won't see a repeat of 1941 and 1942. But we will see a repeat of 1933 and 34, where college [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=168.0s)]
*  students at the University of Munich and at the University of Berlin brought Hitler to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  power, brought Pol Pot to power, brought Castro to power. Young 23-year-olds can be among [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=181.84s)]
*  the most evil and dangerous people in the world, and we're seeing it happening at Columbia [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  and NYU and Yale today. Shame on the presidents who have facilitated and allowed this kind [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=194.68s)]
*  of bigotry to occur in our universities. Let me go to you, Mike Huckabee, the protesters. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=201.96s)]
*  We are Hamas, long live Hamas. And by the way, this is not an attack on Islam. This [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=209.52s)]
*  is an attack on radical Islamists. We make a distinction on this program. Literally screaming [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=215.12s)]
*  Jews, Jews, go back to Poland. Wow. Did you ever think, Mike Huckabee, we'd be reporting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=221.0s)]
*  this and talking about this in our lifetime? Because I didn't. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=227.88s)]
*  No, I prayed to God we never would. And I hope that a lot of people can start understanding [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=232.16s)]
*  there's a difference between educated people and smart people. A lot of these college kids [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=237.84s)]
*  are educated, but they're not real smart. They don't have a clue about what the Jews [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=242.16s)]
*  have gone through. They don't have a clue about Israel. They don't have a clue about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=246.64s)]
*  what happened October 7th and the outright butchery of women and the violent rape in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=250.88s)]
*  front of their own families. You know, one of the horrors of the Holocaust was that a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=256.84s)]
*  whole lot of other people looked the other way and pretended it wasn't going on. There [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=262.24s)]
*  were only a handful of Christians like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who ended up being a martyr for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=266.52s)]
*  standing against the Nazis. But I hope in this particular situation that every Christian [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=271.7s)]
*  will stand with our Jewish friends and we will say with them, never again. This should [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  never happen and it shouldn't be led on college campuses. You know, there's no consequences [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  for this ridiculous behavior of these college students and the faculty. And that's part [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=289.68s)]
*  of the problem. Sean, I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1957 at Central High School, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=296.26s)]
*  nine black students were told they couldn't go into the school. And it was President Eisenhower [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=302.02s)]
*  who federalized the National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne in and said, yes, you will [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=308.34s)]
*  go to school and stood against the mobs. Why won't Joe Biden show some leadership and stand [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=313.82s)]
*  against the mobs? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=320.02s)]
*  I stand with you, Governor, by the way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=322.26s)]
*  Because he wants their vote. That's why. He wants their vote in Michigan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=324.26s)]
*  He wants their vote. But I say, Governor Huckabee, I will say this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=327.26s)]
*  Because he wants their vote in Michigan. But. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=331.26s)]
*  At what price, Professor? And I'll say this. Governor Huckabee, you're right. Every Christian, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=333.26s)]
*  and I am a Christian, should be standing in solidarity with Israel at this time. And I'll [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=338.26s)]
*  add one other thing. And America, every American should be standing with them because this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=344.26s)]
*  is their 9-11. And based on population, it was a greater percentage of their population [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=350.26s)]
*  was murdered on October 7th. Thank you both. Professor, thank you. Governor Huckabee, thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH8UbifyIA&t=357.26s)]
