# Nikki Haley: This all started with the debacle in Afghanistan
**Fox News:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE)
*  All right, Joe Biden's weakness on the world stage now is making America less safe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, Iran, they issued a warning on Thursday that a proposed U.S.-backed task force to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  protect ships in the Red Sea would cause, quote, an extraordinary problems in the region. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=11.3s)]
*  Now, the latest threat comes after the U.S. destroyer had to shoot down yet another Houthi [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  drone over the Red Sea yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And again, we ask a simple question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=25.72s)]
*  Is Joe Biden ever, ever going to forcefully respond to unprovoked attacks like these? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Now, given his disastrous track record, I don't think I'd hold my breath. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=34.72s)]
*  Anyway, meanwhile, in the administration's latest show of wavering support for Israel, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=38.64s)]
*  according to Axios, all-National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is now telling Israeli [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=43.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu that the, quote, high-intensity phase of the Gaza war needs [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=48.8s)]
*  to end within weeks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=54.699999999999996s)]
*  However, the Biden administration, they are pushing back on the report, saying Sullivan [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=56.26s)]
*  did not give a timeline. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  And yet another report saying Vice President Kamala Harris is pushing the White House to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=62.62s)]
*  be more sympathetic to the Palestinians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=66.9s)]
*  Here with reaction, 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=70.14s)]
*  You know, maybe I'm old-fashioned governor, ambassador, but I will tell you, if you're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=73.34s)]
*  going to be involved in any conflict or any war, you should have one aim. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=80.1s)]
*  I will quote Winston Churchill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=84.46s)]
*  Victory, victory at all costs against a monstrous tyranny. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't that fit here? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  Why would Joe Biden be lecturing Israel on how to fight and win their war? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=92.94s)]
*  For them, it's a war of survival. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=98.02s)]
*  Sean, this is why none of our enemies fear us, is because they see exactly what Biden [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=99.82s)]
*  does. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=106.41999999999999s)]
*  He did this with Ukraine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  Now he's doing it with Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=108.41999999999999s)]
*  Either you're a friend or you're not. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=109.41999999999999s)]
*  And why are you taking the side of Hamas as opposed to Israel? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=111.82s)]
*  If you say you're going to be with Israel and support Israel, then do that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=116.1s)]
*  But you don't start drawing conditions on what they can and can't do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=119.94s)]
*  This was a country that fell to her knees with the worst attacks since the Holocaust. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  And now they're trying to eliminate Hamas, the ones that did this, which by the way should [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  be personal for America, because 33 Americans were butchered on that day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  We've got American hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=139.66s)]
*  Let them finish the job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=141.62s)]
*  Let them finish Hamas once and for all. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=143.22s)]
*  Stop telling them what they can and can't do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=145.74s)]
*  And stop worrying about whether Hamas and the people of Gaza are okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=148.1s)]
*  And start worrying about what are we really going to do to protect the security of Israel, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  which by the way, protects the security of America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=156.86s)]
*  All right, maybe it's me, but I would say if Israel wants to have full victory, they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  need to prevent Gaza from ever again being a launching pad for rockets into their neighboring [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=165.06s)]
*  cities. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=172.06s)]
*  I think victory has to be defined by ending that network of terror tunnels. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=173.06s)]
*  Victory has to be defined by preventing Lebanon and Hezbollah from firing missiles using Lebanon [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=178.66s)]
*  as a launching pad into Israel, firing rockets and missiles. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=185.18s)]
*  And I would also say if they want full victory, somebody's going to have to at some point [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=189.22s)]
*  deal with Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=193.3s)]
*  The way I would deal with Iran, nobody's asking my opinion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  I would take out every refinery they have that would cut back on their money supply. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=197.66s)]
*  And if possible, somebody at some point, they better take out those nuclear sites before [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=202.7s)]
*  Iran married with their sick ideology were ever to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=208.34s)]
*  Would you agree with that? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=212.78s)]
*  Sean, I mean, you have to look at the fact that Iran decided years ago, and they've been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=213.78s)]
*  very good at it, at using their proxies rather than doing things themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=219.58s)]
*  There would be no Houthis without Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  There would not be Hamas without Iran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=226.14s)]
*  There would not be Hezbollah without Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=228.61999999999998s)]
*  So they're using their proxies to do their dirty work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  But if we really want to do something, why doesn't Joe Biden go back and put the sanctions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  down on Iran that were already there? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=239.2s)]
*  Why are you letting billions of dollars flow to Iran from China, who's importing all of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=242.0s)]
*  their oil? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  Why are you continuing to talk about an Iran deal when all that does is show weakness? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=247.48s)]
*  And why not go after those in Syria and Iraq that continue to hit our military men and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=253.4s)]
*  women, hit their infrastructure in Syria and Iraq, give them one big punch, and they will [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=257.32s)]
*  step back? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=262.72s)]
*  But right now, they don't fear us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=264.0s)]
*  And that all started with the debacle in Afghanistan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=266.66s)]
*  It went on with Ukraine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you see what happened there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=271.12s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the fact that Hamas invaded Israel on Putin's birthday, that was [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=273.0s)]
*  a gift to Putin. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=279.66s)]
*  There's a reason he is the happiest man in the world, because what happened? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=281.32s)]
*  Basically, U.S. and the West took their eyes off of Ukraine and put their eyes on Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=285.76s)]
*  And so now Putin's hoping this is the moment he can take Ukraine and go into Poland and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=292.08s)]
*  the Baltics, and then we are at war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=296.36s)]
*  This is about preventing war. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=298.52s)]
*  And Biden is failing on the job miserably and making the world less safe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=300.2s)]
*  I would like to see America, and I know you were the U.N. ambassador. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=304.84s)]
*  I don't trust these globalist organizations anymore. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  Historically, they have been anti-American and they have been anti-Semitic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=313.04s)]
*  I talked to you about this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't trust the World Health Organization. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=317.56s)]
*  They were basically propagandists for China on the issue of COVID. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=320.24s)]
*  I don't trust the WEF. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=325.6s)]
*  I don't trust the Paris Accords that we're a part of. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  And I feel like any time we get involved in these globalist organizations, it ends up [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=330.68s)]
*  badly for the U.S. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=335.56s)]
*  And we end up paying billions and billions of dollars that we can't afford. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  Does this need to stop? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=342.12s)]
*  Should America now retreat from some of these globalist organizations? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=343.28s)]
*  Yes, and we need to go and show exactly what we mean when we do that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  It's the reason that we got out of the Paris Climate Agreement when I was at the U.N. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=354.12s)]
*  It's the reason we got out of the Human Rights Council. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  It's the reason we stopped any taxpayer dollars going to the Palestinian refugee [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=359.52s)]
*  organization. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=364.2s)]
*  We absolutely should get out of the World Health Organization. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=365.04s)]
*  And anything that the U.N. is doing, look at how they failed at looking at the human [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=368.44s)]
*  rights abuses of what has happened to the women on October 7th. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=373.36s)]
*  They're nowhere to be found. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  They continue to show themselves to be a farce. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=379.72s)]
*  We should defund the U.N. as much as possible and let them know that until they start to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=382.24s)]
*  become legitimate, we're not going to sit there and put any more money into it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=387.24s)]
*  Because right now what's happening is China's winning with these organizations, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=392.12s)]
*  Russia's winning with these organizations, and no one is putting a stop to what they're [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=395.8s)]
*  doing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=399.64s)]
*  It's because they smell weakness. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=400.64s)]
*  It's because they smell blood. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  America has lost its footing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=404.08s)]
*  We can get it back. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=405.36s)]
*  We can get it back. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=406.76s)]
*  But it comes with American strength. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  American strength always prevents wars and gets the world to be more at peace. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=410.52s)]
*  We've got to go back to that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=415.32s)]
*  Last question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=416.76s)]
*  Governor DeSantis was on this program last night. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=417.76s)]
*  He wants to debate you one on one right here on this program. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=419.78s)]
*  What would be your answer, Bea? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=423.32s)]
*  Well, I've debated him four times. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=425.32s)]
*  I love debates. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=427.85999999999996s)]
*  I have no issue with that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  But quite honestly, Sean, the person I want to debate is Donald Trump. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  If you can get him on your show, that's who I want to debate. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=433.46s)]
*  That's who we're looking at. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  That's who's, you know, we're second place in Iowa, second place in New Hampshire, second [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  place in South Carolina. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=441.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's the one we're looking in the windshield. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's the one that I think needs to get up on the debate stage. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  I think you'd be great at it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=447.58s)]
*  I welcome you to try and get that together. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=448.98s)]
*  But that's our focus right now, is getting Donald Trump on a debate stage. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=451.78s)]
*  Any debate stage that does not have Chris Christie on it is one that I'll approve of. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=454.58s)]
*  I'll put it that way. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=458.82s)]
*  Anyway, Nikki Haley, thank you for being with us. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=459.82s)]
