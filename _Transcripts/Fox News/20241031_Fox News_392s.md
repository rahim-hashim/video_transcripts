# Newt Gingrich: Kamala Harris is beginning to realize ‘she’s going to lose’
**Fox News:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg)
*  All right, joining us now, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=0.0s)]
*  I know I'm going to see a smile on your face. What is your reaction to this, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=4.4s)]
*  this every surrogate out there? Bill Clinton, Mark Cuban, Stacey Abrams, Barack Obama, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=7.92s)]
*  Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, not exactly helpful. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, and first of all, it's very tough to follow Laura Trump, who's doing an amazing job [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=21.84s)]
*  at the Republican National Committees. But look, what you're watching is sort of like [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=28.24s)]
*  Custer's Last Stand. I mean, these folks are all on the verge of a disaster. They're running in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  circles. They're saying things that are hysterical, untrue, unbelievable. And if you watched [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=40.08s)]
*  Kamala earlier today, she's just plain getting exhausted. She's never campaigned. She's never [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  had to win anything. It's all been given to her. And now suddenly in the last week, she's in, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=54.24s)]
*  I suspect being to realize she's going to lose. And you're going to see more and more desperation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  from now through next Tuesday, as it really sinks in that this is over. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=67.6s)]
*  Donald J. Trump's going to be the next president. Kamala Harris is going to lose. And I assume either [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=73.28s)]
*  go back to San Francisco or maybe join the Obamas on some very fancy island. But the fact is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=79.36s)]
*  that I think you're going to see a desperation. I also believe personally, and I can't prove this, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=88.8s)]
*  but I believe that at some point about three weeks ago, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=94.32s)]
*  Jill and Joe Biden looked at each other and said, you know, if Joe's the only person to ever beat [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump, that's kind of an interesting legacy. And for the last couple of weeks, he has undercut her [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=104.8s)]
*  over and over. And think about that scene on the ellipse. 70,000 people, the vice president [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=111.36s)]
*  right in front of the White House. Do you see the president? Is he invited? Is he given dignity? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=118.8s)]
*  Is he a guest? No, he's hidden. You don't think Joe Biden resented that? And so he says, oh, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  let me say something that will get people to pay attention, like garbage. So he drowns [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=132.16s)]
*  her entire event. And we think that he did this by accident. I don't. I think it was deliberate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=137.44s)]
*  You know, you know. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=143.92s)]
*  And I think it worked. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=144.24s)]
*  To go and lean Julia Roberts and cut an ad about women lying to their husbands, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  that it's OK, followed up by her speech this week where she flat out lied and said, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to have a national abortion ban when he has said many times [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=160.96s)]
*  the exact opposite. He's going to limit access to birth control. The exact opposite is true, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  that he doesn't support, he'll stop IVF treatment. The exact opposite is true. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=173.44s)]
*  Or have Hollywood elitist jackass. You know, really? I'm going to look for what manliness [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=178.08s)]
*  looks like to George Clooney, the Hollywood jackass spoiled elitist. No, thank you. He's no John [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=184.72s)]
*  Wayne. Look, let me go out on the limb for a second as a historian. These people are dishonest. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=192.08s)]
*  They're relentlessly, routinely dishonest at every level. And so for them to tell people to lie [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=200.16s)]
*  is just one further example of the depth of their corruption. I mean, how do you run a country where [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=208.16s)]
*  you're walking around saying wives should lie to their husbands, husbands should lie to their wives? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=214.0s)]
*  I mean, what kind of a totally amoral, corrupt, sick system have the Democrats developed? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=219.92s)]
*  If you think about it at that level, it is astonishing the decay. This is, frankly, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=227.2s)]
*  why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't switch parties, but was campaigning Sunday with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=233.36s)]
*  Donald Trump, because the party of John F. Kennedy, the party of Robert Kennedy, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=239.2s)]
*  it's gone. I mean, instead of having dignity and patriotism and a sense of morality, these are really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=244.16s)]
*  sick people. And the more you watch them to say, oh, why don't you lie to your husband, as a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=250.8s)]
*  publicly advocated ad, that is sick. And I think we ought to have the courage to say, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=257.68s)]
*  this is a sick, dishonest party. You know, to demonize and denigrate African Americans the way [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=263.84s)]
*  Stacey Abrams and Barack Obama, you know, I thought they wanted African American men to vote for them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=272.64s)]
*  Insulting them is not the best strategy, in my view. Telling women, if they're trying to target [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=279.76s)]
*  women voters, lying to your husband, that message is not exactly a winning message, or lying about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=285.44s)]
*  abortion and contraception and IVF. You know, it's all to scare them, which tells me they must be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  scared that their internal numbers show that they're not doing as well as they want with those [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  particular demographics, considering they're the identity politics party. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  Look, let me just pose a simple question that I hope some reporter will ask Stacey Abrams, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  who's never gotten over, by the way, losing and has lost, and it's over. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=316.8s)]
*  Talk about election deniers. How can she say the young black men who vote for Trump [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=321.04s)]
*  are racist? I just want to understand, how do you say to a young black male, you're a racist? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=328.16s)]
*  I have no idea what she's saying, except that she's learned a set of code words, and she thinks if [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=336.24s)]
*  she repeats them like Pablum, that somehow they'll have meaning. I mean, it's a little [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=343.12s)]
*  bit like watching some Walt Disney film about a wizard or something. You know, how can you be a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  young black male and be a racist? This is just Stacey Abrams personifying the collapse and the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=352.64s)]
*  insanity of the modern democratic party. You've given her a break. She also said that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=359.52s)]
*  African American men are sexist. She said both, so let's be clear. I didn't say they couldn't be [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=365.2s)]
*  sexist, but they sure can't be racist. I have no clue. I don't think she has a clue what she's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=371.28s)]
*  saying. I appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXLY14cxIpg&t=378.08s)]
