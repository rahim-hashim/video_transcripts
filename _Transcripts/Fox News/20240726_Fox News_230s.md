# Sen. Tim Scott: Kamala is looking for ‘power and votes’
**Fox News:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8)
*  Anyway, here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I kind of get—I believe the Kamala Harris that supported students speaking their [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=3.88s)]
*  truth when they were showing support after the worst terror attack in Israel's history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=10.58s)]
*  I think it spoke volumes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=16.86s)]
*  I think actions are louder than words. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=19.1s)]
*  She chose not to be at this joint session yesterday with the prime minister, who I thought [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=22.2s)]
*  gave a Churchillian speech. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=27.6s)]
*  That to me means a lot more than words that somebody wrote for her to put out just to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  try to put the controversy to rest. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=34.96s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're 100 percent right once again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  There's no doubt that her snubbing Prime Minister Netanyahu in the most amazing speech [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  I've heard all year long is absolutely abdication of her responsibility as vice president, but [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=46.16s)]
*  more importantly, it signals a step to the left. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=53.8s)]
*  I didn't know that you could go further to the left than Joe Biden, but Kamala Harris [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  never disappoints when it comes going left. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  She is more aggressive against Israel than Joe Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=66.56s)]
*  She's more pro-Palestinian and anti-Semitic as it relates to the wing of her party that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=72.0s)]
*  leads the conversation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=79.0s)]
*  She is willing to appease those in her party. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=80.76s)]
*  That is disgusting, devastating and will ring hollow to those of us who know you have to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=84.28s)]
*  be loyal to your allies so that you can be lethal to your adversaries. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=90.56s)]
*  She is looking for power and votes not doing the right thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  I got to say, the contrast in leadership, listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu talk [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  about our enemies are your enemies and therefore your victory, our victory will be your victory. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=106.96s)]
*  What did Kamala Harris say? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=115.16s)]
*  Nothing, because she wasn't there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  She can't stand up to students who are saying genocide, Jewish genocide. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  She says, as you've already said, speak your truth, speak your truth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=129.92s)]
*  John 831 and 32 tells us that to know the truth sets you free. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=130.92s)]
*  To speak a lie oppresses you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  There are so many people oppressed in Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=142.6s)]
*  So, she's scored to the left of Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=143.6s)]
*  Alright, we all know that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=146.48s)]
*  But here's my question. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  We watched what happened in Israel on October 7th. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=150.04s)]
*  It would have been the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans in a day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=153.48s)]
*  We lost 2,977 and we've lost many lives thereafter from 9-11 related illnesses. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=158.0s)]
*  And 40,000 dead Americans if you extrapolate our population. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  And my question is, what part of murder, rape, beheading, torture and kidnapping do these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=170.52s)]
*  people on the left not care about, not understand, and why wouldn't they support Israel's right [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=178.08s)]
*  to win their war against a group that is, that has in their charter a pledge to destroy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel and as Prime Minister Netanyahu said, this is civilization versus barbarism. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=190.16s)]
*  Why wouldn't Joe and Kamala support their right to win that war? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, bottom line is simply this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  They want power not to protect people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  It is a very simple fact. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=206.28s)]
*  We look at the October 7th tragedy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  We know you have to stand the side of justice. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=210.68s)]
*  She chose to sit down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw3K6-zpW8&t=216.76000000000002s)]
