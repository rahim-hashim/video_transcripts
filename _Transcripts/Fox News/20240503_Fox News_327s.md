# This is a crisis across higher education: Rep. Elise Stefanik
**Fox News:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U)
*  With the latest House Republican Conference chair, Elise Stefanik, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, you are, I would say, the foremost voice on this issue. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=2.92s)]
*  You grilled three presidents of universities, two of which had to resign in the aftermath. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=7.8s)]
*  You're leading these probes, House Republicans, and we just heard Alexis talk about outside agitators. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=12.32s)]
*  John Kirby said he can't find evidence of bad actors. We brought it for him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=17.56s)]
*  Let's pull it up. I want to bring this up for you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=21.84s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin, non-student participation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=24.32s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams, outside agitators, Northeastern, University of Texas, University of Florida, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=26.92s)]
*  all pointing to outside agitators. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=32.24s)]
*  Do you have any idea who these outside agitators are? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=34.36s)]
*  Do you think you can find out? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=37.2s)]
*  Absolutely, and that's going to be part of this House Republican-wide probe, Kayleigh. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=40.68s)]
*  That's why it's so important that we've expanded this investigation, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=44.36s)]
*  because it's not just oversight of U.S. taxpayer dollars to these institutions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=47.6s)]
*  It's student visas for foreign students who are harassing Jewish students, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=51.8s)]
*  who are attacking Jewish students on campus. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=57.24s)]
*  The outside agitators piece, absolutely, we need to work with our law enforcement to get to the bottom of it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=59.8s)]
*  and we are committed to doing so. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=65.12s)]
*  Take Columbia. NYPD put out data that over 40 percent of the individuals were outside and unaffiliated with Columbia. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=67.12s)]
*  Now you still have Columbia professors and Columbia students, and they need to be expelled. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=74.12s)]
*  But that's why these investigations are so important. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=78.36s)]
*  And as we saw, the hearing where my questions went viral and the answers, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=81.08s)]
*  the morally bankrupt answers from the presidents of Penn and Harvard, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=85.4s)]
*  that set off a real crisis across higher education that has been brewing for a very long time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=88.76s)]
*  And it's House Republicans that are going to lead to protect Jewish students [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=95.56s)]
*  and specifically condemn anti-Semitism and get rid of this woke radicalization. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  And you know who has been so silent? Joe Biden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=103.88s)]
*  He has, and it's appalling. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=107.2s)]
*  Congresswoman, you had another moment, and this was with the president of Columbia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=109.04s)]
*  You asked her about a professor. His name is Professor Joseph Massad. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=113.28s)]
*  Joseph Massad called the October 7th attacks. That's where babies were slaughtered. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  He called these attacks awesome. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  I want to play the sound of when you grilled the professor of Columbia [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  about if there were any repercussions for this professor. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  So let me be clear, president, that he was spoken to. Who spoke with him? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=132.24s)]
*  He was spoken to by his head of department and his dean. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  And what was he told? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=141.76s)]
*  I was not in those conversations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  I think he was told that language was unacceptable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  What was he told? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=148.68s)]
*  That that language was unacceptable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  And were there any other enforcement actions taken? Any other disciplinary actions taken? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=151.88s)]
*  In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  Does he need to repeat stating that the massacre of Israeli civilians was awesome? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=161.92s)]
*  Does he need to repeat his participation in an unauthorized pro-Hamas demonstration? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=167.48s)]
*  It sounds like what she said is he praised a terrorist attack and just got a stern talking to. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=178.44s)]
*  It's right. And what's worth worse, Kayleigh, is that she testified that he was under investigation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=181.28s)]
*  There were two professors that are pro-Hamas professors that I asked about, and she said both were under investigation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  It turns out that those professors then said to The New York Times the day after the hearing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  that there was no investigation, that they were not removed from the classroom, that they were not removed as academic chair. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=197.36s)]
*  So this is a real legal issue for Manu Shafik, who is president of Columbia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=202.96s)]
*  You can't lie to Congress. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=207.44000000000003s)]
*  That's a federal offense. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  And that's why the document requests are so incredibly important to make sure that we subpoena all the documents and lack thereof [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  if there were no investigations, which we now know there were not. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  So there is a lot more here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=221.24s)]
*  I think the Columbia strategy was to say whatever they had to say in the hearing to try to avoid the fate of the president's former presidents of Penn and Harvard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  But the problem with that, Kayleigh, is there was no action to back it up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=231.88s)]
*  Columbia had not taken adequate action to hold those pro-Hamas professors account by suspending them and expelling them from campus, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=234.68s)]
*  to hold the students account by expelling them to campus and to protect Jewish students. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=243.04s)]
*  They failed on all those counts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=247.0s)]
*  I would love to see Professor Shafik's text messages. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=248.92s)]
*  That'd be really revealing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  Should she step aside based on just the public evidence you've seen? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  Of course. I was the first member to call for her resignation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  It's clear that it's out of control at Columbia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=260.84s)]
*  Just look at the fact that they are negotiating. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  She negotiated. She set these deadlines for when the pro-Hamas encampment needed to leave and that she allowed these agitators to go beyond that deadline. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=266.0s)]
*  There has been no enforcement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=274.84s)]
*  And what's most important here is Jewish students have not been protected on Columbia's campus. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=276.24s)]
*  And it is required by Title VI, the executive order that you remember that President Trump put into place that protects Jewish students. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=281.32s)]
*  They have failed at Columbia to follow the law. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  And Joe Biden's Department of Education has failed to hold them accountable. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=291.12s)]
*  That's why it's been so incredibly important that House Republicans have stepped in in our oversight capacity as good stewards of taxpayer dollars, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=295.12s)]
*  but also making sure that we are reigning in these out-of-control, woke higher ed institutions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=302.44s)]
*  And I will continue to lead this fight. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=307.24s)]
*  Congresswoman Stefanik, you haven't just led. You haven't just gotten answers. You've gotten results. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=309.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyg1XlaF1U&t=314.15999999999997s)]
