# Sean Hannity: This is disgraceful
**Fox News:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg)
*  We do begin tonight with a Manhattan in a Manhattan courtroom where justice is not being served at all in the name of quote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=0.0s)]
*  Equity well district attorney Alvin Bragg announced what was a long list of serious crimes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=7.96s)]
*  He says he'll never prosecute including trespassing resisting arrest [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=13.32s)]
*  prostitution certain illicit drug deals of the violent crimes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=18.8s)]
*  Well Bragg is willing to prosecute the few he rarely requests bail the no bail law stands letting offenders [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=23.76s)]
*  Back on the streets almost immediately. He saw it no bail for example for that 16 year old caught on video [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=30.68s)]
*  Viciously beating and New York police officer and take a look at your screen [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=38.08s)]
*  There was also no bail required for the illegal immigrants who attacked the NYPD right there beating kicking in Times Square [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=42.46s)]
*  Another offender who was previously convicted of rape and robbery was arrested 33 times in three months [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=51.04s)]
*  But da Alvin Bragg didn't see the need for any bail [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=57.76s)]
*  During any of those 33 arrests in his first year Bragg downgraded almost 60% of all felonies to misdemeanors [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Now a person who participated in the murder of a US Army vet was actually released from prison after only 14 months behind bars [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=69.8s)]
*  Thanks, of course to a sweetheart deal from Alvin Bragg 14 months for an alleged murderer [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=78.72s)]
*  in the state of New York, but now Donald Trump Trump is facing a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  136 years behind bars for a document a bookkeeping error [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=90.68s)]
*  Allegedly mislabeled and some other charge that they really haven't identified yet a misdemeanor charge [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  From almost a decade ago well past the statute of limitations [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  That Bragg somehow converted into multiple felonies on the federal level now this from a prosecutor who routinely [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=106.26s)]
*  Downgrades violent crimes into misdemeanors that make any sense to you and we're just supposed to act like oh, this is business as usual [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=113.3s)]
*  That there's nothing suspicious nothing unethical that's going on in the state of New York [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  This is nothing but a kangaroo court a political hit job in the middle of an election [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=125.86s)]
*  It's featuring a Democratic prosecutor another lead prosecutor who left his very prominent role at Joe Biden's DOJ [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=130.9s)]
*  He was third in line just to prosecute this little old case against Joe Biden's opponent in the general election [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=139.46s)]
*  In New York and that would be Donald Trump and let's not forget a judge who donated to Joe Biden [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=146.3s)]
*  Can't make all this up a jury pool comprised of people who voted nine to one against Donald Trump in the 2020 election [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=152.02s)]
*  Allegations that there might be familiar benefit in terms of the judges family [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=160.22s)]
*  He should have recused himself and today another disgraceful chapter in this kangaroo court [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=165.3s)]
*  Here she was porn star Stormy Daniels took the stand Stormy Stormy Stormy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=170.74s)]
*  For no apparent reason other than to embarrass Donald Donald Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=176.1s)]
*  She answered questions from another prosecutor who donated to Joe Biden in 2020 and her testimony was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=180.54s)]
*  Superfluous and irrelevant it was immaterial it was filled with salacious graphic details [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=187.62s)]
*  Jokes that weren't particularly funny that were gratuitous and inappropriate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=193.62s)]
*  Even MSDNC even they were perplexed take a look [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=198.5s)]
*  We're talking about a very very colorful witness who detailed kinds of events and just [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=203.46s)]
*  You know efforts and ways of being that I think for the jury was were fairly foreign [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=211.18s)]
*  She spoke very quickly nervously. She told a lot of jokes and not all of them landed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=217.46s)]
*  I haven't seen Mayor Chun this in this trial be so sort of irritated and it came across [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  I think as being irritated with her level of detail [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  That's something if you're the DA you're worried about because you don't want them to think that he the judge is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  Actually on displeased in any way with the witness [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=241.22s)]
*  Her testimony was so bad and unnecessarily salacious and irrelevant that Trump's defense attorneys moved for a mistrial [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=245.38s)]
*  Naturally that motion was denied by the Biden donor judge now judge Mershon should be embarrassed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=253.34s)]
*  His courtroom is a joke a political circus. It's filled to the brim with clowns and keep in mind [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=259.34s)]
*  This is the same stormy Daniels member [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  She signed a 2018 letter denying any affair with Donald Trump over the past few weeks [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=267.26s)]
*  I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=274.06s)]
*  I had with Donald Trump many many years ago [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=279.3s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  2006 2011 [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=288.34000000000003s)]

*  2018 I am NOT denying this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=294.42s)]
*  Affair because I was paid quote hush money as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=297.26s)]
*  I am denying this affair because it never happened [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=303.22s)]
*  I will have no further comment on the matter. Of course her story has now changed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=306.58s)]
*  She says she signed a non-disclosure [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=311.82s)]
*  Agreement only because she felt threatened the prosecution's other star witness that's convicted liar [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=314.42s)]
*  Michael Cohen also tells an ever-evolving story [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=320.58s)]
*  but none of that really matters because so-called hush money payments or [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=323.9s)]
*  NDAs are perfectly legal and this case is about the way a document involving the alleged NDA [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=328.58s)]
*  Was labeled eight years ago, but you wouldn't know it listening to the prosecution [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=335.38s)]
*  Also about whether or not it has anything to do with an uncharged federal election crime that album [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=340.26s)]

*  This is what the weaponization of justice in America looks like [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  This is what shredding our sacred constitution looks like [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=361.0s)]
*  Of course the Democratic activists pretending to be a judge is [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=366.04s)]
*  Chomping at the bit to lock up Donald Trump with or without a guilty verdict his on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=370.32s)]
*  Constitutional gag order well bars Trump from defending himself [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=376.08s)]
*  Doesn't stop the other side from saying and doing anything they want even as witnesses and our smearing Trump all over social media and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=379.88s)]
*  on conspiracy channels like MSDNC the judge has already fined Trump thousands of dollars for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=387.88s)]
*  Exercising what our First Amendment rights and is now threatening to send him to prison fellow Democrat, New York City mayor [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=394.91999999999996s)]

*  This is a disgusting abuse of power from a judge and state prosecutors and everyone else in Biden's orbit [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhLir0WsTg&t=409.08000000000004s)]
