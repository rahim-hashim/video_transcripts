# Kayleigh McEnany: Biden hasn't been making 'great strides' in polling
**Fox News:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA)
*  Good evening and welcome to this special edition of Hannity. I'm Kayleigh McEnany and for Sean, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=7.24s)]
*  Moments ago, President Joe Biden wrapped up a high stakes exclusive interview with ABC [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=11.72s)]
*  News anchor George Stephanopoulos. Now this interview could determine the future of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=17.86s)]
*  presidency and the future of the country. It's been widely viewed as the last opportunity [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=22.16s)]
*  for Biden to drown out the many voices, governors, senators, congressmen, either questioning his [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=28.52s)]
*  capacity behind the scenes or in some cases outright with their name on it. He's trying to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  prove he's healthy. He's mentally capable enough to serve as president. It was also his first on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=40.4s)]
*  camera scripted opportunity to address his debate performance to a national audience. Here's what he [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=47.16s)]
*  had to say. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=53.4s)]
*  Was this a bad episode? Were the sign of a more serious condition? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=54.72s)]
*  It's a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. What were you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=59.82s)]
*  experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going? Yeah, look, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=65.88s)]
*  the whole way I prepared, nobody's fault, mine. Nobody's fault but mine. I prepared what I [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=73.92s)]
*  usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders or the National Security [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=81.76s)]
*  Council for explicit detail. And I realized about part way through that, you know, all I quoted [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  the New York Times had me down at 10 points before the debate, nine now or whatever the hell it is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=95.84s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that when I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't, I mean, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  the way the debate ran, not my fault. Nobody else's fault. No one else's fault. But it seemed like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=110.52s)]
*  you were having trouble from the first question in even before he spoke. Well, I just had a bad night. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=116.2s)]
*  Now you heard Biden there mentioned polling from the New York Times. He suggested that he gained a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=125.4s)]
*  point, but Biden hasn't been making great strides in polling. Who is telling him this? He did not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=130.2s)]
*  gain one point. In fact, he lost three in the New York Times Sienna poll among likely voters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=136.28s)]
*  Trump now leads Biden 49 to 43. And that is the largest lead that Trump has had in this poll since [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=141.56s)]
*  since 2015. Well, next up, Biden was asked directly whether he'd be willing to take a cognitive exam. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=148.04s)]
*  Here's what he said. Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=156.28s)]
*  included neurological and cognitive tests and release the results to the American people? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=161.16s)]
*  Look, I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=166.6s)]
*  you know, not only am I campaigning, but I'm running the world. And that's not how it sounds [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=174.68s)]
*  like hyperbole, but we are the central nation in the world. I don't know if I was right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=179.0s)]
*  He was asked four times whether he would take a cognitive test. Four times he deflected. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, this interview was also an opportunity for him to lay out his vision for his second term [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=191.88s)]
*  for the American people. He's been unable to do that so far and he was given a chance tonight, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  but it fell flat. This next term, I'm going to make sure we have a straightened out the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  tax system. I'm going to make sure we're in a situation where we have health care for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  all people. We're in a position where we have child care and elder care free up and all these things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=212.76s)]
*  The early reactions were not good. And even from some Democrats, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=222.44s)]
*  here's what David Axelrod said earlier on CNN after the first clip was released. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=225.8s)]
*  And watching that interview, I found it poignant. I don't know that it's going to relieve anyone [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=232.36s)]
*  to hear the president explain what happened. And, you know, it seemed a little disjointed as it, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=238.12s)]
*  you know, not as disjointed as he was in the debate, but it still didn't seem [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=249.4s)]
*  like he had completely grasped what happened and why. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=253.0s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xufp6JvWtA&t=268.12s)]
