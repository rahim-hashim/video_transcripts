# Brooke Goldstein: This is lawlessness
**Fox News:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc)
*  All right, last night, a rallying supporting Kamala Harris in New York City turned to total [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=0.0s)]
*  chaos after being infiltrated by pro-Palestinian, in some cases pro-Hamas protesters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=4.38s)]
*  Now, several demonstrators, they were removed from the rally, but they then went on to storm [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=10.36s)]
*  the restaurant where an afterparty was being held. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=15.84s)]
*  You can see it right there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=18.12s)]
*  Now, take a look at your screen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=19.64s)]
*  The agitators proceeded to set off smoke bombs in the street, spar with police. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=21.16s)]
*  But this is just a fraction of what we are expecting to see at the DNC next week, a pro-Palestinian [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=26.08s)]
*  group and some Hamas supporters saying they are bringing tens of thousands of protesters [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=32.68s)]
*  to what they are calling the march on the DNC 2024. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=38.8s)]
*  All of Kamala and Tim Wall's friends will come. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Wall's, well, can even open up his hotel window. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=46.64s)]
*  Maybe he'll be able to smell burning rubber from the riots, if they occur. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And tonight, former President Trump continues to make his support for Israel very clear [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=54.92s)]
*  and unambiguous. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=59.28s)]
*  He spoke at a fighting anti-Semitism event in New Jersey. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=64.84s)]
*  We're here tonight because we believe that this vicious outbreak of militant anti-Semitism [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=65.84s)]
*  is very militant. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=72.4s)]
*  It must be given no quarter, no safe harbor, no place in a civilized society. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=73.4s)]
*  We must reject it in our schools, reject it in our foreign policy, reject it in our [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=79.66s)]
*  immigration system and reject it at the ballot box this November. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  As I said, the likely only good thing in Chicago next week is they do have good natural casing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  hot talks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=96.34s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=97.34s)]
*  Here with Reaction Lawfare Project founder Brooke Goldstein. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=98.34s)]
*  She was at the Trump, with Trump at the event tonight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=101.5s)]
*  The president's unequivocal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=105.62s)]
*  He also said in his press conference today that Israel needs to win their war against [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=107.24s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  And he said, win it quickly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=114.0s)]
*  I support the president in that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=116.24s)]
*  But Joe and Kamala have surrendered in the war on terrorism, and she doesn't want us [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=118.56s)]
*  to use the word radical Islamic terrorism ever. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, we've spoken about this so many times, Sean. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=128.04s)]
*  Over the last 10 years, the stifling of public debate of what we're seeing right now, which [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=132.12s)]
*  is the radicalization of our country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=137.06s)]
*  And it was very privileged to have been invited to hear Trump speak and articulate his plan, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=139.82s)]
*  not just in how to end Jew hatred in this country, but how to defeat the radicalization. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=145.7s)]
*  And he said it very succinctly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=151.82s)]
*  He said, this is jihad in America. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=153.3s)]
*  We've seen these protests for almost a year now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=156.86s)]
*  And you don't have to be a genius to know that really it's not about freeing Palestine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=159.58s)]
*  It's not about Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=164.3s)]
*  It's about destabilizing this country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  And it's going to continue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=168.38s)]
*  And it's going to get worse unless there are real consequences for the people who break [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=170.06s)]
*  the law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=175.88s)]
*  But unfortunately, the people in power are not imposing those consequences. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=176.88s)]
*  So we have a situation, for example, where Islamism and married with Marxism is radicalizing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=180.9s)]
*  our youth and our universities to anti-American, anti-Israel values. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=187.54s)]
*  And yet the federal government continues to fund these universities in violation of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=192.58s)]
*  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=199.02s)]
*  You have protesters who are defacing monuments, who are assaulting the police while hoisting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  the Palestinian flag. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=206.34s)]
*  And what does this administration do? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  It drops charges. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  And of course, we have Tim Waltz now meeting with radical Islamists, calling them master [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  teachers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  Where do we go from here if there are no consequences for this type of lawlessness? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  What part of murder and rape and kidnapping and torture and beheading do they not get? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=222.66000000000003s)]
*  Brooke, thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFh-oO3sVc&t=229.86s)]
