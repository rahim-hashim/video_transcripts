# California is descending into ‘disrepair’: Jillian Michaels
**Fox News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0)
*  All right joining us now with more host of keeping it real a podcast which is part of the club random studios [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=0.0s)]
*  Available anywhere you listen to podcasts and now also on video format on YouTube [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=7.04s)]
*  Jillian Michaels. Well, first of all, I've been a fan for a long time [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=12.38s)]
*  I don't know if you know this I'm into mixed martial arts and health wellness fitness and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=16.2s)]
*  I don't think I'd want to train with you because I think you kick my ass [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=21.92s)]
*  Putting because you're pretty tough. I've watched you in action [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=25.92s)]
*  Hardcore [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=29.68s)]
*  However, I I listen to this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=31.4s)]
*  I'm gonna read back one of your lines that you said the sage and I really want to get your thoughts on this because [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=33.36s)]
*  Like you I made the decision. I left New York. I grew up in New York [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=37.4s)]
*  I've traveled the world, you know doing radio and all that stuff and lived in five different states, but [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=40.0s)]
*  Including California, but when you said I hold a million cards in your game of woke victim ology poker [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  And when I leave California, you know, maybe you've lost your effing mind just maybe [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Don't think I've heard anything more powerful that that interview blew me away [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  Talk about you know, here's the thing as I said to sage I grew up in California and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=63.48s)]
*  I have all of the reasons to be a quote liberal and in the classic sense of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=70.44s)]
*  What that means to me it means live and let live but where the left has gone [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=77.72s)]
*  It's completely [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=83.32s)]
*  Pathetical to that it's the opposite of that. It's almost [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=85.08s)]
*  fascistic on the extreme left and that's what I was running from in California and the state is just [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=89.52s)]
*  descending into complete disrepair and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=97.8s)]
*  Another irony of California is that you know for me I work in health [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=101.24s)]
*  It's ridiculous that I'm talking to you only because I have no knowledge of politics [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=106.0s)]
*  Commenting on this but the fact that health also has become a political football [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  Gone are the days of me being on the light-hearted morning shows talking about six-pack abs and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=116.42s)]
*  Fighting for people's ability to question the kids vaccine schedule. I mean, it's ridiculous. We don't even allow conversations to happen anymore [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=121.74s)]
*  So when you look at the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=129.82s)]
*  I have friends who are experts and what's going on with that and they explained to me, you know, Jill [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=133.1s)]
*  There's really no such thing as homelessness because these people are either [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  Attics or they have mental health issues. We're not helping those people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=144.0s)]
*  $24 billion [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=149.16s)]
*  24 billion went to work on that crisis and there's nothing to show for it and homelessness has gone up [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=151.16s)]
*  And if you think that it's empathetic to allow people to literally die on the streets [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=158.04s)]
*  It's not it's so many things of that nature that I'm simply [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  outraged with the outright hypocrisy is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=170.56s)]
*  Staggering and unfortunately as I said to sage I could go on and on [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=174.6s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to me because I'm fairly libertarian about people in their personal lives. I believe in freedom [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=179.04s)]
*  I want the government off my back out of my life get away from all of us leave us alone [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  But they feel that they want to control every aspect of our life [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=191.48s)]
*  You know and you raise this with particular passion in that podcast as it relates to children [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=194.84s)]
*  Oh, and you're extreme. You're open-minded, you know [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=200.68s)]
*  You said and I know parents that are living through this to their kids think that maybe you know, they have gender identity issues [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay, but the idea that there is you know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=211.72s)]
*  10 11 12 13 years old are gonna make a life-changing decision is off the table for them and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=214.72s)]
*  Even if they disagree with me politically [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=223.48s)]
*  There is a war on our kids going on right now and I talk about it on my podcast with experts like Callie means [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=226.16s)]
*  Who I know has been on many different Fox shows. He's brilliant [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=233.18s)]
*  We're looking at it from big food [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=237.32s)]
*  Trying to literally push all of this crap on our kids and make it so that it's you can't say junk food in schools [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=240.32s)]
*  This was a California thing that circulated you can't call it junk food because it's it's racist [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=247.12s)]
*  It's just like what is happening or even pushing? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=252.6s)]
*  this sort of gender affirming ideology on young kids and here's the thing if a child is trans [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=257.52s)]
*  Okay, great support that child. But and what I mean by that is I would let my kids explore it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=264.96s)]
*  I would never judge them. I would talk to them about it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=270.18s)]
*  I might get them some help to really deal with what's going on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  Is there something underlying and when we look at things like the cast review? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=276.52s)]
*  Which is in my opinion that the seminal work on this this was dr. Hillary Cass in the UK. Oh, yeah [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=280.88s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=287.38s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask you this because I contend as a conservative that the left has especially in big cities where they have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=288.88s)]
*  Dominated they have had power for decades and decades or a state like, California [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=297.64s)]
*  And I know Gavin Newsom like him personally don't agree with the thing he's doing or saying I think he's nuts [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=301.68s)]
*  Politically, but you know you see people like yourself you're leaving, California. I left New York. I'm in Florida [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  Probably the best decision I've ever made for a lot of reasons some of which I would agree with you on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=313.96s)]
*  But if you look at these big cities look at their educational system there [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=318.76s)]
*  We pay more per capita per student the worst results [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=323.11999999999995s)]
*  How is it with law and order and safety and security are they say it's gone up because? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  I [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=330.88s)]
*  Pursue happiness. Do you defund dismantle? No bail loss? How's that working out for people? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=332.0s)]
*  Like these people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=338.6s)]
*  I'm not asking who you're voting for. I'm not dragging you into that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=340.64s)]
*  I know what it is. I the problem with that question is that I don't want to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  Influence or suggest that I should have any influence over who people vote for I have no business jumping into that arena [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=348.88s)]
*  And I I try to avoid engaging in that conversation because I don't want people to think that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=354.72s)]
*  I feel my opinion matters [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=360.32s)]
*  It should influence their opinion or I judge them for it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=362.36s)]
*  but I don't know Sean and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=364.72s)]
*  I have had to talk with so many of my friends and the ones that got it or get it got it have left and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=367.84s)]
*  The ones that don't don't see it at all or by the way [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=374.2s)]
*  There's a handful of issues that matter to them and they're willing to sort of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=378.72s)]
*  Disregard all the things that that bother me and that's okay [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=383.72s)]
*  We all have a handful of issues that are important to us and we vote that way [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=387.76s)]
*  So for them it makes sense [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=392.64s)]
*  There are certain things on the right that really bother them and they overlook all the stuff that you and I are speaking about [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=395.44s)]
*  Which I find deeply alarming and gender affirming care has to do with the health of our kids [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=402.0s)]
*  It's about blocking purity and the dangers that creates for these children as their brain is developing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=406.64s)]
*  It's not about being transphobic [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  First of all, you're probably gonna take heat for even talking to me [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=416.64s)]
*  But I just ask people a simple question. Are you better off than your four are worth four years ago? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=419.24s)]
*  Are you okay with open borders? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=423.6s)]
*  11 million unvetted illegal immigrants. How's defund? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=425.88s)]
*  Dismantle no bail all working out for you. How's the economy doing for you? Do you like higher energy prices? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=430.56s)]
*  Okay, if you do vote for Kamala Harris [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you think America's role in the world we have about 30 seconds, I'll give you the last word [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=440.12s)]
*  I just think that the election should be about are you better off if you're better off than vote for Kamala Harris again [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=444.72s)]
*  Good luck. I don't think we are I totally agree with you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=451.88s)]
*  And my last word would be I bet you take heat for talking to me [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=455.44s)]
*  And I appreciate that you would engage in this conversation [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=458.92s)]
*  And the interesting thing is you'll see MSNBC having this conversation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=462.32s)]
*  They won't have a debate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  Conversation like this so I really appreciate you having me on I thank you for oh, I [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=468.84s)]
*  Appreciate it. This could be like a five-hour conversation [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe one day we'll have it but thank you. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyzSviWCI0&t=478.96s)]
