# What are the chances Biden gets impeached?
**Fox News:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU)
*  So what are the chances Biden gets impeached? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=0.0s)]
*  Here now with analysis, law professor and Fox News contributor, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=3.2s)]
*  one of my favorites, Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=6.08s)]
*  You know, Jonathan, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=9.52s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre said that Biden knew about [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=11.28s)]
*  Hunter's stunt, his defiant stunt, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=15.82s)]
*  where he didn't show up for his deposition. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=18.12s)]
*  And you said that this was a breathtaking mistake. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=19.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=23.96s)]
*  Well, there are about four articles of impeachment that are the most likely to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=24.8s)]
*  be pursued by the committee. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=29.8s)]
*  One of them's obstruction, another is the abuse of power. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Having the president involved in advance in any way to the contempt of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=37.4s)]
*  Congress is the worst possible scenario for the Biden team. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  I can't imagine how that could have occurred. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=48.28s)]
*  It's not that you're telling a father not to speak to his son, but [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=52.04s)]
*  you give very clear instructions that it's in neither of your interest [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=55.52s)]
*  for you to discuss his testimony before Congress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=60.72s)]
*  It certainly wouldn't be in your interest to talk about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=63.96s)]
*  the potential commission of a federal crime. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=67.08s)]
*  Contempt of Congress is a federal crime. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=70.6s)]
*  And the Department of Justice aggressively pursued people like Bannon and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=73.64s)]
*  Navarro for not appearing in a committee. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=77.52s)]
*  So if the president knew about that in advance and supported it, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=81.4s)]
*  it just gives another front for Congress to pursue in this inquiry. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point that you bring up. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=94.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=96.12s)]
*  This was buried deep in a Politico article, an Axios article rather. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  And it's about the relationship of the president with his attorney general. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  We know the DOJ is independent. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=104.12s)]
*  But it says this, Biden's relationship with Garland, his attorney general, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  which has already become more frigid, is now tense. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  Those close to Biden argue Garland's trying in vain to satisfy bad faith [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  GOP critics. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=118.4s)]
*  One person unflatteringly compared Garland to Comey, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  saying that both have been obsessed with the appearance of having integrity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, if it's frigid now, it's going to be perfectly glacial [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=131.6s)]
*  if the House moves to hold his son in contempt. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=134.88s)]
*  Garland is already on the record. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=138.6s)]
*  His Department of Justice pursued those earlier cases. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=140.08s)]
*  It just took a couple of months before Bannon went from not appearing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=143.32s)]
*  to having an indictment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  So I don't see how Merrick Garland could do anything but prosecute [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=149.52s)]
*  Hunter Biden if the House approves a contempt resolution. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=153.96s)]
*  But the interesting thing is that Garland did something for Biden [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=159.56s)]
*  that was invaluable. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=163.44s)]
*  He refused to appoint a special counsel to look into the corruption scandal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=165.04s)]
*  Many of us have been writing for years that we can't even imagine his rationale. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=170.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's name is all over these files. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=175.48s)]
*  There's millions of dollars going to his family. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=178.52s)]
*  And the circle is coming closer and closer to the president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=181.56s)]
*  And yet Merrick Garland has simply refused to appoint a special counsel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=185.04s)]
*  And so I think President Biden's got to give more credit than he's giving them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=189.28s)]
*  Professor Jonathan Turley, brilliant as always. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=195.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPX9nU271QU&t=197.68s)]
