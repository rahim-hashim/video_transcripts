**Fox News:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E)
*  All right, here with reaction, he is the host of Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=0.0s)]
*  I call him the great one, Mark Levin. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=3.36s)]
*  You know, Mark, not only did he surrender by doing this, America's commitment to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=5.16s)]
*  cause of liberty and freedom, its commitment to defeat radical Islamic terrorists—he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=11.68s)]
*  surrendered in the war on terror—he has now emboldened every terrorist organization [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=18.12s)]
*  starting with Iran, and he's done it because he basically has put political ambition and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=25.8s)]
*  the radicals in his party ahead of what is morally right and just. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=33.92s)]
*  There is right and wrong here, and there are victims here, and there are the victimizers, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=38.92s)]
*  the terrorists, that are responsible for all of this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=45.72s)]
*  You know, let me speak to this, Sean, from my heart. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=49.64s)]
*  You know, when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, my grandfather was 34 at the time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=53.64s)]
*  He joined the Marine Corps. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=60.64s)]

*  His buddy, his brother-in-law, my great uncle, Teddy, he joined the Marines the same day, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  and he wound up fighting at Guam and the Solomon Islands. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=71.24s)]
*  My family, we are red-blooded Americans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wfwGhVT4E&t=75.52s)]
