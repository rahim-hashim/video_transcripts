**Fox News:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg)
*  And welcome to Hannity and thank you for being with us the New Hampshire primary is now in the books [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is now two for two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=4.62s)]
*  But Nikki Haley is vowing to move forward and coming up tonight the very latest fallout the polls [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=6.7s)]
*  Analysis and we look ahead to Nevada and South Carolina now also tonight [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=12.72s)]
*  We're gonna bring you a very special interview with Vice President [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=18.5s)]
*  Harris apparently the border czar has now dedicated more time and effort to correcting her height on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=22.0s)]
*  Wikipedia than actually securing our wide open southern border that they keep telling us in line to us is closed and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=29.62s)]
*  Totally secure meanwhile despite not campaigning in New Hampshire [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=37.66s)]
*  It has been a very trying week for your commander-in-chief Joe Biden. Just take a look [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=41.38s)]
*  We'll teach Donald Trump an a valuable lesson [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=46.82s)]
*  Don't mess with the men in America unless you want to get the benefit [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=50.94s)]
*  We're gonna give you multiple opportunities tonight to be able to decipher [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=55.099999999999994s)]
*  And determine what it is. He actually said there because not only is Biden now slurring his speeches [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=60.62s)]
*  But he's also getting heckled and getting heckled repeatedly by members of his own party [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=66.22s)]
*  They now are calling him genocide Joe and that's not all last night's results out of New Hampshire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, frankly pretty embarrassing for Joe Biden you have a congressman [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=76.82s)]
*  How many of you really have heard anything about Dean Phillips who you know few people have heard of him [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=81.10000000000001s)]
*  he took 21% of the vote Marianne Williamson took another 5% and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  Biden won the state with what 55% of the vote the lowest total for a sitting Democratic president since Jimmy Carter in the Republican primary [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=92.5s)]
*  Trump pulled off yet [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  another double-digit win in a hotly contested race against former ambassador Nikki Haley and between her campaign and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Super PACs well nearly 30 million dollars was spent on governor Haley in the state of New Hampshire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=110.72s)]
*  That's twice the amount spent by former President Trump and Haley also got a big boost from [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=116.72s)]
*  Independents and Democrats who registered as independents in order to vote in the state's open primary system [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=122.16s)]
*  According to even a CNN exit poll a whopping 70% of Haley voters in New Hampshire [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=129.44s)]
*  They were not registered Republicans and still Donald Trump pulled off a double-digit win [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=135.28s)]
*  Amid record turnout in the Granite State. They had a huge turnout and the next contest is in Nevada [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=141.0s)]
*  Where Haley is not even on the ballot in the state's caucus and then from there Trump and Haley they'll face off in South Carolina [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Now this is Nikki Haley's home state where not long ago [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=155.52s)]
*  She was a popular governor and yet according to the real clear politics average Donald Trump is up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=159.0s)]
*  By 30 points in the state of North South Carolina Nikki Haley. She's facing a steep uphill battle [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=165.12s)]
*  So it's no surprise that she and Donald Trump are now exchanging barbs [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=172.52s)]
*  Politics, it's simply spill is spoken. It's just a blood sport and like almost every primary the rage [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, the race gets heated at some point and it's getting to that point Haley claims [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=183.44s)]
*  She is more electable than Donald Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=188.12s)]
*  But according to a brand new messenger Harris poll well Trump is now beating Biden by a whopping seven points in a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Hypothetical matchup that's more than double Haley's lead against Biden in a recent poll and needless to say the mob the media [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=197.32s)]
*  No, simply they're just terrified. They're scared to death. Take a look [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=204.08s)]
*  What we are looking at here is an extremist MAGA base that is motivated by the politics of grievance [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=208.44s)]
*  And that is Donald Trump incarnate. What did you think about the Tim Scott moment on the stage with Trump? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=214.28s)]
*  I mean, I've called this the great [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=225.08s)]
*  Emasculation of the Republican Party Trump has completely [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=228.36s)]
*  Emasculated these guys there are few [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=232.52s)]
*  Moments in my life. I've been more embarrassed than to watch Tim Scott [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=235.48s)]
*  Who you know, I know Tim and I are both practicing Christians, but I don't know if he could pray like that to the other side [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=239.84s)]
*  I mean it was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=247.94s)]
*  Humiliating to watch what Tim Scott did no one will remember the margin of victory after last after tonight [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=249.88s)]
*  But people will remember that speech which was vicious that point even vile [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=256.0s)]
*  What he's offering is strongman leadership the end of politics the end of elections the end or the or the sidelining or domesticating [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=260.18s)]
*  As we've been yet says of the judiciary [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=267.22s)]
*  And the Congress it'll be he'll be the man in charge and he'll get it done [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's what he's selling and that's what they are very eager to buy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=274.18s)]
*  Attacking African-American conservatives. That's fair game as per usual now for the better part of the of a decade so-called [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuU2zl_Wjg&t=277.42s)]
