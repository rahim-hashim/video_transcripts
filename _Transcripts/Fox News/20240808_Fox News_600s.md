# Sean Hannity: Kamala has been humiliated
**Fox News:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and tonight Kamala's embattled running mate Tim Walz is facing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=0.0s)]
*  fresh new scrutiny over a military career. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=5.48s)]
*  He is credibly accused of embellishing for political gain. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=8.52s)]
*  Claims of stolen valor and downright lying. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=12.96s)]
*  While they're getting so much traction, the Harris campaign had to change his bio, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=15.44s)]
*  and full details are coming up straight ahead. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=20.36s)]
*  Also, former congresswoman—you won't believe this story—Tulsi Gabbard, who also served [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=22.36s)]
*  in the military, reportedly put on a government terrorist watch list. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=26.4s)]
*  More weaponization of our Justice Department. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=31.96s)]
*  Under Biden and Harris, your federal government is completely out of control. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=34.56s)]
*  Tulsi will join us in a moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=39.36s)]
*  She'll respond to the egregious abuse of power. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=40.68s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=43.2s)]
*  But first, a moment of bravery from Kamala Harris, as she likes to say this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=44.2s)]
*  I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been, you know? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  UNDER died her missing girl Marketwithkids, online and YouTube, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  heard the Old-Boy well. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=83.12s)]
*  The vice president anxiously walked, you know, toward her doting fans in the media mob for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=88.12s)]
*  a little over a minute. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=94.4s)]
*  And wow, without any help from a teleprompter, and somehow she managed to talk ever so briefly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  to the state-run Pravda media mob. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=101.54s)]
*  Now, it was only the second time since her coronation that Kamala actually summoned a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=104.4s)]
*  little courage to speak off-script. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=108.78s)]
*  And the very first time she has answered any questions about her campaign. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  But don't expect to see much from the vice president off-script moving forward. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=115.18s)]
*  Kamala said she might participate in one sit-down interview sometime before the end of the month, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=119.92s)]
*  probably with the conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=126.92s)]
*  If we're lucky, take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=130.04s)]
*  Great job. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=142.48s)]
*  You know, you know, what can be? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  It's August the 8th. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=147.28s)]
*  So let's get this straight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=148.72s)]
*  She's going to need total, what, seven weeks of preparation for one interview? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=149.72s)]
*  One press conference? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  One gaggle? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Why not sit down for an entire interview tomorrow? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  I guess she's not capable. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  According to the Daily Mail, Kamala's latest solo press conference was on December 2nd, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  2023. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=167.64s)]
*  And that one wasn't very long. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=168.64s)]
*  That was a whopping 12 minutes, and she took six questions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=170.0s)]
*  Probably she knew about them in advance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=173.4s)]
*  Now, of course, a lot has happened since December of 2023, but Kamala has been unable or unwilling [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=175.76s)]
*  to answer any questions until today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=182.08s)]
*  If you consider that answering questions, her unscripted and uncomfortable minute of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=184.36s)]
*  dialogue today was not by choice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=189.6s)]
*  Over the past week, Kamala has been humiliated by both Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, in fact, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=192.32s)]
*  the first person to take questions from Kamala's press pool. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=197.68s)]
*  Well, that was actually J.D. Vance on the tarmac right there in front of Air Force Two, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=200.88s)]
*  while Kamala just was a few yards away. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=206.84s)]
*  She was busy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=209.12s)]
*  Now, get this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=210.12s)]
*  A few hours before Kamala's minute-long Q&A, former President Donald Trump, he conducted [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=211.12s)]
*  an hour-plus long press conference where he answered questions pretty much about everything [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  under the sun, had this to say about his opponent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=224.96s)]
*  She's not doing any news conference. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=226.16s)]
*  You know why she's not doing it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=227.72s)]
*  Because she can't do a news conference. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=228.72s)]
*  She doesn't know how to do a news conference. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=230.12s)]
*  She's not smart enough to do a news conference. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=231.6s)]
*  And I'm sorry, we need smart people to lead this country, because our country's never [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=233.96s)]
*  been in this danger before. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  I've never felt that much danger as we feel now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=241.08s)]
*  If Kamala wants to silence critics, well, she could step up to the podium, answer questions [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=244.16s)]
*  for an hour. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=249.08s)]
*  Most everyone in the state run media mobs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=250.08s)]
*  I have a supporter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=252.08s)]
*  So there's really nothing stopping her. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=253.76s)]
*  It's not like she's busy fixing the border or stopping inflation or lowering energy prices. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=256.24s)]
*  She hasn't lifted a finger to reduce violent crime, gas prices through the roof, or finding [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=261.28s)]
*  a solution to wars overseas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=267.0s)]
*  Like Joe Biden, she barely does one event per day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=270.0s)]
*  The rest of the day, she's hiding in the equivalent of Joe Biden's basement, and they're [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=273.16s)]
*  covering for her like they did for Biden in 2020. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=277.92s)]
*  And yet, for some reason, grinning from ear to ear, and when she has the moment, giggling [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=282.32s)]
*  and announcing today that she was just—she just loves hard work, loves hard work, loves it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=287.84s)]
*  Look. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=293.12s)]
*  You know, the one thing about all of us is we like hard work. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=294.12s)]
*  Hard work is good work. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=298.52s)]
*  Hard work is good work. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  The thing that we like about hard work is we have fun doing hard work. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=302.92s)]
*  Because we know what we stand for. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=309.72s)]
*  Well, her very own staff, they paint a very different picture. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  Quote, Kamala Harris is a clueless bully who refuses to do her homework. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  Remember, 90 percent turnover rate? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's also another reason Kamala is unwilling to speak off-script. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  She is running from her own radical, extreme, dangerous, deadly, in some cases, record. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=326.94000000000005s)]
*  Now, both Kamala and her socialist running mate, they have taken the most radical positions [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  on literally everything. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=338.12s)]
*  They're getting a pass from the state-run, propped-up media mob, but they want to ban [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=339.12s)]
*  fracking and drilling. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=344.26s)]
*  They want to defund the police, dismantle it, reimagine it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=345.32s)]
*  They want to abolish ICE. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=348.48s)]
*  She compared it to the KKK. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  They want to totally decriminalize all illegal immigration. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=352.3s)]
*  They support open borders and free education, healthcare, housing and driver's licenses [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=355.72s)]
*  for illegals. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  They support the insane $93 trillion Green New Deal, the redistribution of wealth scam [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=362.8s)]
*  of all scams in favor of raising taxes, 70 to 80 percent. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=370.4s)]
*  They support gun confiscation. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  They want to protect, oh, sex change surgeries and puberty blockers for young kids even without [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=377.56s)]
*  parental consent in the case of walls. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=383.48s)]
*  They want to criminalize speech that they find uncomfortable. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=386.96s)]
*  They have supported all of these insane policies for years. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=390.58s)]
*  Abortion up to the moment of birth, no problem. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=394.3s)]
*  In fact, according to FoxNews.com, Walls even supported a plan to curb Social Security payments [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  and increase the retirement age. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=404.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump wants to end taxing people on Social Security, said he won't [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=406.7s)]
*  ever cut Social Security and he won't tax tips for workers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  So she's going after old people and she thinks if you're 18 to 24, you're dumb, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=416.74s)]
*  really dumb. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=421.3s)]
*  That's why they put you in dormitories with RAs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=422.3s)]
*  Now, it's a different story for Harris and Walls, only now they have suddenly and miraculously [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=424.58s)]
*  experienced what we call an election year conversion, or at least that's what their [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=429.98s)]
*  staffers are saying behind closed doors. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=435.12s)]
*  Now, Kamala won't actually say where she's standing on all the controversial issues she's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=437.66s)]
*  taken in the past. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=443.02s)]
*  Now, if she says she changed them, that would mean she changed them only when she was becoming [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  or became the presumptive Democratic nominee. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=450.14s)]
*  That would be a completely dishonest lie, election year conversion. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=453.74s)]
*  Her positions are not even listed on her campaign website, very unprecedented. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=458.72s)]
*  And speaking of the campaign website, only a few days after her running mate was accused [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=464.42s)]
*  of embellishing his service in the National Guard, well, the Harris campaign, they were [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=469.02s)]
*  now forced to change Walls' biography to reflect the true story. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=473.78s)]
*  Now, many of those that have served with Walls, they're accusing him of stolen valor, serious [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  charge for inflating his rank, pretending that he was deployed to a combat zone with [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=485.29999999999995s)]
*  a gun that, you know, should never be used outside of war zones that he wanted to take [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=492.78s)]
*  away from law-abiding citizens. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=497.7s)]
*  In reality, Walls quickly retired shortly before his platoon was scheduled to deploy [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  to Iraq, even though he had already signed on to serve for two more years. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=504.9s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on this coming up later in the show. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=509.82s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, this is a story you're not going to hear about on the other so-called [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=512.9s)]
*  news outlets. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=517.98s)]
*  Do you remember why Dan Rather was given the exit door over at Fake News CBS? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=518.98s)]
*  Remember that whole story? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=526.26s)]
*  Remember the coverage of the National Guard and George W. Bush? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=527.78s)]
*  Their reporting was wrong. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=531.82s)]
*  It looks like, based on them changing the website, everybody else has the story right, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=533.58s)]
*  except the media won't cover it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=538.26s)]
*  You know, instead, what are we getting? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=539.74s)]
*  Coverage from this, like, from Politico, quote, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=541.74s)]
*  male politicians, they're usually terrible at dressing down, but Tim Walls is one of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=544.54s)]
*  the few that can actually pull it off. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=549.94s)]
*  And this report, titled, quote, Tim Walls was my teacher 20 years ago. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=552.58s)]
*  Here's what I learned. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=557.66s)]
*  Here's one glowing caption from that article, quote, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=559.1s)]
*  Walls didn't overload his students with burdensome homework. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  He challenged them in other ways, forcing them to wrestle with issues like the Cambodian [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=565.74s)]
*  genocide and how the French government treated Muslim citizens. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=571.06s)]
*  Now, despite all this fawning media coverage, and it's pretty much everywhere, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=575.14s)]
*  O'Kamala Harris and Tim Walls are still ducking, dodging the press. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=579.42s)]
*  It's not a good look for a pair of far-left politicians who have yet to receive a single [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  primary vote. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRaDNaHWrbU&t=587.38s)]
