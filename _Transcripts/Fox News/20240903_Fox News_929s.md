# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris showed off an embarrassingly fake accent
**Fox News:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight we begin with a big announcement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow night we will be in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=4.34s)]
*  We will be in Harrisburg for an exclusive town hall with former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=6.8s)]
*  President Trump will be responding to Kamala Harris right here on the show. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=12.44s)]
*  Now, you can check out Hannity.com for tickets, details, availability. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=15.44s)]
*  Of course, we are happy to give Kamala Harris a full hour as well, if she's up to it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=19.52s)]
*  But don't hold your breath. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=26.36s)]
*  Since the beginning of August, Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, they have given a whopping [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=27.4s)]
*  34 interviews, while Harris and Walz have participated in—let me add them up—one, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  just one, with pro-Harris, liberal talk show host Dana Bash on Faked News CNN, perhaps [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=37.8s)]
*  maybe one of the greatest epic fail interviews of all time, certainly one of the biggest [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=46.2s)]
*  missed opportunities for a, quote, get I've ever seen in my career. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=51.8s)]
*  And that was the final cut. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  We've never seen the full, unedited version, as we were promised. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=59.52s)]
*  The interview lasts less than 30 minutes, just over, what, 16 minutes of talk time for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Kamala, 16 minutes and, what, 29 seconds. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=68.72s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=72.56s)]
*  And we were all reminded in that short period of time why the Harris campaign is scared [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  to death to allow their candidate to speak for herself, unscripted, hold a press conference, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=78.18s)]
*  do a gaggle, and why she, you know, brought her security blanket, Mr. Stolen Valor, the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=83.72s)]
*  congenital liar, Tim Walz with her. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=90.04s)]
*  And despite all the softball questions from Bash, with multiple choice answers and virtually [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=92.84s)]
*  no strong follow-up, Kamala embarrassed herself, was unable to explain any of her egregious [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=98.62s)]
*  and sudden flipping, flopping and flailing on pretty much everything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=105.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, on the campaign trail, more embarrassment for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=109.2s)]
*  Take a look at her screen yesterday during a desperate and sloppy attempt, look at what [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=113.76s)]
*  we got here, to avoid reporters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=118.04s)]
*  She's like pretending to be on a call using earphones while also holding what is a blank [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=120.08s)]
*  phone up to her ear. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=127.36s)]
*  Kamala might want to pick one or the other next time she's faking a phone call. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=129.8s)]
*  But Kamala's fake phony behavior doesn't stop there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=134.52s)]
*  While delivering the same speech in two separate locations, one in Detroit, one in Pittsburgh, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=137.5s)]
*  Kamala's dialect changes dramatically. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=144.12s)]
*  The words were the same, the accents were very different. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=145.96s)]
*  You decide. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=149.8s)]
*  You may not be a union member, you better thank a union member. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=150.8s)]
*  For the five day work week. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=155.8s)]
*  You better thank a union member for sick leave. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=158.8s)]
*  You better thank a union member for paid leave. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=161.8s)]
*  You better thank a union member for vacation time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=164.8s)]
*  You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five day work week. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=170.44s)]
*  Thank unions for sick leave. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=175.44s)]
*  Thank unions for paid family leave. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=178.44s)]
*  Thank unions for your vacation time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=181.44s)]
*  Let's just get through the next 64 days. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=187.44s)]
*  So friends, 64 days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=193.44s)]
*  Until the most election of our lives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  You can also thank Kamala and Joe for $4.5 billion in losses that Ford suffered as they [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  were forced to produce cars that their customers didn't want, electric vehicles that they've [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  had to since stop because high paying career jobs were in jeopardy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=213.2s)]
*  Union jobs, great jobs, career jobs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  And keep in mind Harris grew up in a wealthy area of Montreal in Canada. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=221.18s)]
*  Was this her way of trying to talk like a blue collar auto worker or what she might [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=225.76s)]
*  imagine one might sound like? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=231.26s)]
*  Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is using what now a fake accent on top of everything else [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=233.92s)]
*  that is fake in Detroit. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=238.6s)]
*  Now drawing comparisons of Foghorn, Leghorn and Hillary's infamous I don't feel in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=240.64s)]
*  no ways tired and speech in Selma, Alabama. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=247.32s)]
*  Why do Democratic presidential candidates always seem to shift their tone, their pitch, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=251.84s)]
*  their cadence, you know, so often? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=257.04s)]
*  It's beyond bizarre. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=260.32s)]
*  Actually it's weird to use her campaign's favorite word. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=261.88s)]
*  And while Kamala showed off an embarrassingly fake accent in Detroit, well she treated the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=265.72s)]
*  crowd in Pittsburgh to an old favorite. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=271.08s)]
*  Maybe you've heard this before. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=274.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=275.84s)]
*  We have dreams. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=276.96s)]
*  We can see what is possible unburdened by what has been. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=279.2s)]
*  We have aspirations. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  We have ambitions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=287.08s)]
*  to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, despite her best wishes, Kamala is in fact burdened by what has been, and that is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  the worst administration in modern history. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=305.72s)]
*  She wants like a reset. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  I haven't been here for four years. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=309.72s)]
*  Don't blame me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's an administration that bears her name. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  It's especially true in Afghanistan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=318.24s)]
*  13 U.S. service members murdered along with hundreds of others. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  Americans abandoned behind enemy lines are allies that helped us for 20 years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Many of them were taken from their homes never to be seen or heard from again. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  During the Harris Biden administration and their horrific withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=333.48s)]
*  this was one of the worst moments in American history. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=338.72s)]
*  And as Kamala used to brag, she was the last person in the room with the very courageous [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden when he made that fateful decision to hastily withdraw from the country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=347.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=353.24s)]
*  President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, particularly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=354.8s)]
*  for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=359.36s)]
*  He just made a really big decision. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=362.44s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=364.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=365.28s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=366.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=367.64s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=368.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=370.16s)]
*  And I'm going to add to that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=372.24s)]
*  This is a president who has an extraordinary amount of courage. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=377.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=383.92s)]
*  Comfortable? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=384.92s)]
*  13 dead Americans and those families, they're burdened by what has been. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=385.92s)]
*  And because of Kamala and Joe's inept decision-making and horrific planning, Americans were left [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=390.64s)]
*  to fend for themselves behind enemy lines. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  Afghan nationals were literally falling from the sky trying to cling to American cargo [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=400.56s)]
*  planes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=405.84s)]
*  And billions of dollars in sophisticated U.S. military equipment was, what, surrendered [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  to the Taliban. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=412.8s)]
*  And again, 13 brave Americans killed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=414.32s)]
*  Kamala never bothered once to ever talk to the family. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  She won't return their messages. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=420.24s)]
*  Neither she nor Joe ever apologized to the families that caused the death of their loved [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=422.6s)]
*  ones. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  These policies got these Americans killed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  She didn't show up at Arlington National Cemetery during an event honoring these fallen [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  service members after Gold Star families invited her to appear. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=437.08s)]
*  The lack of basic human decency from Kamala Harris is appalling. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=442.44s)]
*  Families that have lost loved ones murdered because of their unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=447.0s)]
*  and raped by their unvetted illegal immigrants and victims of horrific crime by their unvetted [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=451.78s)]
*  illegal immigrants, no calls to those families either. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=457.04s)]
*  According to the state-run media mob, the real scandal is that Donald Trump broke protocol [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=460.64s)]
*  by taking a picture with Gold Star families and other wounded veterans at Arlington Cemetery. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=465.8s)]
*  Trump was asked by the families to take—what was he supposed to say to a grieving family? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=474.08s)]
*  No, I'm not going to take a picture with you? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=480.84s)]
*  While Joe was sleeping on the beach for the 400th day and Kamala was what? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=483.44s)]
*  Doing God knows what? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=488.08s)]

*  Who didn't take campaign photos there? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=519.24s)]
*  These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=520.92s)]
*  Harris' incompetence invited him to the cemetery, and they asked him to take those photos. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=527.04s)]

*  She was four miles away. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=543.8s)]
*  Ten minutes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=545.16s)]

*  who likely died because of Joe and Kamala's negligence. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=596.88s)]

*  Are you going to demand basic answers to basic questions that Kamala, up to now, has never [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  answered? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=629.64s)]

*  She sent that out four days after a police precinct was burned to the ground. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=680.6s)]

*  You know, let's put feminine hygiene products in boys' bathrooms in school. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=755.98s)]

*  lockdown laws. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=810.46s)]

*  so much from the Freedom and Joy Party. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has called for an end to the Second Amendment. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=820.34s)]
*  You know, with a gun federal buyback confiscation law, Kamala worked to censor Americans on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=823.82s)]
*  social media. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=830.0s)]
*  She wants to ban choice of medicine, no more private health insurance. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=831.48s)]

*  And don't even get me started on all the new taxes that Kamala wants to deduct from [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=843.86s)]
*  your paycheck. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=848.4200000000001s)]

*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, they're not part of a Freedom and Joy Party. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=854.38s)]

*  is a woman of color who has overcome numerous obstacles to become a leader in her field. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuguQ3YizQ&t=902.48s)]
