# Victor Davis Hanson: We're on the verge of insanity
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU)
*  All right, it's transparent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's clear Biden has no plan to fix the crisis at the border that he himself created. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=1.46s)]
*  And with the situation now rapidly deteriorating in Haiti, how is he going to handle the possible [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=6.46s)]
*  large influx of people from Haiti? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=12.1s)]
*  According to a new report, the administration is actually discussing the possibility of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=14.58s)]
*  actually using Guantanamo Bay, Gitmo, to process them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=19.14s)]
*  What does that mean, process them? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=22.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, more disturbing crimes committed by illegals, they're coming to light. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=24.46s)]
*  Three illegal immigrants from Guatemala have been accused of sexual assault and kidnapping [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=28.84s)]
*  of a woman in Florida. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=34.0s)]
*  Another from El Salvador was charged with 20 counts of sex abuse and sex offenses of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=35.52s)]
*  minors while working at a church in Maryland after previously being deported twice, according [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  to ICE. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=48.24s)]
*  And a woman in the U.S. illegally from Venezuela was arrested for driving the wrong way down [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  a highway, causing a head-on collision. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=54.46s)]
*  That resulted in the death of a 12-year-old boy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Here with reaction is Hoover, Institution, senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson, Fox & Friends, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=60.0s)]
*  Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=65.24s)]
*  All right, it's all happening. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=66.72s)]
*  And it's interesting, Governor DeSantis is smart enough to figure out there's no way [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=69.16s)]
*  Biden's going to do anything about what is likely going to be a large influx from Haiti, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=74.14s)]
*  so he's already putting measures to protect his own state, kind of like what Governor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=79.04s)]
*  Abbott's been having to do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=84.04s)]
*  Your reaction, Victor Davis Hanson. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=86.08s)]
*  Well, I think we're getting back to every man for himself, every state for himself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=90.78s)]
*  There is no federal immigration law. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=95.14s)]
*  Biden destroyed it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=97.14s)]
*  And it shows you how desperate they are to do something stupid, to let eight million [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=98.14s)]
*  people in from some of the most violent places in the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=102.5s)]
*  And why are they doing it, Sean? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=105.9s)]
*  I guess the prime directive is to get future constituencies who, under mail-in balloting, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=107.38s)]
*  may be of value. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=113.42s)]
*  And they figure that to make this beautiful, diverse DEI omelet, they have to break a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=115.0s)]
*  few eggs, like, unfortunately, like Laken Reilly or Kate Steinle, whom they consider [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=120.72s)]
*  just collateral damage. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  They don't really care about these people who were tragically killed or harmed or maimed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And they feel they're going to be protected, Sean. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  They have the money, the influence, the zip codes, that these policies will never lap [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=134.28s)]
*  up on their shores. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=138.4s)]
*  The irony, final irony really quickly is, if they bring all these people in, and they're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=139.8s)]
*  located in the barrio and the inner city and East Palestine, Ohio and working-class communities, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=144.78s)]
*  they're going to alienate a lot of people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  And if they alienate their base, they'll close the border in one second, because they don't [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=153.9s)]
*  have any principles other than the retention of power. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=157.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  And then here we are, Pete Hagseth, with the president apologizing for using the term [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  illegal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=166.58s)]
*  We played a tape last night. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  I won't play it again tonight, of Chuck Schumer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=169.56s)]
*  This is Chuckie back in 2009 saying, they're illegal aliens, they're not, they're not respecting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=171.8s)]
*  our laws, and it's wrong to use the term undocumented because it minimizes the crime that they're [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=178.02s)]
*  committing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=183.52s)]
*  It kind of sounded like us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=184.52s)]
*  But obviously that Democratic party's dead, gone, buried, never to be seen or heard from [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=187.02s)]
*  again, is kind of how I'm viewing it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=192.16s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  Sean, you're right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  They used to believe in the basics. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=197.48s)]
*  The basics are borders. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=200.28s)]
*  The basics are citizenship. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  The idea of citizenship is in retrospect for the Democrat party. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=204.34s)]
*  They don't care about it anymore. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=209.06s)]
*  You hear about, whether it's charities or politicians or local nonprofits, they want [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  anyone they can get for reasons, as Victor said, for votes or for future census and congressional [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  districts. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=224.26s)]
*  Citizenship is a bygone word for them because they believe no person can be illegal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=226.3s)]
*  Sean, I served in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  It had been set up to process people coming across the sea for a long time before it was [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=234.38000000000002s)]
*  a detention facility for Islamists. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  It was meant to repatriate, meaning if you were on a boat seeking a better life and you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=242.62s)]
*  landed at Guantanamo Bay, we sent you back to your home country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  You noted the word. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=251.9s)]
*  It was process. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=253.22000000000003s)]
*  Would this administration send them back or would they neatly process them to put them [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  on a flight and send them to somewhere in the continental United States that we're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=260.32s)]
*  not told about? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=265.44s)]
*  We have no idea at all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=266.68s)]
*  And ultimately, this is also the administration that said we want to close Guantanamo Bay [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=269.2s)]
*  because they didn't want to process Islamists who were there trying to kill us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=273.96s)]
*  So they're full of contradictions, not putting the country first and putting illegals first. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=278.68s)]
*  But they won't call them illegals. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  Make sense of that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  You know what they do in Australia, Victor Davis Hansen? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  If you're trying to enter Australia illegally, you will be met at sea. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=290.62s)]
*  Now you will be handed food, medicine if you need it, water, whatever necessities you need, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=296.9s)]
*  whatever you need, and then you're going to be sent home. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=304.18s)]
*  If you need medical care, they won't even bring you to the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=306.7s)]
*  They'll bring you to another island. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=309.34s)]
*  They will provide that medical care and then send you back. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  Why doesn't America just simply adopt that strategy? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=313.76s)]
*  Well, I think we've got to dispense with the idea, Sean, that we all say that the Europeans [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=319.56s)]
*  or the Australians or all of these kindred democracies are socialists and they're left-wing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  and they're crazy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=328.6s)]
*  We're the crazy ones now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=329.6s)]
*  If you look at the immigration revolution that's going on in Europe and Australia and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=331.04s)]
*  other places, they're far more reasonable than we are. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=335.32s)]
*  We're the outlier of the family of democratic nations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=338.76s)]
*  We're on the verge of insanity and suicidal destruction. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=342.4s)]
*  They look at us and they think we're crazy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=345.9s)]
*  So this is serious. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=348.14s)]
*  We can't any longer judge these other countries and say they're naive, they're letting in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  immigrants across the Mediterranean or the Pacific. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=354.02s)]
*  What we do is far worse than they've done. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=356.9s)]
*  They've learned their lesson and they're just in time, they're self-correcting. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=359.73999999999995s)]
*  We're not. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=362.62s)]
*  We're doubling down. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=363.7s)]
*  Well, if Trump's elected, he has promised to deport every illegal immigrant, people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=364.7s)]
*  that didn't respect our laws, our borders, our sovereignty. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=369.68s)]
*  That time has come. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=373.44s)]
*  All right, Victor Davis Hanson, Pete Hegset, thank you both. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kKZtSU4TU&t=374.44s)]
