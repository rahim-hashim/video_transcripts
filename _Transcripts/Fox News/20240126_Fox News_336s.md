# Rick Perry: This is a constitutional crisis and Texans won't put up with it
**Fox News:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk)
*  Joining us now is someone who knows an awful lot about our southern border. That's former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas governor, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Governor, good to see you. I really [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=4.08s)]
*  feel for the people of Texas, the only thing that I take heart in is that the Border Patrol, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  federal Border Patrol, they were saying, they're not going in, they're not cutting that razor [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=15.92s)]
*  wire, they're not going to have a confrontation with Texas National Guard. What if, what if [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=20.88s)]
*  Joe Biden then tries to federalize Texas's guard? What's going to happen? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=25.76s)]
*  Yeah, good on those men and women. Let me say first, God bless Greg Abbott standing up [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=30.16s)]
*  and basically saying he's not going to allow this continual dilution of our country, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  this just overrunning of our border, the literal letting in of these individuals who, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=45.2s)]
*  you nailed it right on the head, Sean, when you talked about there's a lot of bad people involved [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  in this that are coming across the border, people we don't know who they are, but I guarantee, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=56.88s)]
*  as sure as God made strawberries, that some of them are being sent here with bad intent in their [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=62.56s)]
*  mind. And on, they're going to, they're going to go do some bad things in this country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=69.44s)]
*  And Greg Abbott and those 25 other governors that stood up, God bless them as well. I'm telling you, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=75.2s)]
*  this administration likes to talk about constitutional crises that be created by [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=82.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. And right here, right before our eyes, we see a constitutional crisis being created [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=88.16s)]
*  by the Biden administration. And Texans aren't going to put up with it. They're standing up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=95.6s)]
*  They're doing what's right. And I hope that it doesn't turn into anything worse than just being [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  put out. But the other thing that's going to happen is Texas is going to become a substantially [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=108.48s)]
*  redder state than it already is. Those Hispanic, historically Democrats along the border are seeing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=115.28s)]
*  what this administration is doing, and they're going to walk away from the Democrat Party and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=122.0s)]
*  say, no more, we've had it with you. We're going to go join the party that's of a rule of law [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  and that believes in keeping our country safe and sound and economically viable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=131.68s)]
*  Governor, the two of us spent a lot of time in this very area. We even did a show from the border [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=138.48s)]
*  right by the Rio Grande. I was out with you on boats. You got to really educate me in this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=144.16s)]
*  particular area. There is nothing in that decision by the Supreme Court that forces Texas to take [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=150.88s)]
*  down any wire. There's nothing in that decision that prevents them from putting up more wire. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=158.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if I look at the Constitution, I'll look down, if you don't mind, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=163.6s)]
*  Article 4 says the federal government shall protect the states against invasion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, John Solomon had a story about all these top FBI luminaries. I mean, guys that oversaw [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  the Bureau's intelligence, counterterrorism, criminal training ops. They're the ones that said [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=178.56s)]
*  in modern history, the U.S. has never suffered an invasion of the homeland [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=185.04s)]
*  and yet one is happening now. And they went as far as to say that Joe Biden's policies of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  unleashed an invasion of military-age male foreigners who posed one of the most pernicious [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=196.88s)]
*  ever threats to American security. Now, excuse me, Governor, but if that's not a clear and present [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=203.12s)]
*  danger to every American safety and security, I don't know what is. Spot on, Sean. Let me tell [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=209.6s)]
*  you, I don't think there's anything that needs to get more coverage right now than that letter by [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=216.24s)]
*  those individuals who spent a lifetime protecting America and for them to come forward and say, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=221.84s)]
*  never before have we seen this type of activity, never before have we seen evidence of people who [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=229.12s)]
*  have harm on their minds to do to Americans freely coming into this country. And the shocking part [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=236.8s)]
*  about this, Sean, is that you have a president of the United States in the administration [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=244.16s)]
*  that seems to be helping them right along. We want to go cut the barter wire and let these people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=248.32s)]
*  freely come in and dilute this country. I'm stunned that Americans are not just up in arms, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=253.28s)]
*  literally, with what's going on and sending a clear message. This administration is, look, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=262.32s)]
*  if this is how you plan on getting reelected, good luck, my friend, because it's not going to happen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=269.76s)]
*  I honestly, I feel for law enforcement because I have so much respect for them, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=276.88s)]
*  but they have respect for each other. And the fact that border patrols come out so strongly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=281.36s)]
*  and so supportive of the efforts of Governor Abbott and the Guard and knowing darn well [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=286.56s)]
*  that Joe Biden created this crisis, I think has been pretty inspiring. Those governors that you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=293.76s)]
*  mentioned, every Republican governor has spoken out in defense of Texas. And I stand with Texas, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=300.08s)]
*  too. You once gave me the honor. I'm an honorary Texan governor. I have that document proudly [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=306.24s)]
*  displayed in my studio, and I really stand with the people of Texas tonight. This has got to stop. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  It's bad for the country. It always has been, and it's of Joe Biden's making. It's horrible. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=318.4s)]
*  Governor, good to see you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7-gGYSWhk&t=323.2s)]
