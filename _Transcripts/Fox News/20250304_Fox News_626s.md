# AG Pam Bondi vows to rid DOJ of 'worst of the worst'
**Fox News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI)
*  All right, this weekend, the Boston mayor epitomized exactly what is wrong with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=0.0s)]
*  woke left when it comes to crime. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=5.5s)]
*  Now, on Saturday night, a man with a knife chased two individuals in a crowded Chick-fil-A [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=7.08s)]
*  in Boston and was fatally shot by an off-duty police officer who was witnessing the incident, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  according to the police commissioner. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=18.04s)]
*  The officer identified himself, told the suspect to drop the weapon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  When the suspect did not comply, the officer discharged that weapon to stop the threat. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=24.22s)]
*  But when it was time for the Boston mayor, Michelle Wu, to speak, she expressed sympathy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=29.46s)]
*  for the knife-wielding suspect, but not the two individuals who were nearly stabbed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  My condolences and all of our thoughts are with the family of the individual whose life [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  has been lost. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  And I'm also thinking of all the people who were impacted here today in one of the busier [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=52.22s)]
*  parts of the city with this tragedy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  Then when asked about the backlash following her statement, Mayor Wu actually doubled down [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=64.42s)]
*  on stupid. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=70.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=71.62s)]
*  You know, it's unfortunate to politicize being at the scene of a tragic incident. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=72.62s)]
*  Our officers are in extremely difficult and dangerous situations every single day, keeping [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=81.94s)]
*  our residents safe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  And I express condolences along with our police commissioner and district attorney, because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=89.86s)]
*  every loss of life is a horrible tragedy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  Now, despite the incident, President Trump is making major headway on crime all across [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=100.5s)]
*  the country, according to a report from The New York Times. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=105.8s)]
*  on Mexico is now forcing the Mexican government to crack down on organized crime, forcing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=110.38s)]
*  cartels to shut down fentanyl production, and they are going into hiding. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=115.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi continues investigating the Epstein files [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=120.02s)]
*  and attempting to get a hold of the files that were never handed over from the FBI Bureau [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  in New York. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=131.94s)]
*  The attorney general, Pam Bondi, joins us now live on set. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=132.94s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=136.06s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=137.06s)]
*  Are you drowning yet? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=138.06s)]
*  How many weeks in? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=139.34s)]
*  Just a few. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=140.34s)]
*  Just a few. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=141.34s)]
*  Just a few. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=142.34s)]
*  Let me start with the Epstein case, because there was an expectation that this was going [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=143.34s)]
*  to be bigger. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=148.1s)]
*  You had the same expectation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  We all did. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=151.12s)]
*  And the FBI handed over a couple hundred pages of documents. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=152.46s)]
*  But you know, Sean, I gave them a deadline of Friday at 8 a.m. to get us everything, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=155.9s)]
*  and a source had told me where the documents were being kept. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=161.18s)]
*  Southern District of New York, shock. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=165.1s)]
*  So we got them all by hopefully all of them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=167.38s)]
*  Friday at 8 a.m., thousands of pages of documents. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=170.38s)]
*  I have the FBI going through them, and cash is also – now that we have cash here, it's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  a game changer, of course. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=177.5s)]
*  And cash is going to – Director Patel is going to get us a detailed report as to why [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=179.1s)]
*  the FBI withheld all of those documents. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=185.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=188.3s)]
*  I want to be clear, because I think people got frustrated, because they were expecting [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=189.3s)]
*  more. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=193.78s)]
*  And you didn't find out – less than 24 hours before the release, you got a whistleblower [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=195.78s)]
*  that confirmed that there were way more documents that they were supposed to turn over, and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  then you found out just before that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=206.74s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=208.62s)]
*  And you're looking at these documents going, these aren't all the Epstein files. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=209.62s)]
*  You know, they were flight logs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=212.82s)]
*  They were names and victims' names. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=214.22s)]
*  And we're going, where's the rest of the stuff? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's what the FBI had turned over to us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=218.58s)]
*  And so a source said, whoa, all this evidence is sitting in the Southern District of New [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=221.46s)]
*  York. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=226.18s)]
*  So based on that, I gave them the deadline. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=227.18s)]
*  Friday at 8, a truckload of evidence arrived. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=229.62s)]
*  It's now in the possession of the FBI. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=233.38s)]
*  Cash is going to get me and himself, really, a detailed report as to why all these documents [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=235.82s)]
*  and evidence had been withheld. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=241.5s)]
*  And you know, we're going to go through it, go through it as fast as we can, but go through [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=243.78s)]
*  very cautiously to protect all the victims of Epstein, because there are a lot of victims. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=248.42s)]
*  You had identified in phase one over 254. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=256.46s)]
*  Now, is that the only thing that would be redacted? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=257.46s)]
*  Will everything else be made public that you get in your possession? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=261.5s)]
*  Yeah, the FBI hasn't had, obviously, they haven't looked at the thousands of pages of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  documents that they've just received Friday. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=268.74s)]
*  But Cash has a team going through them, and it's always about protecting the victim. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=271.26s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=276.14000000000004s)]
*  We believe in transparency, and America has the right to know. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=277.22s)]
*  The Biden administration set on these documents. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  No one did anything with them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=283.38s)]
*  And why were they sitting in the Southern District of New York? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=284.62s)]
*  I want a full report on that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=286.94s)]
*  You know, sadly, these people don't believe in transparency. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=288.86s)]
*  But I think more, unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's a new day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=296.38s)]
*  It's a new administration. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  And everything's going to come out to the public. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=299.38s)]
*  The public has a right to know. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  Americans have a right to know. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=303.86s)]
*  And that goes the same with the JFK files, RFK files, MLK? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=305.78s)]
*  JFK, Martin Luther King, yep, absolutely. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=308.7s)]
*  What are the things that, and maybe some people don't understand the need to redact. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=310.58s)]
*  In the case of a victim, that should be pretty obvious to people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=314.74s)]
*  What are the other things that maybe you would have to redact? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=318.3s)]
*  National security? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=321.38s)]
*  No, of course, national security, some grand jury information, which is always going to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=322.38s)]
*  be confidential. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=326.1s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=327.1s)]
*  Let's look through them as fast as we can, get it out to the American people, because [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=328.1s)]
*  the American people have a right to know, not only on that, but on Kennedy, on Martin [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=333.42s)]
*  Luther King, on all of these cases that the Biden administration has just sat on for all [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  these years. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=343.22s)]
*  So, yeah, it's really, it's not sad. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=344.22s)]
*  It's infuriating that these people thought that they could sit on this information, but [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=348.82s)]
*  they can't. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=354.14s)]
*  It's a new day. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=355.14s)]
*  And we believe in transparency. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=356.14s)]
*  And it's going to come out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=358.14s)]
*  And when we redact things, Sean, what we're going to do is not just pull pages out like [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=359.44s)]
*  they used to do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=363.76s)]
*  If something's redacted, you will know the line and you will know why it's redacted, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=365.18s)]
*  a victim's name, identifying information of a victim. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=369.28s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the DOJ prior to your arrival. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=373.16s)]
*  I believe it was weaponized. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=379.2s)]
*  How do we prevent that from ever happening again? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=381.3s)]
*  I believe that once the FBI was the world's premier law enforcement agency, and that was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=386.16s)]
*  weaponized and politicized. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=391.04s)]
*  I believe the same with our intel community. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=392.5s)]
*  How do we restore these institutions to their former greatness? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=395.2s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, we got rid of the Jack Smith team. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=399.92s)]
*  Gone. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=403.32s)]
*  Those people are gone. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=404.32s)]
*  We're still trying to find out. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=405.44s)]
*  There are a lot of people in the FBI and also in the Department of Justice who despise Donald [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=408.12s)]
*  and don't want to be there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=415.08s)]
*  We will find them because you have to believe in transparency. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=416.8s)]
*  You have to believe in honesty. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=421.64s)]
*  You have to do the right thing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=422.96s)]
*  And right now we're going to root them out. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=424.2s)]
*  We will find them and they will no longer be employed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=425.64s)]
*  But again, we're starting at every level of the Justice Department, Sean, and getting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=429.0s)]
*  rid of the worst of the worst. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=433.04s)]
*  But there are a lot more people that shouldn't be there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=434.48s)]
*  But there are a lot of good people who are out there now risking their lives every day [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=437.44s)]
*  making these cases. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, today we made a huge case involving a Guatemalan, an illegal from Guatemala, one [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=444.44s)]
*  of the largest human trafficking rings in the country. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=450.56s)]
*  20,000 people being smuggled into this country from Guatemala. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  That arrest was made in California. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=457.96s)]
*  Last week an illegal was arrested in New York for ISIS, funding ISIS. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=460.24s)]
*  It's constant. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  We are going to get out there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to arrest the bad people, take them off the streets and restore the Justice [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=468.12s)]
*  Department to what it was made to do, fight violent crime. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=472.34s)]
*  Are you up to this point? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  I know it's very early in your tenure. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  A few weeks. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=481.46s)]
*  Are you at all shocked at how things were running before you got there? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=482.46s)]
*  Shocked. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=487.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=488.62s)]
*  Never thought, Cash and I, Patel, talk about this all the time. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=489.62s)]
*  You know, we knew it was bad. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=492.94s)]
*  We never knew how bad. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=494.17999999999995s)]
*  And especially on the criminal side and on the people who are in there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=496.05999999999995s)]
*  You've heard the story, of course. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=502.14s)]
*  I went up, I was visiting the floors. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  I walk up to the seventh floor of the national security and they still, I couldn't get in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=506.3s)]
*  there because it's a skiff. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=509.9s)]
*  That's how it was secure. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=511.94s)]
*  But my detail managed to get me in there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=513.74s)]
*  They still had a picture of Joe Biden on the wall in Kamala Harris. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=515.62s)]
*  That's how bad it was. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=519.3s)]
*  So I personally took those off the wall. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=520.98s)]
*  But that's the tip of the iceberg. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=523.86s)]
*  What about when you talk about people in the DOJ that have an awful lot of power and maybe [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=525.98s)]
*  what they did to Donald Trump is unprecedented. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=532.62s)]
*  Evaluation of Mar-a-Lago, the double standard with the rate of Mar-a-Lago, the FISA abuse, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=535.1s)]
*  Russia lie, a dirty misinformation dossier signed three times by a former FBI head, in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=541.18s)]
*  that case James Comey. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=547.66s)]
*  Are these all on the table to get to the bottom of overtime? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  Everything's on the table, Sean. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=553.1s)]
*  We're going to look at everything. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  And as I said, the Jack Smith team, gone. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=556.6999999999999s)]
*  That was low-hanging fruit, really. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  Get rid of them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=561.34s)]
*  Get rid of the people that raided the president's home in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=562.14s)]
*  Will we look into what they did? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=564.62s)]
*  Everything's being looked into. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=566.38s)]
*  Everything. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=568.06s)]
*  And right now we are hiring great lawyers, great people around us who we can trust. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=568.86s)]
*  Right now the numbers are very small. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=576.14s)]
*  But now that we have cash in, it's made it a lot easier at the FBI. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=578.54s)]
*  But he's dealing with what we're dealing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=581.98s)]
*  You know, the great men and women of DEA, ATF, the U.S. Marshals. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=583.98s)]
*  We're all working together to fight violent crime. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's a shame that a few people have given them such a bad name, as well as the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=593.0200000000001s)]
*  Department of Justice. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=598.7s)]
*  It sounds daunting. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=599.6600000000001s)]
*  It sounds like a massive list. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=600.7800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't sound like you're going to be sleeping a lot in the next four years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=602.22s)]
*  None of us will, but it's worth it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=605.74s)]
*  It's worth it to fight for the American people and to keep America safe. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=607.82s)]
*  Amen. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=612.46s)]
*  Pam, thank you for coming in. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=613.34s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=614.5400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=615.1s)]
*  You too. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=615.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMnYwDi2-BI&t=619.58s)]
