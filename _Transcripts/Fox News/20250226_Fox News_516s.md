# Dems treated Musk's Cabinet attendance like a 'five-alarm fire': Hannity
**Fox News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU)
*  Welcome to Hannity. And tonight, a big promotion for the man that you see in this iconic photo [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=0.0s)]
*  shielding Donald Trump at that fateful rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Sean Kern is now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=5.84s)]
*  the director of the U.S. Secret Service. He will join us for his very first cable interview [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=11.32s)]
*  tonight, but first, a brand new low for the media mob. What a shocker. Fake Jake, our [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=17.04s)]
*  old friend Tapper over at CNN. Fake News is now publishing a new book about Joe Biden's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=21.64s)]
*  steep cognitive decline and the cover-up that ensued. I do hope that Fake Jake remembered [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=28.0s)]
*  to write a chapter on himself. Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=34.6s)]
*  You are no ab- [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=37.84s)]
*  To watch somebody on stage search for questions. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=38.84s)]
*  It's so amazing. It's so amazing to me that- [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=39.84s)]
*  And try and figure out an answer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  A cognitive decline. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, when you're trying to tell me that what I was suggesting was a stuttering- [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I think that you were mocking his stutter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=48.0s)]
*  I haven't played Dan Joe Biden. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=49.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you were mocking his stutter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=50.0s)]
*  No, she wasn't mocking his stutter. We were playing it before the 2020 election. We have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  that full exchange coming up, but let's be clear. This book is coming out well after [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Biden's departure from the White House, so it's kind of meaningless until the Democratic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=61.64s)]
*  Party, of course, gave the green light to throw Joe Biden overboard. Well, Jake, along [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  with all of his friends at Fake News, CNN, MSDNC and the state-run legacy media mob and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  every other outlet in the country, you know, they covered for Joe Biden and his cognitive [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=76.84s)]
*  decline, even though it was so obvious to anyone with eyes to see the former president [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=82.04s)]
*  was mentally inept before the 2020 election. At one point, Biden went 11 straight months [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=86.84s)]
*  without holding a single cabinet meeting, not one. And when he did finally muster the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=92.42s)]
*  energy to convene a meeting at the White House, he quickly turned the event over to Dr. Joe [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=97.18s)]
*  Biden, who was sitting at the head of the table, just for memory's sake. Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=102.06s)]
*  It's just still morning, isn't it? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=106.9s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=109.9s)]
*  And so this cabinet meeting comes at a time when we're four months left in the administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to keep running through the tape because the vice president are determined [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  to keep making sure that the democracy delivers what the American people are asking for and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=121.9s)]
*  what we've provided. It means continuing to implement the historic laws we passed. They've [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=126.9s)]
*  allowed us to invest in America, rebuild our infrastructure, and implement our historic [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=132.9s)]
*  laws. So we're grateful that Jill is here today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=137.9s)]
*  Just stop and look at that. Just just look at that. He was president for four years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=143.5s)]
*  How did we ever allow that to happen? At the time, few in the media mob seemed to care. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=150.02s)]
*  They pretended this is all perfectly normal. They didn't even bat an eye when Hunter Biden [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=155.16s)]
*  started showing up at White House meetings. They never covered Joe's lies about, I never [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=159.74s)]
*  once discussed the foreign business dealings with Hunter, my brother or anybody for that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=165.18s)]
*  matter. We have pictures that prove that false. The people that, you know, he gave preemptive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  pardons to eventually. The very same thing he said was wrong if Donald Trump ever did [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=175.82s)]
*  it. They never covered the lying about the border being secure and closed or the economy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  and inflation. Well, how times have changed. Now it is a five alarm fire in the legacy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  state run media mob, all because Elon Musk, a special government employee in charge of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  Doge attended Donald Trump's first cabinet meeting. And by the way, what he said was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=197.44s)]
*  dead on accurate. And that is we cannot sustain ourselves as a country with the debt we are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=202.58s)]
*  taking on. Musk isn't selling access to America's adversaries while smoking crack, committing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=209.04s)]
*  gun crimes. And he is in cloud chasing community college cloud casing community college teacher [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=215.12s)]
*  masquerading and demanding to be called doctor. But Musk is the world's richest man with [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  an unprecedented track record surrounding innovation, business success, efficiency. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  So maybe the media mob should be crediting President Trump for bringing Elon into the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=232.62s)]
*  fold to save the average American that only makes 66 grand a year from having to waste [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=238.82s)]
*  their money on radical leftism abroad in the to the tune of tens and what it will be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=246.14s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. You know, it is the vitriol is nonstop as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=252.94s)]
*  President Trump, Elon Musk, the administration vilified for trying to be good stewards of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=259.62s)]
*  your hard earned money. Take a look. We're spending like over a trillion dollars on interest. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=265.7s)]
*  If this continues, the country will go become de facto bankrupt. It's not an optional thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=272.58s)]
*  It is an essential thing. That's that's the reason I'm here and taking a lot of flack [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=278.62s)]
*  and getting a lot of death threats, by the way. I mean, like second up, you know. But [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  if we don't do this, America will go bankrupt. That's why it has to be done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  De facto bankrupt. America will go bankrupt. We're robbing from our children and grandchildren. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=295.74s)]
*  So called Party of Compassion. They obviously don't care today on Capitol Hill. More fun [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=302.18s)]
*  fear mongering from elected Democrats. What a shock. Take a look. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  Welcome to the Elon Musk chainsaw massacre. Except for this remake of a classic is terrible [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=312.14s)]
*  because it's hurting real people and its lead character, Mr. Musk, hasn't shown up in front [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=319.58s)]
*  of this committee or Congress at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=326.0s)]
*  He'd be wasting his time. You wouldn't understand it. Anyway, we're going to play [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=330.14s)]
*  the worst of the worst coming up. But while Democrats continue to whine and moan and complain, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  big things are happening at the White House every single minute of every day. Today, after [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=339.24s)]
*  his Cabinet meeting, the president signed an executive order requiring government agencies [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=343.34s)]
*  to work with Doge to justify spending, limit travel, identify federal properties that can [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  be sold. And meanwhile, as the southern border becomes more and more secure in record time, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=354.3s)]
*  is turning his attention to America's convoluted legal immigration system. His first move was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=359.94s)]
*  the announcement of a brand new gold card, which will enable businesses, wealthy individuals [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=366.17999999999995s)]
*  after they get vetted to invest $5 million in the U.S. in exchange for a path to citizenship. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=372.7s)]
*  By the way, this is something many, many, many countries around the world, they all [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=379.9s)]
*  have these programs in place. Places like Australia, New Zealand, other countries, little [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=384.96s)]
*  cheaper. Want to live in the Caribbean somewhere? You can get a passport. You can buy one. The [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=389.78s)]
*  proceeds will be used to pay down the national debt. President Trump also negotiating a peace [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=394.34s)]
*  plan in Europe. And earlier this week, he successfully crafted a rare earth minerals [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=399.46s)]
*  deal with Ukraine. On Friday, President Zelensky will visit the White House to sign off on [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=405.26s)]
*  that deal. As Vice President J.D. Vance rightly pointed out, don't underestimate Trump's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=410.94s)]
*  ability to get important things across the finish line. You know, maybe if the media and Democrats [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=416.41999999999996s)]
*  waited for some results, they won't sound so stupid all the time. Take a look. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=422.02s)]
*  As the president said, we're not going to do the negotiation in public with the American media. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=426.82s)]
*  He's going to do it in private with the president of Russia, with the president of Ukraine and with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  other leaders. And I think that's how this has to go. I think that I just want to push back against [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  some of the criticism I've seen in the administration on this, because every single time [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=442.18s)]
*  the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=446.66s)]
*  He hasn't conceded anything to anyone. He's doing the job of a diplomat. And he is, of course, the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=452.26s)]
*  diplomat and chief. Unlike the last president, Donald Trump is working around the clock, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=457.62s)]
*  thinking outside the box. He's thinking differently. In other words, business as usual [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=463.7s)]
*  is over. That's a good thing. And he's keeping his promises. And he wants to improve the quality [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=469.46s)]
*  of life for all of you, every American. And even to top it off today, more meetings at the White [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=474.41999999999996s)]
*  House as Trump navigates a critical budget deal that will restore fiscal sanity to the Washington [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  swamp. Just today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced, look at the 60 billion, billion [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=485.46s)]
*  in savings at the State Department on top of the estimated 65 billion in Doge savings. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=492.17999999999995s)]
*  Moments ago, Speaker Johnson wrapped up a meeting with Elon Musk as a budget deal is now hanging in the balance. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgeOXxJTNU&t=499.14s)]
