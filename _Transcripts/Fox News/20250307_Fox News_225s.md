# Gov. Greg Abbott: Trump is showing there are consequences to this
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM)
*  Vice President J.D. Vance, by the way, he was at the southern border today in the great state of Texas along with Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hickseth and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=6.48s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Colt Tulsi Gabbard [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  They all flew down from DC together where they were greeted by our friend Texas Governor Greg Abbott who joined them [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  On their border tour Governor Abbott joins us right now with more governor great to see you again [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=16.84s)]
*  I've had the pleasure of doing that how'd it go today? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=21.76s)]
*  Listen went well for one it's great to have a vice president who actually comes to the border and sees what's going on in the border [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=24.08s)]
*  I guess to see firsthand what the Border Patrol is doing and how to secure the border [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  They went to that part that you had the interview with President Trump and myself that we wired completely shut [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  So they got to see what what Texas had been doing they were able to inquire about what was working what was not working [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=38.8s)]
*  We reveled in some new numbers that just came out for the month of February about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  All-time record lows and the illegal crossings at our border [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=48.64s)]
*  But here's the deal in a private meeting with the vice president [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=52.0s)]
*  He celebrated the the record low number that we have set but he went around the room asking [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=55.88s)]
*  What can we do to cut that in half then cut it in half again then cut it half again in other words? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=62.64s)]
*  The vice president and the president they're happy that they're making a difference [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  But they're not satisfied because they want to make sure that we do even more to go to the border [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=71.04s)]
*  Because they want to make sure that we do even more to get that border secure [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=76.44000000000001s)]
*  You know governor, I don't think anybody knows like you do because you've been on the front lines from day one [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=79.72s)]
*  And we went through four years where your government was suing you coming after you attacking you and you you had to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=87.12s)]
*  Take Texas taxpayer dollars and do their job [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=95.04s)]
*  What is the difference between then and then and now and they were lying and telling us the border secure we knew better [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=99.76s)]
*  Well, then they lied about something else Sean that they lied saying that they needed new laws to be able to secure the border [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=106.64s)]
*  President Trump was exactly right last night when he said we just needed a new president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=112.2s)]
*  and so what they're doing is they're being very effective at making sure that the people do not cross the border and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  To show how effective it is of those who the few who actually do cross the border [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=123.28s)]
*  99% of them are actually returned back across the border or to whatever country they came from and so [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is showing there are consequences when you enter this country illegally [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=135.73999999999998s)]
*  And we will catch you and we will send you back to where you came from [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=140.05999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so what is the next step? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean now that you have the help and support of the vice president and the president and Tom Homan and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=147.38s)]
*  Kristi Noem and and everybody in the administration and cash Patel and and Pam Bondi. What would you like to see next? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, so you talked about the lineup and there's a reason why everybody in that line up has a role to play [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=161.94s)]
*  One thing we talked about in our roundtable today was the necessity of being able to take legal action [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Which obviously would involve Pam Bondi and the AG there was a reason why the Secretary of Defense [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  Hexeth was there because there's a military component to what we're doing a reason why the DNI was there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  The DNI was there because think of all the known terrorists who have come across the border illegally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=185.7s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, we got to find them and arrest them and put them behind bars [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=192.5s)]
*  Yeah, all right governor. We always appreciate you bet. What did you and governor de santis bet best? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=198.05999999999997s)]
*  Political jiu-jitsu move of all time you send illegals to all the sanctuary cities and states brilliant [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  I wish I was that smart great job [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  You [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR90wKrCZgM&t=215.14s)]
