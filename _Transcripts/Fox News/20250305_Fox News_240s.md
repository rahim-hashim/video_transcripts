# Mother of Jocelyn Nungaray calls out Dems for acting ‘cowardly’
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4)
*  All right, joining us now is Jocelyn's mother, Alexis Nungary is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexis, it's great to have you back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=5.76s)]
*  I think so much of you, and I've spoken to you a number of times, and I had you and your [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=8.6s)]
*  dad on this program with Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  How did you feel, number one, when you got this great honor for your very brave daughter? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And what did you think of the Democrats? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=24.68s)]
*  It was truly an honor, a very surreal feeling to be sitting in that area to remember the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=29.0s)]
*  life that Jocelyn had. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=39.92s)]
*  I found it very cowardly that a lot of the Democrats didn't stand, didn't clap, didn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=42.56s)]
*  do anything to support anything that Donald Trump is trying to do as president to make [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=49.04s)]
*  this country better. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  It was very shameful to the Democrats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, I mean, this is your precious 12-year-old girl. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  And I looked at Lake and Riley's mom, and she's tearing up, and she's fighting back [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=63.68s)]
*  tears. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=70.08s)]
*  And we see this 13-year-old young man who became a member of the Secret Service with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=71.08s)]
*  Sean Curran tonight, the new head of the Secret Service, which was a really special moment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=76.12s)]
*  This young man makes it into West Point tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=80.96s)]
*  All these incredible Americana optics that anybody with a heart, mind, body and soul [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=83.68s)]
*  would love. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=90.68s)]
*  Your little daughter fought off these brutal, vicious, vile, evil attackers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  I can't even imagine how she did. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=99.2s)]
*  And I know, I just, my faith tells me I know where she is, and I know you will be with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=102.84s)]
*  her again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=110.0s)]
*  If they can't stand and applaud you and stand up for the right of innocent people like your [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=111.56s)]
*  daughter, what does that party stand for? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=119.56s)]
*  I've found it repulsive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  They don't stand for anything humane. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=124.84s)]
*  They don't stand for us as citizens. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  They don't stand for our security. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=129.58s)]
*  They don't stand for honorable things that we need in this country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=131.04s)]
*  And it's just, it's very disgraceful to us as U.S. citizens that those are the people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  that we have here in Congress, in House and Senate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=141.88s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=145.32s)]
*  I don't think you ever thought you'd be involved in politics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you ever thought you'd lose your daughter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=149.72s)]
*  But I think now you probably have a good sense of how politics works here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=152.26s)]
*  How many times, for example, have you met and spoken with Donald Trump? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=159.86s)]
*  Did you ever hear from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  I have met and spoken with President Donald Trump several times, and every time has been [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  very humane, very fatherly, very caring, compassionate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=176.64s)]
*  And I've heard zero effort, zero of anything from the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, not one time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=188.76s)]
*  They never picked up a phone call. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  How, you know, I can only, people can only try to imagine what you feel and being in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=193.24s)]
*  your position. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=202.4s)]
*  You never overcome something like this, do you? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=203.6s)]
*  No, the pain doesn't go away. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=206.64s)]
*  The hole doesn't fill. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=209.64s)]
*  It just, you learn to deal with it more. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=212.6s)]
*  But I am clinging onto my faith in Christ and Jesus, and He is who's getting me through [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=214.98s)]
*  with His strength. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=220.28s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=221.28s)]
*  Amen, Alexis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=222.56s)]
*  We're praying with you and for you and for your daughter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=223.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6-i1EDba4&t=226.36s)]
