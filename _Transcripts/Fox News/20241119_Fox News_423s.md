# Sean Hannity: The abuse of power in government will end
**Fox News:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0)
*  Land of the free, home of the brave, well, has now become, in liberal land, the land [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=0.0s)]
*  of the woke snowflake. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=5.96s)]
*  Look, don't you just hate to see liberals turning on each other like this? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=7.72s)]
*  So sad to see. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=12.36s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome is taking its toll, speaking of which, tonight we have more big [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=13.68s)]
*  news from the president-elect and bad news for the radical left. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=18.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is assembling his new administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=21.8s)]
*  He is doing it in record time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=24.8s)]
*  According to an ABC News report, he is making appointments, nominations, in, quote, a quarter [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=26.32s)]
*  of the time it has taken some of his predecessors. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=31.58s)]
*  Coming up, two of those appointments will join us live, including the soon-to-be deputy [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=35.68s)]
*  chief of policy, Stephen Miller, along with the incoming press secretary—I wouldn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=39.64s)]
*  wish this job on anybody—Caroline Leavitt, although I do have suggestions for her. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  After four long years of circle-back Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre, change is coming to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=48.96s)]
*  the White House briefing room. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=55.36s)]
*  By the way, what a great idea that R.A. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=56.68s)]
*  Fleischer had. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=60.0s)]
*  He said, put new media, put talk radio, Fox News, put, you know, people in podcasting, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=61.0s)]
*  put them in the front rows and take the legacy hate Trump media in the back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=67.16s)]
*  Their influence is dead anyway. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=72.06s)]
*  They had 90 percent negative coverage of Donald Trump, 90 percent positive for Kamala. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=73.8s)]
*  Trump still won in a landslide. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=79.12s)]
*  Nobody cares what they say. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=81.08s)]
*  And now change is coming to every facet of our federal government. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=83.48s)]
*  Might as well do it there as well. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  And whether the legacy media, the radical left like it or not, it's happening. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=88.92s)]
*  Moments ago, Donald Trump announced that American business mogul and small business administrator [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=92.72s)]
*  Linda McMahon will be appointed to lead the Department of Education, which might cease [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=98.2s)]
*  to exist by the end of Trump's term. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=102.76s)]
*  Now, that's great. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=107.68s)]
*  Because state and local governments know better how to raise their children, and there should [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=108.68s)]
*  be national requirements that they must meet. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=113.28s)]
*  Our friend Dr. Mehmet Oz, he has been nominated to be the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=115.88s)]
*  which Donald Trump has promised to protect, where he will work closely with Robert F. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=122.08s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=126.52s)]
*  That'll be a great one-two punch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=127.52s)]
*  Dan Scavino is back. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=129.6s)]
*  He has been picked to be Trump's deputy chief of staff. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  Good choice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=133.72s)]
*  According to reports, Vice President-elect Vance has also confirmed that Trump is interviewing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=134.72s)]
*  candidates to replace Chris Wray at the FBI. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=139.56s)]
*  Now, Wray had an opportunity after Comey, I spoke about it often, to restore the reputation, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=143.12s)]
*  the former greatness, the integrity to the FBI, which continued to operate in a very [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=149.72s)]
*  hyperpartisan manner under his watch. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=155.12s)]
*  So Chris Wray's time as FBI director is now running short. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=157.88s)]
*  In fact, far-left politically motivated bureaucrats from all across the federal government, they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=161.96s)]
*  should know that their reign of oppression on the American people is about to end. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  The witch hunts will end. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  The leaking will end. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=175.64s)]
*  The abuse of power, the corruption will end. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=176.64s)]
*  The so-called resistance within our government against we the people will be over. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=179.2s)]
*  Donald Trump has nominated a team of disruptors like he said he would. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  They are hell-bent on reforming every single department. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=188.92s)]
*  Look at what Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=193.64s)]
*  Waste, fraud, abuse will be gutted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  Constitutional order. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=200.16s)]
*  Remember, the principles of limited government, greater freedom, they will be restored. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  You won't have the nanny state, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, promises of the left [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=207.32s)]
*  that would never be realized anyway, that always result in broken promises, more poverty [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  and a loss of freedom. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=218.5s)]
*  The DOJ must no longer ever, ever be weaponized. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  We can't live in that country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=224.44s)]
*  And institutions, great institutions like the FBI and our intelligence communities, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=226.28s)]
*  they need to be restored to their former greatness. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=231.76s)]
*  Under Donald Trump they will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=234.16s)]
*  And despite what you hear from the hysterical legacy media, the incoming administration [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=235.76s)]
*  is confident Trump's cabinet will get confirmed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=240.92s)]
*  Not only will Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but the president-elect is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=244.0s)]
*  also ready and willing to use another tool at his disposal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=249.12s)]
*  It is not the ideal way to do it, but if he has to, he will, like other presidents have. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=253.32s)]
*  It's called recess appointments. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=258.08s)]
*  And like everything else that Donald Trump does, this will send the left, the state-run [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=260.12s)]
*  legacy media mob, into a fit of hysteria. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=265.2s)]
*  Here are some facts. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=268.48s)]
*  Let's look at Reuters as the source, shall we? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=269.48s)]
*  The U.S. Constitution says that a president can make recess appointments to fill vacant [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=271.96s)]
*  positions when the Senate is not in session. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=277.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled that a president can make those appointments once the Senate has [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=280.68s)]
*  been adjourned for at least 10 days. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=285.3s)]
*  The first ever recess appointment? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=287.4s)]
*  Well, that was made by the first president himself, George Washington, during the very [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=289.12s)]
*  first congressional recess in 1790. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=293.88s)]
*  More recently, Ronald Reagan made 240 recess appointments. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=297.12s)]
*  President George H.W. Bush made 77 recess appointments, including as secretary of state. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=302.36s)]
*  Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=308.6s)]
*  George W. Bush, 171. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  Barack Obama, 32. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  So, this Thanksgiving, if you're sitting with your liberal relatives and they're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  not throwing turkey legs or mashed potatoes at you and they are freaking out, you can [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=322.04s)]
*  present them with these simple, basic, fundamental facts and truth. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=326.6s)]
*  Presidents from both parties have made hundreds of recess appointments. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  It will not be unusual. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=335.54s)]
*  It will not be unlawful for Donald Trump to do the same. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  So tonight, we can all feel very good about Donald Trump's incoming cabinet. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=340.32s)]
*  They are about to clean house in the Washington swamp. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=344.6s)]
*  There is, you know, little that anyone on the radical extreme left can do about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=348.48s)]
*  And of course, that won't stop them from screaming, yelling and crying and trying. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=353.0s)]
*  But they're manufactured hysteria. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  It didn't work during the election. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not going to work now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  It's sort of like it all comes together. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=362.56s)]
*  It's just one big nine-year period of, you know, breathless, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=365.28s)]
*  And the American people rejected that overwhelmingly in the election. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=371.84s)]
*  Woke cancel culture is now about to die. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=375.84s)]
*  Americans are over it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  They no longer listen to the media. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=381.28s)]
*  They don't care what Hollywood celebrities have to say, which is great news. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=383.48s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney could go back and focus on counting their money. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=387.44s)]
*  Americans want the American dream restored for everybody else with freedom and justice [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=392.96s)]
*  and prosperity and equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws for everybody, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  along with a border that is secure, streets that are safe, lower grocery prices and lower [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  gas prices. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmAc6sXlh0&t=409.71999999999997s)]
