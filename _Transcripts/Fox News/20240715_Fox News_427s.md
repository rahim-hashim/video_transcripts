# Dana Perino: The American public wonâ€™t stand for this
**Fox News:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk)
*  All right now joining us now is the co-host of America's newsroom and the hit show the five and a personal friend and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=0.0s)]
*  Probably along with David Portnoy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=7.96s)]
*  The biggest advocate for dogs in America and the host of America's newsroom Dana Perino Dana great to have you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  pizza [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=17.68s)]
*  Well, do you like pizza as much as pork? No, I don't know. You know, I just love Portnoy [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  You know an alpha male miss peaches. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen so [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=25.16s)]
*  Let's let's talk a little bit because there's a serious topic on the table here and that is the safety security of elected officials [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  And you worked in administration, you know what goes on behind the scenes and we're gonna get into more detail later [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=38.76s)]
*  The one question I have is how is it possible that a shooter got on a roof? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Less than 200 yards away with a rifle and we didn't know that how did that happen? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=51.2s)]
*  So specifically I do not know I believe that the investigation will [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=57.84s)]
*  Tell us that I hope that it is much [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  More quickly done than the JFK assassination investigation Sean that took 44 weeks [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=66.36s)]
*  To get done and I don't think that the American public will stand for that in this moment. But Sean last [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=72.16s)]
*  September I was in Los Angeles had an opportunity to co-host [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=79.24s)]
*  Co-moderate the Republican presidential debate there and there are seven candidates on there [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  I just remember one of the questions I said was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=88.88s)]
*  The farther we get from September 11th the closer we get to September 10th [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  What I think happened overall in a big picture point of way is that we are now living with a September 10th mentality [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  Remember one of the things that happened on September 10th [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=105.2s)]
*  And because and then on September 11th is that law enforcement and intelligence were not talking to each other. There wasn't clear communication [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=108.56s)]
*  So they had to deal with that. So now we get away from that. We've been fortunate. We've done a lot of good work [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  We've worked with partners. We've killed a lot of terrorists [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  But now we actually have other problems here that you have in law enforcement [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=124.12s)]
*  maybe lacks not paying enough attention may be focused on other things that they shouldn't supposed to be and you have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=128.64s)]
*  Opened border for the last three and a half years which adds to the uncertainty and the terrifying thing to me is that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  we are in a very vulnerable [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=142.36s)]
*  situation at a time when our [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Expectations for what we need from America and Americans as the most exceptional country [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=147.8s)]
*  We need to do better for our own citizens [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=152.56s)]
*  But it's important for us to be the leader of the free world and I don't think that we look very good in this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank goodness president Trump had the presence of mind and the instincts to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=162.08s)]
*  Insist to the Secret Service that he had a chance to rise up and and tell everyone he was okay and to give that defiance [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  And that warrior president mentality [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  But I feel like if whether he wins the election or president Biden continues or if it's somebody else [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=176.12s)]
*  We have got to get back to thinking like we did on September 11th in the afternoon [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=181.96s)]
*  Not like September 10th [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Let me let me ask you this you talk about a September 10th mentality and that is a very sobering thought Dana and I think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, I believe you're right and an issue that we have discussed here many of us on Fox [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  I know you do on on your show America's newsroom and on on the five and that is the issue of immigration [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  It is ink. I have no understanding at all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  Why 11 million? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants have been allowed into this country from nearly 180 countries from [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=212.96s)]
*  countries with terror ties our top geopolitical foes Dana Iran Syria Afghanistan [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=220.56s)]
*  Venezuela Egypt tens of thousands from China and Russia [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Can you explain that because I'm making the prediction that is not if it is a hundred percent when we're gonna get hit again [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=234.68s)]
*  And I remember 9-eleven like it was yesterday, but I do always add I prayed to God that I'm wrong [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  But I know in my heart. I'm not we want to be right [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=250.64s)]
*  so one of the things that president Bush would say to us and other presidents have since said it and it's correct is that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=251.16s)]
*  If you want to harm this country, you only have to be right once [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=257.44s)]
*  our law enforcement and intelligence officials and citizens need to be right a hundred percent of the time and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=262.24s)]
*  yesterday [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=269.52s)]
*  Sean such [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=270.44s)]
*  It was so close to being a very different conversation tonight [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  And one of the things I was telling you earlier is I as I was brushing my teeth last night before bed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=276.44s)]
*  I was looking at myself in the mirror and then I'd look to the side and then look back then look to the side and realize [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  that's how close we were to losing former President Trump and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=285.76s)]
*  The reality of that hopefully is a galvanizing moment for all of us to say, okay [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=291.84s)]
*  President Biden says we need to be unified. It starts with us. I hope it also that he feels that it starts with him [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=298.12s)]
*  I'm on board. I want us to be more unified. I'd like to have some more policy debates about the border or about economics [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=304.32s)]
*  About foreign policy. Let's have those debates and take the personal out of it. I think that we're willing to do that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Is the other side? I don't I don't know I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=317.8s)]
*  you know you said something and now I just want to I want to hone in on this a little bit here and that is a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=320.72s)]
*  September 10th mentality in this in this context [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=326.72s)]
*  we've been told for three plus years that the border secure and the borders closed and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=330.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, we can watch what's happening and they just flat-out denied it to us or they flip it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  And then they blame Donald Trump even though they had bragged about getting rid of Trump policies that were effective [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=341.12s)]
*  And I'm just thinking that this is to me [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=345.6s)]
*  The single greatest national security threat in a lifetime Dana and I'm sitting here [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=349.48s)]
*  It's like you're watching a train wreck about to happen and nobody's nobody's paying attention [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=354.78s)]
*  And I have a hard time understanding why they would ever allow that to happen. Do you have any idea why I? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=359.26s)]
*  Part of me feels that it was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=368.05999999999995s)]
*  Really because they wanted to reverse anything president Trump had done right that like the blindness [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=370.41999999999996s)]
*  The policy was to just erase any sort of border [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=375.58s)]
*  Policy that President Trump had right so on the in the very first month president Biden did all of that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=380.38s)]
*  And then they were so stubborn and not only that we have reporting from Politico that said once immigration became such a political [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=384.7s)]
*  Problem that everybody in the cabinet just tossed it around like a hot potato. Nobody wanted to deal with it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=392.02s)]
*  And you have my orcas who's infuriating right when he says the borders closed. It's obviously not we got big problems Sean [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=397.82s)]
*  But I'm honored to be here with you and all the team tonight, and this is gonna be an amazing week [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgI4o2ajfk&t=403.82s)]
