# Jim Jordan calls on DOJ to share Biden special counsel evidence with Congress
**Fox News:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo)
*  All right, former President Donald Trump was in Atlanta today for a fundraiser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was asked by reporters about the election interference case and Fonny Willis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=5.24s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=10.6s)]
*  Well, I think that case has been totally discredited. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=11.6s)]
*  It was a money-making scheme on behalf of her and her lover, Wade, Mr. and Mrs. Wade. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=14.36s)]
*  And I think the case has been totally discredited, I would hope it seems to be. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=22.2s)]
*  And we'll see how that and the one in New York is totally discredited. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=26.64s)]
*  Every legal scholar said they have to obey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=29.64s)]
*  It's a horrible thing, but it's election interference. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=31.64s)]
*  Fonny, in full Get Trump mode, is asking the appeals court to deny the former president's request [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=36.64s)]
*  to overturn Judge McAfee's earlier decision to allow her to remain on the case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=41.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, Fonny Willis may be in some additional legal trouble. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=46.64s)]
*  According to a new report, the DOJ has now uncovered inconsistencies in Willis' use of federal grant money [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=51.64s)]
*  and in Washington, well, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and James Comer of the Oversight Committee, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=58.64s)]
*  they have threatened to hold Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress after the DOJ refused to turn over [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=64.64s)]
*  subpoenaed recordings of special counsel Herr's interview with Joe Biden. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=70.64s)]
*  Here now with more, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=76.64s)]
*  Let's start with that last part first. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=80.64s)]
*  Merrick Garland had till noon on Monday to turn over the interview. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=82.64s)]
*  The transcripts, the videos, whatever they had of Robert Herr's interview with Joe Biden. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=87.64s)]
*  He failed to comply with it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=93.64s)]
*  A guy by the name of Peter Navarro is now spending four months in prison for contempt of Congress. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=95.64s)]
*  Yeah. So never forget the facts here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=102.64s)]
*  Robert Herr's report said that Joe Biden knowingly kept and disclosed classified information. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=104.64s)]
*  He said that the reason he did that, at page 231, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=110.64s)]
*  Joe Biden had strong motivations to ignore classified procedures because he was writing a book, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=114.64s)]
*  a book for which he got paid $8 million. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=120.64s)]
*  So we have motive, 8 million reasons why, we have motive, we have the elements of the crime being met. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=123.64s)]
*  He knew the facts, he disclosed it, and he kept that information, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=129.64s)]
*  but he doesn't get charged because Robert Herr says he's a forgetful old man. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=133.64s)]
*  So we think it's incumbent upon the Justice Department to give us all that evidence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=137.64s)]
*  We would like to hear the audio tapes, and frankly, I think the American people would like to know here, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=142.64s)]
*  six months before the most important election we have, who's going to be our next commander in chief. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=147.64s)]
*  It's beyond that because Robert Herr did say that Joe Biden willfully withheld these documents. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=152.64s)]
*  They were found, you know, in what? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=160.64s)]
*  Really eight separate locations, but multiple locations within one location. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=163.64s)]
*  Depending on how you count it, that's fine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=167.64s)]
*  But didn't that report also say that Joe Biden told the ghostwriter, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=169.64s)]
*  I found some new materials down in my basement, let me read it to you? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=175.64s)]
*  Did that guy have a security clearance to have top secret information read to him by the former vice president? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=181.64s)]
*  And by the way, that same guy we wanted to post him to, we've asked for that, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=188.64s)]
*  and that same guy tried to destroy the evidence after he found out his special counsel had been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=192.64s)]
*  named. So yeah, Joe Biden met the elements of the crime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=198.64s)]
*  Joe Biden, we have motive, but he's not charged because he's forgetful old man. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=202.64s)]
*  But what's interesting here, Sean, is in the last three presidential elections, only there's only been three candidates, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=207.64s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, President Trump and President Biden. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=212.64s)]
*  All three had concerns. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=214.64s)]
*  Concerns were raised about how they dealt with classified information, but only one is being charged. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=216.64s)]
*  Joe Biden wasn't charged. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=221.64s)]
*  Hillary Clinton wasn't charged, even though she destroyed 30,000 emails, for goodness sake, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=223.64s)]
*  and was sending classified information over an unsecure server. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=227.64s)]
*  She's not charged, but somehow the one guy who was actually president at the time, he gets charged. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=230.64s)]
*  That's what so many Americans find wrong, because it is wrong. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=235.64s)]
*  It's a double standard, and that's not the way it's supposed to work in our great country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=239.64s)]
*  So I talked earlier in my monologue tonight about how Democrats can't run on their success [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=244.64s)]
*  or if you're better off than you were four years ago, and they're now resorting to radical rhetoric [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=250.64s)]
*  like, Donald Trump's going to kill Americans and bring slavery back and end all abortion in the country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=256.64s)]
*  That's because they're desperate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=264.64s)]
*  But on the other hand, we've got another issue here, and that is, okay, starting on Monday, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=267.64s)]
*  you've got this ridiculous case going back to 2015 and 16 involving Stormy Daniels. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=272.64s)]
*  In that case, the DA in New York, Alvin Bragg, has not even identified what the felony is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=279.64s)]
*  that they're actually charging Trump with. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=285.64s)]
*  Clearly, it's a biased judge, a jurisdiction not friendly to Trump, nor would DC be one, nor would Fulton County be one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=288.64s)]
*  And at what point do we say, wait a minute, this is April, we got an election in November. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=297.64s)]
*  Why don't we let the American people decide? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=303.64s)]
*  And how is it that the Biden Department of Justice won't cooperate with you, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=305.64s)]
*  but they're using every tool at their disposal to use the law to go after Biden's chief opponent? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=310.64s)]
*  How do you explain that? What does that say about the country? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=317.64s)]
*  That's today's left. Today's left controls the Democrat Party. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=320.64s)]
*  They've used this lawfare to go after their political opponent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=323.64s)]
*  But the good news is the American people see through it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=326.64s)]
*  President Trump's numbers continue to rise. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=328.64s)]
*  They know the case in New York with Alvin Bragg. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=330.64s)]
*  They know Fonny Willis in Georgia, and they know Jack Smith. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=332.64s)]
*  But both his cases, whether it's Miami or DC, are ridiculous. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=335.64s)]
*  Everyone knows it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=338.64s)]
*  It's why he's winning in all seven of the toss up states, the states that determine the election. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=339.64s)]
*  He's winning in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=345.64s)]
*  And those are the states that decide this election. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=350.64s)]
*  So that is the good news that I think we're going to have Donald Trump back in the White House [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=352.64s)]
*  because the country sees all this for what it is. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=356.64s)]
*  And they appreciate what they had under President Trump compared to what we've had with Joe Biden. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=358.64s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. They arrest him, they mugshot him, they arraign him, they charge him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=365.64s)]
*  His poll numbers go up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=370.64s)]
*  You have to wonder, if he gets convicted in New York, do his poll numbers go up? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=372.64s)]
*  So far, he defies all conventional political gravity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=377.64s)]
*  That would not shock me. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=381.64s)]
*  Jim Jordan, thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=383.64s)]
*  Where else? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mApMw-pYMbo&t=395.64s)]
