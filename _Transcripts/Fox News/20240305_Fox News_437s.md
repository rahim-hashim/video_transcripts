# Matt Gaetz: There is something very revealing about Hunter Biden's testimony
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA)
*  All right, so when the transcript of Hunter Biden's deposition before the House impeachment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=0.0s)]
*  inquiry was released, one thing that stood out right away was his interactions with Florida [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=4.64s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz, who questioned Hunter about his drug use, which prompted a healthy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=10.02s)]
*  dose of feigned outrage from Hunter, as you see there on your screen, with Hunter replying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=15.36s)]
*  to Gaetz, quote, of all the people sitting around this table, do you think that's appropriate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  to ask me? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=26.26s)]
*  And this later exchange didn't get much coverage, but take a look, Hunter says to Gaetz, quote, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=27.72s)]
*  I contemplate that one day you and I are going to be great friends. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=32.4s)]
*  Is that ever going to happen, Mr. Gaetz? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=39.36s)]
*  Gaetz responded, saying, hope springs eternal, Mr. Biden. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=40.36s)]
*  And now, according to Miranda Devine at the New York Post, a Chinese CEFC employee who [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=43.96s)]
*  allegedly paid Hunter $1 million for a legal retainer is now saying he's going to sue [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=48.96s)]
*  in seven days if he doesn't get the money back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=54.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=57.3s)]
*  Because Hunter, he says, never did any legal work for him at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=58.3s)]
*  Here was reaction as Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=62.86s)]
*  What I found particularly interesting about the exchange, remember, he was saying that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=65.58s)]
*  he was either drunk or high, but definitely out of his mind as it relates to the WhatsApp [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=70.36s)]
*  message, the one where he says, oh, I'm sitting here with my father and then threatening [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=75.42s)]
*  the CEFC executive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=80.26s)]
*  According to James Comer, millions of dollars goes to one of the bank accounts they have. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=82.96s)]
*  He doesn't remember sending that message. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't remember even if he sent that message, but he knows with 100% certainty [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=91.44s)]
*  that the message that they did send, that we now know about, that his father wasn't [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=97.52s)]
*  there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=103.8s)]
*  Now, if he doesn't remember anything else about it, doesn't remember sending it, says [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=104.8s)]
*  he was out of his mind high on drugs or drunk, how could he possibly remember the fact about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=108.88s)]
*  his father not being there? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=114.44s)]
*  Isn't it convenient that all Hunter Biden seems to remember is that he was high and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=118.84s)]
*  not with Joe Biden? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=123.36s)]
*  There's something very revealing about Hunter Biden's testimony, though. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=125.32s)]
*  Whenever he's getting paid, he suggests that he's a brilliant lawyer, a financial [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=128.76s)]
*  wizard, a man about Washington. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=133.6s)]
*  But whenever he's demanding payment, and that's where you see the references to Joe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=135.6s)]
*  Biden, the shakedowns, the threats, well, then he can't be responsible for his actions [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=139.4s)]
*  because he's just a drug-addled fool. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=144.88s)]
*  And so I wanted to drill into precisely when Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were using this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  drug-induced defense for really what is a bribe that is dressed up in drag and masquerading [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=153.12s)]
*  around as a business transaction. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  And the fact that the Chinese are now saying this wasn't a business transaction, there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=163.4s)]
*  was no work done, that only reinforces the concept that this was a bribe the whole time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=167.32s)]
*  All right, so we're supposed to believe that Hunter, who went on Good Morning America, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=172.52s)]
*  admitted he had no experience in energy, oil, gas at all or any experience in Ukraine. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  He's doing these big energy deals with Barisma out of Ukraine and the CEFC, the oil conglomerate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=184.84s)]
*  out of China. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=191.52s)]
*  Now, at a time when he's also addicted to drugs by his own admission. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain to me how dangerous that would be for national security? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=197.36s)]
*  Because I would imagine that especially the communist Chinese or Russian oligarchs he [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  did business with would likely have a dossier on him that could be very compromising. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=206.44s)]
*  Well, this was all about leverage to the Chinese, to the Ukrainians. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=213.96s)]
*  And here's what's so fascinating. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=219.08s)]
*  When we asked Hunter Biden, well, since you knew nothing about energy, why were you getting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=221.24s)]
*  paid a million bucks a year to be on the Barisma board? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=224.16s)]
*  And he said, well, I was an expert at compliance and oversight, and I was there to make sure [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=226.96s)]
*  the company was sufficiently transparent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  And so my brilliant colleague Harriet Hagerman of Wyoming, she said, well, if what you were [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  in charge of was transparency and oversight, were you ever transparent enough to share [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=238.8s)]
*  with the people who you sat in fiduciary for that you were on drugs, that you were high, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=244.56s)]
*  that you weren't doing that job? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  And of course, then, you know, Hunter Biden got very pious and suggested that it was rude [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  to ask anyone afflicted with addiction these questions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember, Hunter Biden is not a fool. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=259.2s)]
*  He's a crook. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=261.72s)]
*  And those crimes, in order to the benefit of many members of the Biden family, I believe [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  a bribe is consummated if family members are paid off. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=267.64s)]
*  I believe that should be the standard for impeachment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=271.8s)]
*  And I believe it's why we should send a criminal referral to the Justice Department for these [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=274.44s)]
*  things. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=278.88s)]
*  Because remember, Sean, the statute of limitations on a lot of this hasn't run. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=279.88s)]
*  If we send a criminal referral now, that will be a live bullet that the Trump Justice Department [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=283.2s)]
*  can chamber and discharge in order to get justice for the crimes of the Biden family, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=289.04s)]
*  notably Hunter. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=294.12s)]
*  Were you able to find any specific services rendered, for example, anything that he might [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=295.12s)]
*  have written to any of these companies that were paying him millions? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=300.64s)]
*  Have you found any examples of any services? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=305.16s)]
*  According to James Comer, 10 Biden family members were paid money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=308.0s)]
*  Maybe—do we know what the grandchildren did for their cut? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=312.04s)]
*  No, there is no real deliverable here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=316.24s)]
*  And in fact, you continue to see these foreigners providing the money, you know, being very [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=321.52s)]
*  vague and opaque about that this was about getting money into the hands of people that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  of folks far away from this country at the expense of our country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=331.84s)]
*  Remember, people don't pay bribes to not get something in return. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=335.88s)]
*  In this case, what the Chinese got in return is that all of the Trump policies that targeted [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Chinese influence and malign activity, those were abolished. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=344.4s)]
*  The China initiative was abolished day one in the Joe Biden presidency. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=347.88s)]
*  So Hunter took the money, and then Joe delivered on the promises so that the Chinese were paid [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=352.12s)]
*  off and the Americans were left in the lurch. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=357.08s)]
*  Is it true, have you confirmed, that in December of 2015, against what John Solomon said was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  official Obama administration policy, that Hunter was, I believe, in Dubai with Burisma [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=366.56s)]
*  executives and got on the phone with Joe—that's five days before he went to Ukraine and, in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  his own words, leveraged a billion dollars. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=379.88s)]
*  He got six hours. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=382.16s)]
*  Son of a B, they did it, and got the prosecutor investigating Burisma and his son fired. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=383.16s)]
*  Do we know for a fact that he did that against official policy of the Obama administration? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=388.76s)]
*  We believe that those bribes actually changed policies in the Obama administration, because [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=396.28s)]
*  as you correctly note, previously there was the perspective that we wanted to see these [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=401.56s)]
*  prosecutions occur. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=406.12s)]
*  We wanted to see the prosecutor successful. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=407.4s)]
*  That prosecutor was fired commensurate with Hunter getting paid a million bucks a year [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  for absolutely nothing, while he claimed he was stoned out of his mind. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  And no experience. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=418.36s)]
*  I must add that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=419.72s)]
*  Zero experience. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=420.72s)]
*  Hunter, hence the name. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=421.72s)]
*  Alright, Matt Gaetz, thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=423.08s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cubhc185XQA&t=424.84s)]
