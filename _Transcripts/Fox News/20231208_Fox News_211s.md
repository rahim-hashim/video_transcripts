# Trump on Hunter Biden's scandals: 'Could you imagine if I did it?'
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI)
*  All right, now, during our town hall in Iowa on Tuesday, I spoke with President Trump about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=0.0s)]
*  the scandals all around Hunter Biden and Joe Biden before last night's indictment. Here's what he had to say. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=5.68s)]
*  To have the Biden family, and they're making millions from barrisma. Now, think of this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=13.68s)]
*  From China, too? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=19.04s)]
*  From China, in both cases with energy conglomerates in both countries. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=20.16s)]
*  And here you have Hunter Biden on tape admitting on Good Morning America he has no experience in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  energy, oil, gas, coal or Ukraine. And then Joe leveraged a billion dollars of our money, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=31.68s)]
*  in spite of it being Obama policy, to give them a billion in loan guarantees. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  And then he gets the prosecutor fired. Hunter was admitted as an addict at the time, no experience, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=45.44s)]
*  continues to get paid. The CEFC, that's the WhatsApp message. I'm sitting here next to my [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=52.4s)]
*  father and, you know, you haven't fulfilled your bargain. Five days later, according to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=57.44s)]
*  James Comer, $5 million ends up in one of what Comer calls their shell accounts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=61.44s)]
*  And do you think that Joe Biden is compromised by these countries based on the amount of money [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=66.56s)]
*  in business he did with China and with Russia and with Kazakhstan and Romania and Ukraine? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=73.68s)]
*  Do you believe that that— [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=79.52s)]
*  So, first of all, Jamie Comer and Jim Jordan are doing a great job. We'll do that real quickly, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=80.24s)]
*  because — but they are doing a great job. They are really putting it on the line. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=84.08s)]
*  But not only compromised. So, if you look at the kind of money they're getting where Hunter, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=89.44s)]
*  from sitting on a board — a board — he's sitting on a board, he's getting $168,000 a month, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  they say, and he got $3 million payment, and he knows nothing about energy. It's an energy company. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=102.16s)]
*  But you take a look at the kind of thing that's going on, the kind of money. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=107.04s)]
*  You know, one of the most egregious was — because I always put myself in a — can you imagine if I [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  did it? He never painted a painting in his life — a picture, a painting. Never painted in his life. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  And they're selling paintings for $500,000 a piece. And I got wise to it because the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  White House people called me. They want to do a painting of me. And they gave me the 10 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  great artists. You know, these are really high — [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=132.88s)]
*  Was Hunter on the list? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=134.56s)]
*  No, Hunter wasn't on the list. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=135.76s)]
*  Oh, just checking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  That was the goodness. He could have been on the list. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=137.6s)]
*  But they want — and these are real artists. They make you look better than you look. Even [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  better. The only good artists, they have to make us look better. If it's a painting, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=145.04s)]
*  we have to look better. Right? But these are great artists. The money they get is a fraction [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  of what this guy did for modern art, where they throw some stuff and they say, next, next. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  And he's getting a half a million dollars. And I hear — maybe it's wrong — but I hear that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=158.32s)]
*  China bought a lot of those paintings. Okay? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=164.88s)]
*  But when I heard the 500, I said, you know, that's one that's never going to go. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  And now people take it like it's okay. Could you imagine me doing that or my sons doing that? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=171.36s)]
*  No. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=177.12s)]
*  Or the great Ivanka Trump doing that? Do we like Ivanka? I think we like Ivanka a lot. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  No, but could you imagine Eric or Don or — [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  I say this all the time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=187.28s)]
*  — the concept is incredible. He's getting a half a million dollars a painting, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=188.08s)]
*  and nobody can even check it. You know, they haven't really checked it, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  but I hear the numbers are staggering. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PE5xSCSQI&t=195.84s)]
