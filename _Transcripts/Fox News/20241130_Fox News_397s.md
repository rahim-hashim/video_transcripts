# Newt Gingrich: Democrats spent over a billion trying to beat Trump and he is still standing
**Fox News:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM)
*  former Speaker of the House and my mentor, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=0.0s)]
*  Newt, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=4.76s)]
*  This is such an amazing series of events. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's not a surprise to folks like us, but look at how forgiving and accommodating and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=9.26s)]
*  collaborative President Trump is with people in the case of some of these world leaders, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=13.4s)]
*  but also Mark Zuckerberg himself, who threw Trump off of Facebook, now known as Metta [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=19.54s)]
*  after January 6, who got blamed for Trump's election in 2016 and then turned around and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=24.64s)]
*  spent all those Zucker bucks in the 2020 election. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=31.12s)]
*  Here he is dining with President Trump and trying to figure out a way to hear Stephen [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=33.44s)]
*  Miller say, be part of America's renewal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Walk us through it, Newt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=41.88s)]
*  You've seen it all, but this just feels historic every day. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=42.88s)]
*  Well, Kellyanne, first of all, I think the only way you can begin to understand this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=46.36s)]
*  is to take Trump totally outside of normal American politics and recognize that he's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=54.44s)]
*  a mythic figure. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=61.72s)]
*  He's like some of the people who come out of the Viking sagas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=62.72s)]
*  I mean, here's a guy who, as you know, because you were right there, you managed his successful [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=66.72s)]
*  campaign in 16. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=71.92s)]
*  This guy has been pounded on, pounded on, had shot, I mean, taken in to get his picture [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=73.92s)]
*  made at the sheriff's office, everything they could do for nine years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=80.1s)]
*  And he's still standing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=85.1s)]
*  I think all of a sudden, when he won, and of course, if I can just say for a second, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  Kamala's video was so embarrassing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=92.82s)]
*  I don't know whether she was drunk, hungover, utterly confused or what, but that's sort [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=96.78s)]
*  of reinforced for everybody. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  They spent a billion five trying to beat Trump, and he's still standing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=104.34s)]
*  One step further, a friend of mine tonight showed me his family had gotten together for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=110.7s)]
*  Thanksgiving. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  They played YMCA and danced to it in terms of Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  And instead of saying young man, they were singing Trump man. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=121.42s)]
*  Now, this is the kind of cultural change that you see maybe twice in a century. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  And that's what's happening right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=132.1s)]
*  You have a genuine historic leader, champion of a cause, and all around the planet, people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=133.84s)]
*  suddenly went, oops, I guess he's real. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=140.28s)]
*  I guess he's going to be powerful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=143.12s)]
*  And I guess I better find a way to deal with him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=144.68s)]
*  And that's what's happening at every level. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=147.52s)]
*  I agree with you, Newt. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=151.24s)]
*  I mean, you have Justin Trudeau down at Mar-a-Lago, Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=152.24s)]
*  You have people in the cabin who ran against Donald Trump for president, who called him [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=155.44s)]
*  names, et cetera. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=159.68s)]
*  But that goes away when you actually want to work together and get things done. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=160.68s)]
*  Now, you know a thing or two about political revolutions and then those first 100 days. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=163.8s)]
*  You did that in 94 and 95 as the speaker of the House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you think are the three or four most important things for President Trump to attempt [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  to do and to get done in those first 100 days of his second term? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=177.44s)]
*  Well, you already started tonight with the whole issue of immigration and deportation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  and breaking the idea of sanctuary cities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=188.2s)]
*  That's number one, because you can go right at it on day one. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=190.72s)]
*  The executive orders, he issues, will be fundamental in changing things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=195.6s)]
*  The big thing, the number one thing beyond everything else, can they put together a tax [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=200.44s)]
*  and regulatory package so powerful that it launches the economy for 26? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=206.06s)]
*  Because as you know, the key election for Trump is 26. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=213.08s)]
*  If he can be like Franklin Roosevelt and actually pick up seats in the House instead [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=217.26s)]
*  of losing the House, now he has truly begun to establish a new system and a new coalition [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=221.78s)]
*  and a new majority. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=228.14s)]
*  And the only way you do that is to have such dramatic economic growth in the next year [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=229.14s)]
*  and a half that people go to the ballot box saying, I want to reinforce this, this is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  a better future. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  So I would say designing a tax and regulatory package of enormous power, going to the country [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=240.86s)]
*  like Reagan did, convincing the country so the country then convinces Congress, is the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  number one job after they close the border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  Now, it's incredible, and it all seems doable. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  And as you say, there are people wanting to work with him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=260.94s)]
*  What do you make of the Democratic Party, the infighting, the lack of financing, I think, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=264.3s)]
*  energy for the so-called resistance now? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=268.94s)]
*  What becomes of them the next two years? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=271.7s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, imagine you were one of the folks who contributed to the $1,500,000,000 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=273.78s)]
*  and now learned that her own staff never once had her ahead in a poll. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=284.34s)]
*  Now, they were lying to their donors for the entire campaign. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=291.14s)]
*  So you're sitting here saying, do I want to invest more in this? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  And I think there will be really a three-way fight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=298.86s)]
*  There will be the hard left, which will be for a radically different vision of America. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=301.1s)]
*  And as they watch Trump take that apart, they'll go crazier and crazier. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=306.66s)]
*  There will be sort of a liberal resistance. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=311.22s)]
*  And then there will be a bunch of Democrats, my guess is six or eight in the Senate, 30, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  40 or 50 in the House, who are going to go up and say, you know, the American people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  have spoken. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=323.5s)]
*  I have an obligation to work with them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=324.62s)]
*  Remember, as you know, when we passed welfare reform when I was speaker, we split the Democrats [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  evenly, 101 to 101. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=332.86s)]
*  When Reagan passed his big tax cut, we got one-third of the Democrats to vote for it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=336.22s)]
*  So the key is, do the right thing, convince the American people it's the right thing, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=341.3s)]
*  mobilize them, and they will drive about, I think, 20 to 30 percent of the Democratic [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=347.54s)]
*  Party will end up voting with Trump, making Speaker Johnson's job easier. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=352.82s)]
*  And at the same time, it will lead to a huge civil war in their party. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=357.06s)]
*  And my guess is they won't recover for 12 to 16 years if we do our job right, we deliver [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=361.82s)]
*  economic growth, we deliver prosperity, we deliver a controlled border. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=368.86s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House who led the Republican Revolution in 1994 [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=374.1s)]
*  with the Contract with America, gives us the blueprint for the first 100 days of the next [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=378.7s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=383.06s)]
*  Newt, thank you so much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b2hhjvpTvM&t=384.06s)]
