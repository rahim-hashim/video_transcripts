# Sen. Lindsey Graham: The 'whole world is watching' Biden
**Fox News:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ)
*  All right, following Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance, Senator Lindsey Graham, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  he is sounding the alarm on national security concerns now that Biden's inability to serve [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  as commander in chief was televised to the entire world, and Senator Graham's concerns, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=10.8s)]
*  they are valid. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=15.8s)]
*  Tonight, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that during the Group of Seven summit, this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=16.8s)]
*  is back in 2022, Biden didn't even show up to an early evening meeting with the German [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  chancellor because, according to Anthony Blinken, he had to go beddy-bye. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, remember, this was just a few months after the start of the Russian invasion of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=31.32s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Here with reaction is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is with us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Senator, every single Democrat you work with, every one of them, they all lied to the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=42.44s)]
*  They all knew. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=49.7s)]
*  They all covered it up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=51.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris knew. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=52.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is saying he's going to go to bed at 8 a.m. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=54.94s)]
*  Well, what if there's a crisis at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. that requires him to stay awake [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=57.7s)]
*  24, 36, 48 straight hours? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=64.5s)]
*  He can't do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=67.62s)]
*  Our security is in jeopardy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=70.42s)]
*  I think so. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=72.78s)]
*  One, thanks for having me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=73.78s)]
*  It's good to have a Republican nominee for president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=75.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, who's ready to go on day one, can straighten out the world pretty quickly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=78.22s)]
*  But here's what I worry about. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=82.68s)]
*  The whole world is watching. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=83.98s)]
*  They saw the interview. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=85.58s)]
*  They saw the debate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=86.58s)]
*  And how does World War III start? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=87.58s)]
*  One way to start World War III is for the Iranians to break out and acquire a nuclear [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=90.48s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=95.74s)]
*  I promise you, every Arab in the Mideast will want a nuclear weapon of their own. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=96.74s)]
*  And the next thing you know, we're on the road to Armageddon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=100.9s)]
*  Trump had Iran in a box. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=104.46s)]
*  The Ayatollah and the Iranians are running wild under Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=106.4s)]
*  So here's what I would tell President Biden. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=110.22s)]
*  Eighty percent of the people today in a Washington Post poll think you're too old to be president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  I'm worried about you being commander in chief for four more months, much less four more [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=123.66s)]
*  Why don't you take a cognitive exam to assure all of us that you are as fit as you say you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=124.66s)]
*  are, because all of us doubt it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=131.42s)]
*  Why won't he take a cognitive test, Sean? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=133.66s)]
*  Because he would fail it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=137.26s)]
*  He knows he would fail. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=138.98s)]
*  Everybody who wants Biden to stay in place knows he will fail. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=141.18s)]
*  And it scares the hell out of me that we're going to be having this man to be commander [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  in chief for four more months. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=149.94s)]
*  Here's a problem we have, because the same policies that Biden has supported would be [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=152.74s)]
*  supported by Kamala Harris. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=160.5s)]
*  The same weakness on the world stage, the same New Green Deal policies, the same open [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=161.5s)]
*  border policies, the same economic policies, the same energy policies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=166.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=171.02s)]
*  What, you just fill in the name, replace Biden, and you've got the same horrible policies [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=172.02s)]
*  that have failed miserably. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=179.18s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump can stay up for 48 hours because he doesn't sleep anyway. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=186.3s)]
*  You know, number one, I've never seen a guy with this much energy at any age. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=187.3s)]
*  He's playing the best golf of his life. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=191.5s)]
*  I'm, you know, I played with him last week on Play With Him Sunday. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=193.06s)]
*  So let me talk about changing the name and the policies the same. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=199.78s)]
*  She's been involved in every policy decision. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=200.78s)]
*  That was a disaster, including Afghanistan. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=202.94s)]
*  She's been the border czar. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=205.5s)]
*  And what have we got for it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  10 million illegal immigrants. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  She's for the Green New Deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=209.82s)]
*  She's cosponsored AOC's bill. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=211.1s)]
*  She's for Medicare for All. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  She cosponsored Bernie's bill, Medicare for All. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=214.82s)]
*  So in many ways, she's more liberal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=217.7s)]
*  What I worry about is the president's ability to project capability at a time of really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=220.06s)]
*  great threat. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  You know who I talked to this morning? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  Lindsay, I'm making the point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  None of them, none of them have policies that, that in any way show strength to the world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  We have about 20 seconds. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, policy, I agree with you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  The policies will be weak, but this man's got, the first guy I talked to this morning [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  was Bebe. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=246.38s)]
*  Trust me, he's very worried about the Iranians breaking out and getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=247.62s)]
*  I can't wait for Trump comes back to end the madness. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=251.5s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=256.1s)]
*  What's scary is you work with a bunch of liars and they've known the whole time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=257.1s)]
*  Historic proportions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=262.26s)]
*  More Hannity next. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sSbAU_MCGQ&t=264.46s)]
