# Sean Hannity: The state-run media mob is working overtime
**Fox News:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and we are 43 days away from an inflection point for this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the 2024 election. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=6.08s)]
*  Early voting now underway in multiple states, including Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=8.16s)]
*  And tonight I start with good news, and there's a little bad news. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The good news first. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=16.86s)]
*  Donald Trump is performing very well in multiple new polls. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=18.2s)]
*  University of Mary Washington survey shows that Donald Trump is deadlocked in the Commonwealth [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=22.0s)]
*  of Virginia. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=27.28s)]
*  Texas state Biden won by 10 points. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=28.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siena poll has President Trump up by 5 in Arizona, 4 in Georgia, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  2 in North Carolina. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=36.2s)]
*  On top of last week, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they had Trump up 3 in Georgia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=38.08s)]
*  Georgia, North Carolina must win states for Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=43.68s)]
*  Now, these were polls of likely voters, which is typically more accurate than, quote, registered [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=47.32s)]
*  voters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  But you've got to keep this in mind. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  The New York Times poll traditionally skews left. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=56.12s)]
*  In 2020, this very same poll was off by 5 points in North Carolina, 5 points in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=59.0s)]
*  off by 6 in Arizona, and a whopping 11 points in Wisconsin. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=65.96s)]
*  Now, other polls also seem to skew to the left in 2020 and 2016, for that matter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=70.0s)]
*  At this very same time, four years ago, Donald Trump was down by 7 in the Real Clear Politics [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  average nationwide. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=82.48s)]
*  A month later, he was down by 10. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=84.08s)]
*  An Economist-YouGov poll had Trump down by 10. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=86.52s)]
*  And by the way, that's right before the election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=90.56s)]
*  Another poll right before the election from NBC News had Trump down by 10. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=92.8s)]
*  In the end, 44,000 votes in three states made all the difference in 2020, never mind, of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=98.06s)]
*  course, the FBI pre-bunking the very real Hunter Biden laptop story by meeting weekly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  with Big Tech in the months before that election. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=109.7s)]
*  They verified the authenticity of Hunter's very real laptop from hell in March of 2020. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  But then, when they were asked about it after the New York Post broke the story, we can't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=118.72s)]
*  confirm or deny when they knew damn well it was true. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  You cannot let any poll or betting market affect you emotionally or in any way whatsoever. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=128.22s)]
*  You can't listen to the political pundits. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=136.08s)]
*  You can't let them impact how you feel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=138.3s)]
*  And by the way, you have often, as is the case, biased news organizations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=142.04s)]
*  They will try to deflate voter enthusiasm, and they try to create a narrative that the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=146.84s)]
*  election is over. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=153.04s)]
*  There's absolutely no reason for you to vote. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=154.04s)]
*  There's not a chance in hell your guy's going to win. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=156.8s)]
*  Nobody can tell you right now, nobody, with any degree of accuracy, how this election [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=159.8s)]
*  is going to turn out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=165.84s)]
*  They can guess. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=166.84s)]
*  They can use their best methodology. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=167.84s)]
*  They might end up being right, but my advice is don't let anybody, especially in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=169.84s)]
*  corrupt state-run media mob, impact what you want for your country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=174.84s)]
*  At this point, the only person that really knows what the outcome is, that would be God. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, naturally, the state-run media mob, they're working overtime. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  They want to elect Kamala Harris. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=187.36s)]
*  They want Donald Trump defeated at all costs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  They have done nothing but go after this man for nearly a full decade. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=191.8s)]
*  Now, the coverage against President Trump, oh, it's like 95 percent on some networks, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  negative. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris up to 100 percent positive. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump is evil, and Kamala is the second coming that gets a complete pass and gets to stay [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  in the candidate protection program. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  The latest strategy includes the new allegations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=212.24s)]
*  Look at what's going on in North Carolina with their lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  He is accused of making offensive comments that no conservative or Republican would ever [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=218.88s)]
*  agree with. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=223.56s)]
*  Now, I don't know, we don't know if the allegations are true. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=224.72s)]
*  It's odd. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  He's been in office three years, and apparently nobody or very few people in North Carolina [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  knew much about any of this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=234.8s)]
*  And if it wasn't big news in North Carolina, then Donald Trump certainly didn't know either. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=237.08s)]
*  Now, this is the Harris campaign. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=241.6s)]
*  They are trying to smear, as usual, former President Trump for something that nobody [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=243.6s)]
*  or few people knew about, if in fact is even true. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=248.8s)]
*  The campaign even launched a guilt-by-association ad blasting Donald Trump's prior endorsement [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  of Robinson. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=258.44s)]
*  Others are even trying to connect now Trump to P. Diddy, who he said something nice about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=259.44s)]
*  years and years and years ago. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  But at the very same time, no one in the media mob seems to care about Kamala Harris and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  her effusive praise of P. Diddy, now credibly accused of horrible sex crimes and indicted. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=274.3s)]
*  Now, did either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris know a thing about P. Diddy? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=281.32s)]
*  I pretty much can say with certainty I doubt it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=286.84s)]
*  No one in the media cares about Kamala's past support. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=290.2s)]
*  Remember Jussie Smollett and the hate crime hoax? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=292.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris once promoted that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=296.4s)]
*  She rushed a judgment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  I think she called it a modern-day lynching, and I don't think she ever took that down [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  or took it back. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Almost no one has called on Harris to distance herself from her radical California pastor [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=305.84s)]
*  You know, the guy who blamed 9-11 on America only days after the attack during a sermon [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=311.28s)]
*  that even Nancy Pelosi condemned? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=317.4s)]
*  In fact, the same pastor was invited to give the DNC's convention prayer, and no one [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=320.08s)]
*  in the media mob batted an eyelash. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=325.84s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Another one of Kamala's favorite preachers said that Christianity has been hijacked by [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=330.08s)]
*  white supremacy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=334.56s)]
*  But the vice president, he's never been asked about that preacher, never asked to condemn [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=336.28s)]
*  that preacher, no Trump ads tying her to the preacher, and, you know, after she was [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=340.88s)]
*  hired by the campaign on top of it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=346.96s)]
*  Kamala's running mate, Tim Walz, he prays on a Muslim cleric, you might remember, from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=349.32s)]
*  Minnesota who celebrated the October 7th Islamic radical terrorist attacks on Israel, losing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=353.52s)]
*  the equivalent of 40,000 Americans in a day, and shared pro-Hitler propaganda online. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=360.24s)]
*  Anyone in the media ever talk about this? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  And yet, this story barely made the news. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=368.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Harris campaign proudly touting the endorsement of the union that represents [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=371.36s)]
*  the IRS. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=377.52s)]
*  Wow, what a great endorsement. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=378.52s)]
*  She can't get the endorsement of the Teamsters, especially rank and file, but America's tax [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=380.6s)]
*  collectors love Kamala Harris. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=386.52s)]
*  The media mob, they're dutifully overjoyed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=389.44s)]
*  What an endorsement. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=392.68s)]
*  Now, of course, the state-run media mob also refuses to hold Kamala accountable for her [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=393.92s)]
*  radical positions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=399.72s)]
*  We have been pointing this out now for months, and they still don't ask the fundamental [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=400.88s)]
*  basic questions, because they seem perfectly happy reading statements from anonymous campaign [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=406.16s)]
*  ads who just claim that Kamala no longer supports the very extreme positions she has stated [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=412.8s)]
*  in her own words. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=419.76s)]
*  I have the Kamala files on Hannity.com, my social media. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a public service so that you can share it on social media with friends, family, neighbors, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  co-workers. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  She's on tape saying the most insane, radical things I've ever heard from any presidential [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  candidate, and repeatedly making her positions very clear that she's now running away from, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=437.88s)]
*  and the media is allowing her to hide. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=445.36s)]
*  Now, this includes Kamala's steadfast support for a total fracking ban. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  No shocker. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Over the weekend, another video surfaced showing Kamala's stance, strong stance, against fracking. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=461.28s)]
*  Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=462.28s)]
*  That's why I am committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs, and finally [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=469.0s)]
*  putting an end to fracking once and for all. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=474.46s)]
*  Now, is anyone going to ask Kamala why she has—you know, no suddenly and mysteriously [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=478.56s)]
*  changed her position now? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  Why—how is that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=486.62s)]
*  Is anybody in the media mob—will they ask Kamala about the Borders czar's stance against [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  deporting illegal immigrants? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=493.52s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Let's go, everybody. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=507.64s)]
*  No deportation. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=510.28s)]
*  Break our laws. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=511.52s)]
*  No problem. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=512.52s)]
*  Is she still against deporting illegal immigrants? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=513.52s)]
*  Because as the borders are, that definitely seemed to be the case. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=515.84s)]
*  In fact, remember, she also has publicly, in her own words, supported decriminalizing [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  illegal immigration. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=526.76s)]
*  Taxpayer-funded healthcare, housing, food, education, and even sex change surgery for [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=528.28s)]
*  illegal immigrants with your tax dollars. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=536.68s)]
*  She allowed people with known terror ties into your country. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=539.84s)]
*  Dozens of Americans have been murdered and raped and victims of violent crime, all perpetrated [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=544.48s)]
*  by Harris and Biden unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=550.72s)]
*  Is anybody ever going to ask her about these radical extreme, frankly almost unbelievable [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=553.8s)]
*  positions? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=560.76s)]
*  Because our very own Sarah Carter, she talked to voters. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=561.76s)]
*  They're not happy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=564.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=565.88s)]
*  Is it frustrating to see all the people that have come in because they haven't been properly [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=566.88s)]
*  vetted? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=570.72s)]
*  It's just been illegal influx. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=571.72s)]
*  So you have a lot of criminal networks from Venezuela, from other parts of the world. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=572.72s)]
*  I mean, mixed in with the good people, but there's so many criminals flooding in, they're [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=577.4s)]
*  not going to be able to find them all to get them out. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=583.48s)]
*  Once they're in, it's a lot harder to just get them out. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=584.48s)]
*  So it's just a never-ending cycle with this administration. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=586.68s)]
*  I think at this point right now, with the amount of people that have come across on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=591.24s)]
*  the terrorist list, we're just waiting for the next 9-11 basically to occur. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=594.04s)]
*  So I take it that you would not be all about open borders policy. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=597.68s)]
*  Oh my God, who would? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=601.92s)]
*  How about the border issue, the border crisis? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=603.92s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  That should have never happened. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about the fact that Kamala Harris in the past has supported the policy [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=611.12s)]
*  to use taxpayer dollars to pay for transgender surgery for illegal detained migrants? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=616.32s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  She's spending money on people that don't even belong here and we're not even taking [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=625.1600000000001s)]
*  care of the people that are here, even our own vets, people that are veterans. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=627.08s)]
*  I mean, everyday civilians that live here in our own country, we're not even dealing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=631.2s)]
*  with our own people. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=634.44s)]
*  To use taxpayer dollars to do that is kind of a betrayal of us as the American people, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=635.44s)]
*  especially us as cattle ranchers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=641.48s)]
*  I mean, we pay for a lot of stuff. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=643.88s)]
*  We work our fingers through the bone day in, day out. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  So to hear that is kind of like a backstab. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=650.0s)]
*  Four more years of Kamala would be a disaster. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=652.16s)]
*  And the Green New Deal eliminate the filibuster of, oh, you get government health care for [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=657.52s)]
*  all and no private insurance option. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  Trump and JD Vance, they're talking to Americans every day about these issues. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=665.28s)]
*  They do press conferences. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  They do town halls. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=672.04s)]
*  They do interview after interview after interview. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, on the other hand, barely get out from behind a teleprompter [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  and a short speech that always seems to be the same. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=680.76s)]
*  The state-run media mob, they don't mind. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=684.12s)]
*  In fact, they're happy to do the heavy lifting, while Kamala hides in plain sight. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=686.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=691.48s)]
*  I don't think it's a lot to ask her to sit down for a real interview as opposed to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=692.48s)]
*  a pop piece in which she describes her feelings of growing up in Oakland with nice laws. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=696.92s)]
*  I would just say to that, when you move to Nirvana, give me your real estate broker's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  number and I'll be your next door neighbor. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=707.96s)]
*  We don't live there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=710.36s)]
*  I know that we would love or you would love to see her sit down every single day with [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=711.72s)]
*  CNN and do interviews, but she's a very busy person. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=716.44s)]
*  She's the vice president as well as a candidate. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  These events are part of a strategy that the Harris campaign is putting out there, which [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=723.08s)]
*  is to largely avoid doing interviews. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=728.2s)]
*  They're not necessarily settings where she shines, so they're doing this instead. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=731.6s)]
*  There's only 40 plus days left. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=736.52s)]
*  Don't they need to be out there more? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=738.2s)]
*  Oh my goodness, I mean, they're out there all the time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=740.08s)]
*  They're out there talking to voters all the time. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=743.6s)]
*  And I think that the vice president has also said that she's going to be talking to more [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=745.4s)]
*  reporters, both national as well as local reporters, and I think that's a good thing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=749.24s)]
*  They're talking at the voters. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=754.32s)]
*  They're not listening to and answering their questions, but the media is helping and it [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=756.76s)]
*  doesn't stop there because both Walls and Kamala have also been given a free pass for [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=760.92s)]
*  their disgraceful conduct during the summer of 2020, you know, mostly peaceful rioting, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=765.8s)]
*  574 of them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=771.16s)]
*  That's when Walls let Minneapolis, you know, half burn to the ground. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=773.12s)]
*  Kamala promoting a bail fund four days after a police precinct was burned to the ground [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=776.76s)]
*  to get the rioters back out on the street and then said the rioters won't stop rioting. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=783.12s)]
*  They shouldn't stop and she wouldn't stop supporting them. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=788.56s)]
*  But I do agree with Walls on one issue, one issue. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=791.6s)]
*  We can't afford four more years of this. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=795.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  She simply has said it doesn't have to be this way. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have to be this way. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=803.84s)]
*  We can't afford, we can't afford four more years of this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=805.9s)]
*  We can't afford four more years of this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=813.8s)]
*  Well done, Timmy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=816.28s)]
*  Good job. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=817.48s)]
*  No one in the state-run media mob seems to care. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=818.48s)]
*  After all, they have an election to win at all costs. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTkKH1TjP4&t=820.9200000000001s)]
