# Sean Hannity: This is the only detail Hunter Biden can remember
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI)
*  And welcome to Hannity. Now, the transcript of Hunter Biden's deposition has been released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=0.0s)]
*  late last night, and we have been extensively combing through it. Now, according to the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=4.8s)]
*  transcript, Hunter addressed the infamous, I'm sitting here with my father, that WhatsApp [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=9.68s)]
*  message telling lawmakers he can't even remember sending it because he was either so drunk [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  or high saying, quote, I was out of my mind. But the only thing that Hunter can say for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=21.28s)]
*  sure that he can remember is that his father was not there. Wow. How selective can one [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=26.96s)]
*  be out of my mind? I don't remember even sending the text. I'm not even sure if it's my text, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=33.64s)]
*  but I know for sure my dad wasn't there. Okay. Now, just days after threatening that threatening [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  message was sent, according to a 2020 Senate report, well, it accounts linked to Hunter [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=46.1s)]
*  Biden. Guess what? They received over five million dollars from the CEFC. That's who [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=52.0s)]
*  he sent the WhatsApp message to. For being out of his mind, you got to admit, I'd say [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=58.16s)]
*  that's a pretty amazing achievement. Hunter also confirmed to lawmakers that he did, in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=62.84s)]
*  fact, receive money from Chinese companies. Now, this is in stark contrast from his comments [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=68.2s)]
*  during that disastrous GMA interview when he said he didn't receive one cent from China. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=74.2s)]
*  Take a look. The president has repeatedly said that you received $1.5 billion from China [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=80.96s)]
*  despite no experience and for no apparent reason. Obviously, fact checkers have said [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  that that is not true. Look, this is literally has no basis in fact in any way. Have you [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=92.0s)]
*  received any money from non-business dealing? No. At all? Not one cent? Not one cent. Really? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=97.66s)]
*  According to the transcript, Hunter also told lawmakers that his business with CEFC, that's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  the Chinese oil conglomerate, was called completely legitimate, completely 100 percent in line [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  with my experience and my abilities. But let's go back to that GMA interview. Hunter admitted [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  he had no experience at all in energy when asked about his role with Perisma. Take a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=120.72s)]
*  look. You didn't have any extensive knowledge about natural gas or Ukraine itself, though? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=126.6s)]
*  No. But I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board, if [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=132.6s)]
*  not more. In the list that you gave me of the reasons why you're on that board, you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=137.2s)]
*  did not list the fact that you were the son of the vice president. Of course. What role [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=141.28s)]
*  do you think that played? I think that it is impossible for me to be on any of the boards [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=145.28s)]
*  that I just mentioned without saying that I'm the son of the vice president of the United [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=149.92s)]
*  States. Oh, wait a minute. Probably not. With no experience in energy, oil, gas, Ukraine, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=153.04s)]
*  no experience in China, addicted to hard drugs and at times, quote, out of his mind. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=161.28s)]
*  How was his business, as he said, quote, completely 100 percent in line with his experience? Because [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=168.6s)]
*  that's what he said. Meanwhile, also during the deposition, Hunter was asked about Devin [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=175.04s)]
*  Archer's claim that Joe was on speakerphone with his business associates. Hunter did tell [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=179.72s)]
*  lawmakers, quote, Well, certainly my dad called me. Hunter also admitted that he introduced [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=185.76s)]
*  his father to one of his business partners, Jonathan Lee, while in China. And he told [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=191.4s)]
*  lawmakers there were, in fact, two dinners at Cafe Milano. That's in D.C., where Joe [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=196.16s)]
*  met his business partners in one case from Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine, confirming [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=202.0s)]
*  that Russian oligarch, Elena Baterina, who reportedly transferred three point five million [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=208.8s)]
*  dollars to a Hunter link company and invested, according to Devin Archer, another one hundred [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  and twenty million in one of their real estate adventures, was in attendance. Wow. How convenient. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  Now, Hunter repeatedly said that his father never received any benefits, nor was he ever [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  involved with his business. He said he never once even discussed it. Joe said, OK, never [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  talked to Hunter, my brother or anybody for that matter. OK, was Joe out of his mind too? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=241.06s)]
*  So really, then why did Hunter once complain about giving half his salary to pops, having [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=247.3s)]
*  to give half his salary to pops? Why did Devin Archer's testimony corroborated by Tony Bobolinski, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=253.3s)]
*  who, Hunter, they're all liars except for him? Why did they say that the brand being [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=260.14s)]
*  sold was that of Joe Biden? Certainly wouldn't be the guy addicted to crack. Now, also breaking [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  today, the transcript of James Biden's testimony was released this afternoon and it spells [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  more trouble for Joe Biden. According to his testimony, James Biden admitted that Joe received [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=277.02s)]
*  forty thousand dollars in China funds corroborating James Comer's investigation, revealing that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=282.78s)]
*  Sarah and James Biden sent Joe a forty thousand dollar check for a quote loan repayment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  Do they have the paperwork? Anyway, after receiving money from Hunter, who had received [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  millions from the Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC just days prior. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKcf9RADqI&t=300.5s)]
