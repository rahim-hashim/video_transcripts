# Sean Hannity: These are ‘unprecedented times’
**Fox News:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and we have one jam-packed hour tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=0.0s)]
*  Mexico actually lecturing America and your president Joe on border issues and demanding [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=8.92s)]
*  tens of billions of your dollars. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The inmates, by the way, running the asylum over at MSDNC. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=17.88s)]
*  We've got great tape. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=20.84s)]
*  People like liberal Joe and Chuck E. Todd. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=22.84s)]
*  Anyway, oh, and Diddy's Home, rated for possible sex trafficking. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=25.72s)]
*  We're watching that story tonight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=29.92s)]
*  Also tonight, we're going to show you what may be the biggest beatdown of a climate alarmist [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  in U.S. history. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=37.68s)]
*  And then he will join us, Senator Kennedy of Louisiana, in his epic beatdown. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=39.0s)]
*  Here's a small sample. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=43.32s)]
*  If we spent those trillions of dollars and became carbon neutral by 2050 in the United [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=45.52s)]
*  States, which you advocate, how much will it reduce world temperatures? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=50.52s)]
*  I don't have an answer for that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=58.72s)]
*  You don't know? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=60.16s)]
*  No. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=60.88s)]
*  You think we're all to spend the money and then see what happens? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=61.4s)]
*  Great scare. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=65.92s)]
*  I don't know much about science. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=67.12s)]
*  Anyway, the whole tape, you're not going to want to miss it coming up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=68.48s)]
*  But tonight, I've got to begin with a plea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=71.32s)]
*  Plea, please be kind to your radical far left friends. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=74.24s)]
*  It is only Monday, but they are having a very tough week. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=78.72s)]
*  Now, famed Democratic strategist James Carville. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=82.28s)]
*  I've debated him a number of times. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=85.28s)]
*  He just compared Biden's poll numbers to seeing your grandmother naked. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=86.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, an awkward and embarrassing and bizarre moment for your vice [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  president Harris. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Here she is accidentally clapping along to a protest against the Biden White House. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  Can't make that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what you're singing, but thank you for any for that anyway. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=105.2s)]
*  Anyway, back in New York, a bad day all the way around for fake news, CNN and the lunatic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  fringe at MSDNC. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Panic disbelief. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=114.92000000000002s)]
*  At the far left networks and of course, all the mainstream media mob. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=116.44s)]
*  Why Donald Trump scored a major legal victory out of New York. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=120.76s)]
*  Now, the state appeals court slashed his record setting bond from the attorney general's bogus [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=124.52s)]
*  civil fraud case from an unprecedented half a billion dollars to, well, one hundred seventy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=130.84s)]
*  five million. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=137.04s)]
*  Still a very high number, but Trump is prepared to pay it with cash. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=138.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=142.52s)]
*  We appreciate and respect the appellate division very much and we will, I think, do very well [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=143.68s)]
*  in that hope that we have a judge who I believe is a crooked judge and a crooked attorney general. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely crooked. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=157.36s)]
*  We did nothing wrong at all. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=159.36s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  And that was proven. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  And everybody there said it was proven. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=163.44s)]
*  All you have to do is read the legal scholars and you see there was proven. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  But we will continue with that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=169.52s)]
*  But we appreciate very much the decision of the appellate division. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=171.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=175.36s)]
*  What's your honor? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=176.36s)]
*  What's your honor? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=177.36s)]
*  Cash. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=179.36s)]
*  By the way, this was a case about valuations, the worst valuation or the biggest abuse of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=182.36s)]
*  evaluation that came from the judge in this case and Goran, who till this day sticks to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=187.04s)]
*  and maintains that Mar-a-Lago is only worth eighteen million dollars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=192.72s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=198.04s)]
*  As we have pointed out many times on this program, the attorney general's dream of seizing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=200.12s)]
*  Trump Tower and other Trump properties to cover his bond before an appeal, that is now [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=204.16s)]
*  dead and the far-left zealots over at MSDNC, they are not taking it well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=208.52s)]
*  They might need, I don't know, some comfort food and comfort animals tomorrow. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=214.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=219.8s)]
*  I mean, honestly, this is so infuriating, I don't even know what to do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=220.8s)]
*  I don't even know if I care what the process is that these judges are arriving at. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=224.88s)]
*  Whatever it is, it's flawed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you that much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, David put it well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  This is a different process for this person. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=234.24s)]
*  We have decided that he gets his own private court of justice. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  He has a private plane. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=241.4s)]
*  He has private clubs that he lives in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=243.12s)]
*  This is an absolute travesty. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=245.8s)]
*  It would not happen for anybody else. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=247.56s)]
*  Anybody else who would be like, sorry, buddy, you lost, pay up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=249.96s)]
*  For him, he gets his own set of rules. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=253.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is facing dozens of criminal and civil charges, including some that have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=256.36s)]
*  never been tried in a court of law. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=261.44s)]
*  Many of these charges levied by his political opponents, DOJ, that is the weaponization [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  of Joe Biden's DOJ. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  And during the height of a presidential campaign, wow, these unprecedented times. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=272.0s)]
*  Now, the state of New York was attempting to seize his business before he could even [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=276.44s)]
*  file an appeal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=280.36s)]
*  According to MSDNC, he's receiving preferential treatment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=282.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's preferential from their point of view. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, over the weekend on Fake News CNN, radical leftist congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  said that America would be put at risk if the state of New York did not seize Donald [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=298.88s)]
*  Trump's assets. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=303.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=304.8s)]
*  I think that what we are dealing with politically is the much larger and much more grave and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=305.8s)]
*  serious pressure of having this judgment against Donald Trump and him being in this degree [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=311.8s)]
*  of debt and the financial pressures that he is under and what he is subject to do in order [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=319.8s)]
*  to obtain those assets. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=326.38s)]
*  I actually think that whether—I actually think that there is risk in not seizing these [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=328.96s)]
*  assets and the open window that exists in him trying to secure these funds through other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=333.88s)]
*  means. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=341.48s)]
*  Now, so far, the radical left's plan to derail Trump through lawfare, as we call it, is not [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=342.48s)]
*  going as expected. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=349.08s)]
*  In the state of Georgia, anti-Trump DA Fonny Willis was strongly rebuked by a Superior [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=350.8s)]
*  Court judge as a potential liar who exhibited unprofessional behavior in and out of court. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=356.08s)]
*  Now, Fonny Willis says she has done nothing wrong and is now vowing to fight on against [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=362.84s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=368.08s)]
*  Quote, the train is coming. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=369.08s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=371.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=372.68s)]
*  I don't feel like my reputation needs to be reclaimed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=373.68s)]
*  Let's say it for the record. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=376.0s)]
*  I'm not embarrassed by anything I've done. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=377.24s)]
*  You know, I guess my greatest crime is I had a relationship with a man, but that's not [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=380.44s)]
*  something that I find embarrassing in any way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=385.8s)]
*  And I know that I have not done anything that's illegal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=388.68s)]
*  While that was going on, we were writing responsive briefs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=392.0s)]
*  We were still doing the case in the way that it needed to be done. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=394.56s)]
*  I don't feel like we've been slowed down at all. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=398.12s)]
*  I do think that there are efforts to slow down this train, but the train is coming. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=400.08s)]
*  Vengeance is mine, say Fonny Willis. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, amid all the chaos, the first criminal trial against Donald Trump, it now has a start [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  date that would be April the 15th. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=413.32s)]
*  This is a highly unusual case out of New York. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  You might remember, recall that Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg used what was a bizarre, unprecedented [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi8qdqKOlx0&t=418.36s)]
