# Sean Hannity: Kamala Harris has abandoned her radical, dangerous left-wing views
**Fox News:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we begin with a warning for all Americans on the left and right and in the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=2.52s)]
*  middle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=6.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris cannot be trusted. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=7.92s)]
*  Her only core value is her own personal political gain and ambition. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=10.34s)]
*  Now, for decades, Kamala has done and said pretty much anything to advance her political [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=16.76s)]
*  career. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=21.88s)]
*  Now, that includes padding her stats as a prosecutor. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=22.88s)]
*  She sought, you know, she sought these cheap convictions, didn't seem to care about guilt [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=27.48s)]
*  or innocence. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  So the law, rapper Jamal Truelove, remember, wrongfully convicted of murder, sentenced [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=32.88s)]
*  to 50 years in prison. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=38.88s)]
*  He said Kamala Harris, who was the San Francisco DA at the time, laughed in his face when the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  verdict was read. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  He ultimately won a large settlement over his conviction after it was overturned. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Meanwhile, an elderly man named George Gage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=52.0s)]
*  He was convicted of sexual assault, but a judge has found Kamala's office withheld [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  important exculpatory evidence that might well prove his innocence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  But a new trial was never granted due to a technicality, as Kamala fought to keep Gage [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=65.78s)]
*  behind bars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=70.46s)]
*  Why would you ever fight for somebody that has exculpatory evidence to be kept behind [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=71.46s)]
*  bars? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=75.88s)]
*  She didn't care whether or not he was guilty or innocent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=76.88s)]
*  She just wanted to keep her conviction record intact. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=79.16s)]
*  But once Kamala started to rise through the ranks of California politics, she quickly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=82.27999999999999s)]
*  lost her appetite for throwing people in jail altogether and adopted the soft on crime politics [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  you know today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=92.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  Because of their popularity with California's far-left base, now with the country radical [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  left and that far-left base. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=100.32s)]
*  She called on the criminal justice system to be fundamentally transformed, ending cash [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=103.08s)]
*  bail, legalizing drugs, expunging the records of thousands of felons, allowing convicts, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=108.28s)]
*  including those on death row, oh, even the Boston bombers, to vote from prison. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=115.64s)]
*  She repeatedly vilified law enforcement, calling on public safety. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=120.72s)]
*  Let's reimagine public safety. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=125.08s)]
*  Fewer police and demanding that resource officers be removed from schools. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=127.44s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=132.62s)]
*  She even compared policing to modern-day lynchings and Jim Crow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=134.06s)]
*  I don't make this up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=138.26s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=139.66s)]
*  When we say that America has a history of systemic racism, we mean that from slavery, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=140.66s)]
*  Jim Crow laws, lynchings and policing, our institutions have done violence to black Americans. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=149.66s)]
*  And it has caused black Americans to be treated as less than human. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=159.16s)]
*  Now, we all know full well how this worked out in San Francisco. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=166.16s)]
*  Crime is rampant, stores are closing, homelessness, open-air drug use, public defecation, urination, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  pretty much everywhere. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=177.76s)]
*  Kamala doesn't care because her soft on crime messaging helped her political career [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=178.76s)]
*  in the deep blue, radical state of California. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=184.56s)]
*  And in 2020, when Kamala desperately wanted to capitalize on the summer of love, what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  did she do? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  She encouraged deadly riots. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=196.26s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=197.76s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  You might even call it an insurrection if your name is Liz Cheney. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  She even promoted a bail fund to get these violent criminals out of jail four days after [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=204.56s)]
*  a police precinct was burned to the ground. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=210.2s)]
*  Innocent people raped and murdered by violent offenders out on bail thanks to this insane [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=212.76s)]
*  bail fund that she supported. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=218.66s)]
*  You know, they didn't have a lot of money. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=220.66s)]
*  They raised over $40 million after her tweet went out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=222.66s)]
*  Kamala doesn't seem to care. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=226.46s)]
*  She's only worried about advancing her own political ambition and career. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  That's why she accepted the job as Joe's running mate, only a few weeks after calling [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  him out as a racist. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=238.06s)]
*  Remember, Joe partnered with the former Klansman, and he didn't want the integration of schools. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  He thought public schools would become racial jungles. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=245.66s)]
*  And she said, well, I was that person. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  That's why she pretended that Biden was strong and vigorous when he was in a steep [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  cognitive decline until the very moment Democrats sent him packing in a coup and coordinated [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  her as the party's new nominee. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  If she really believed Biden was capable and really believed that he was the best man for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=264.06s)]
*  the job, well, why did she run to take a spot so quickly? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=268.86s)]
*  Again, she doesn't care about truth, just personal advancement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=273.06s)]
*  Again, she's going to say and do anything to win an election. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=277.06s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=279.86s)]
*  For years, she has enthusiastically promoted far-left policies only popular in deep blue [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  states. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  She co-sponsored the $93 trillion end of capitalism Green New Deal in the U.S. Senate [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=298.06s)]
*  She co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders, Medicare for All, Universal Health Care, the elimination [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  of private health insurance. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  You can't have the Party of Freedom says you can't have your own private health care. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=307.76s)]
*  She called for illegal immigration to be decriminalized. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=311.56s)]
*  She wants free housing, health care and education and now amnesty for her illegal immigrants. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=315.96s)]
*  Over 11 million unvetted, harassed, Biden illegal immigrants in the country and many [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=323.36s)]
*  we now know have terror ties. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  Many come from countries with terror ties. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  Many come from our top geopolitical foes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=334.26000000000005s)]
*  She called Trump's border wall a medieval vanity project. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=337.06s)]
*  She applauded AOC's plan to raise income taxes 70 to 80 percent, called for a mandatory gun [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=341.06s)]
*  confiscation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=348.06s)]
*  She said, there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking and drilling, a disaster [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=349.16s)]
*  for our economy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=354.26s)]
*  It is the lifeblood of the economy of the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=355.66s)]
*  It's called energy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=358.86s)]
*  But take a look at your screen, because suddenly the very moment Kamala was elevated as the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=360.26s)]
*  presumptive Democratic nominee for president, she supposedly now had an epiphany and has [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=366.26s)]
*  abandoned all of her long held, radical, dangerous, left-wing views. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=373.16s)]
*  She even reportedly went full MAGA on the border wall just this week. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=379.16s)]
*  At least that's what the campaign is saying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=383.36s)]
*  Now so far, Kamala has refused to tell us where she stands on almost anything. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=385.96s)]
*  Now if fake news CNN wants to pretend at least to be credible and be a news organization, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=390.36s)]
*  Dana Bash will be playing Kamala in her own words and asking her about all her prior positions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  and all of her alleged flip-flops tomorrow in that interview. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=406.86s)]
*  Don't hold your breath. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=411.66s)]
*  The American people deserve to know whether Kamala wants to turn the American healthcare [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=412.86s)]
*  system into what, the postal service? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=418.1s)]
*  How's that working out for you? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=421.66s)]
*  Isn't Social Security and isn't Medicare headed towards insolvency? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=423.66s)]
*  What happened to that lockbox they always talked about? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=429.16s)]
*  Now the American people deserve to know if Kamala wants to dissolve our border, decriminalize [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=432.26s)]
*  illegal immigration, offer free healthcare, housing and education, you deserve to know [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=438.86s)]
*  how much you will be paying in taxes under Harris-Biden administration, who up to recently [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=444.76s)]
*  was bragging about the great success that is known as Bidenomics. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=450.66s)]
*  She's so proud of it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=454.46s)]
*  You know, one of her stated policy positions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=455.96s)]
*  Kamala is planning some of the largest tax increases in the history, not only of this [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=458.46s)]
*  country but the world, including a doubling of the worldwide corporate minimum tax. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=463.06s)]
*  Well that would put us on par with every other country and we'd have no, companies would [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=468.46s)]
*  have no incentive to come here and create high paying jobs for American citizens. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=473.46s)]
*  And then this insanity and unrealized gain on capital gains. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=480.06s)]
*  In other words, if your stocks, if your property goes up in estimated value, Kamala wants you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=484.06s)]
*  to write a check to the federal government and she wants you to write it today. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=489.66s)]
*  And by the way, if you sell it and you didn't make money on it, do you get your money back? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=493.76s)]
*  Even CNBC was mocking the proposal, humiliating one of Kamala's economic advisors in the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=498.86s)]
*  process. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=504.36s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=505.36s)]
*  Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  Can I make a quick point on that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=511.26000000000005s)]
*  In the very best sense, if you are taxing unrealized gains, all you're doing is pulling [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=512.96s)]
*  forward the taxes that would be paid later when someone actually sells the stock. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=516.46s)]
*  I think that this reaction to unrealized gains is a little funny given that I bet that the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=521.36s)]
*  majority of people watching right now are already paying a tax on unrealized gains. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  It's called a property tax. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=528.96s)]
*  Property tax. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=529.96s)]
*  Property tax is a use tax. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=530.96s)]
*  That's an old, that's an old rule. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=531.96s)]
*  When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't pay it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=532.96s)]
*  Your value of your home never moves the way a stock moves, the way something else moves. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=537.76s)]
*  That's always the go-to answer. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=541.76s)]
*  You're arguing that this is some sort of foreign concept that's completely unknown. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=543.26s)]
*  It's probably unconstitutional. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=546.26s)]
*  And it was never in anyone's intent to tax. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=549.26s)]
*  It's not an income tax. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=554.26s)]
*  And it's never going to happen. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=555.26s)]
*  Probably. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=557.26s)]
*  Now, maybe Kamala's tax on unrealized gains, maybe that's an election ploy, but if it's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=558.26s)]
*  ever implemented, it would be an unmitigated disaster. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=564.96s)]
*  Nobody, nobody, nobody would invest in any business in this country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=568.96s)]
*  All investment would stop a sloppy attempt at class warfare to win votes. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=574.76s)]
*  But here's the thing about Kamala Harris. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=579.76s)]
*  After years as the most liberal person in Washington, D.C., you know, even to the left [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=581.76s)]
*  of Bernie Sanders, which most Americans apparently don't know, we have to assume the worst, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=588.36s)]
*  because especially when Kamala Harris is doing everything under the sun to hide her true [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=594.26s)]
*  policies and beliefs. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=600.36s)]
*  In sharp contrast, we know everything about Donald Trump. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=602.16s)]
*  We know what he believes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=605.76s)]
*  We know what he will do in office every day. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=606.86s)]
*  He's doing interview after interview, press conference after press conference, rally after [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=608.96s)]
*  rally. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=613.86s)]
*  He's all over social media. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=614.86s)]
*  He says what he believes. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=616.02s)]
*  The media criticizes him every day. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=617.02s)]
*  And as the president, he followed through with his promises. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=619.78s)]
*  So if you live in a battleground state, if you're in Georgia, by the way, Governor Kemp [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=623.06s)]
*  is set to host a fundraiser for President Trump. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  Thank God he is. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=629.86s)]
*  You can vote for someone who actually wants to make America safer, more prosperous, more [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=631.26s)]
*  affordable and keep a system that is the greatest wealth-creating system in the world intact. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  It's called capitalism. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=642.26s)]
*  Or you could just roll the dice with a Marxist, leftist, socialist, New Green Deal radical [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=643.26s)]
*  who is left to Bernie Sanders who will do or say anything for personal gain. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=649.86s)]
*  If Kamala really had a plan to make Americans safer, improve your quality of life, she would [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  have done it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=661.26s)]
*  She's on day one, I'm going to work on inflation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=662.26s)]
*  On day one, I'm going to work on the border. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=664.66s)]
*  Well, day one was January 20th of 2021. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=666.66s)]
*  Well, Biden, you know, has checked out on the beach. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=671.46s)]
*  What is she doing now? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=674.7s)]
*  Don't be fooled by these lofty promises. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyYUV786VQ&t=676.14s)]
