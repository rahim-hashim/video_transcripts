# Pete Hegseth will be a 'disrupter and a fighter' as SecDef, GOP senator says
**Fox News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY)
*  Now, while Democrats, while they were running a smear campaign all day on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Tim Sheehy, well, actually asked important questions about the department that Hegseth [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=4.36s)]
*  has been picked to lead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=9.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  How many genders are there? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=12.52s)]
*  Tough one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=13.52s)]
*  Senator, there are two genders. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=14.52s)]
*  I know that well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=15.52s)]
*  I'm a Sheehy, so I'm on board. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=16.52s)]
*  How many rounds of 5.56 can you fit into the magazine of an M4 rifle? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=21.52s)]
*  Depends on the magazine, but standard issues, 30. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=26.360000000000003s)]
*  Senator. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=29.28s)]
*  And what size round is the M9 Beretta standard issue sidearm for the military fire? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  A nine millimeter, Senator. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=35.88s)]
*  What kind of batteries do you put in your night vision goggle? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Duracell. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  So right there, you're representing qualifications that show you understand what the war fighter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  deals with every single day on the battlefield. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=53.92s)]
*  You understand what happens on the front line where our troops will be. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  And what happens, unfortunately, in this country is decisions made in rooms like this, bad [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=61.32s)]
*  decisions end up in dead 17, 18, 19-year-old Americans. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=67.12s)]
*  Those Americans rarely come from families that sit in rooms like this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=71.48s)]
*  All right, here with more, Senator Tim Sheehy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=75.36s)]
*  You know, Senator, some of the allegations, like drinking, for example, there were numerous [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  people that worked every single week with Pete. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=83.0s)]
*  The question about drinking was debunked by every single one of them, number one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=87.08s)]
*  Number two, knowing him myself for as many years as I have, this man eats, breathes, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=92.04s)]
*  sleeps, lives, military, the men and women in combat every single day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=98.48s)]
*  This is his life's passion, his mission. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=103.88s)]
*  Yeah, did he hit a rough road at one point in his life? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=106.68s)]
*  What, nearly a decade ago? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=109.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  He's been upfront, honest, he's moved on, he checked that box, he changed his life. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=112.8s)]
*  Why wasn't there more substance today? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=117.6s)]
*  Well, we all knew it was coming, Sean. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  This is what they did to Clarence Thomas, what they did to Brett Kavanaugh, they did [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=122.6s)]
*  to me during my election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  When they can't argue on policy or substance, when they know that they are wrong with what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=127.32s)]
*  the American people want, this is what the Democrats do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=131.72s)]
*  They resort to smear, anonymous allegations, character assassination, because they know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=134.64s)]
*  they can't talk about the disgrace of the Afghan withdrawal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=139.78s)]
*  They can't talk about the disgraceful state of our military recruitment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=142.92s)]
*  We can't build enough ships, can't build enough planes, we haven't won a war in a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=146.32s)]
*  long time, and our military is spending three times more on DEI initiatives now than we [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=149.54s)]
*  were four years ago. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=154.5s)]
*  So they know that on policy, the U.S. Department of Defense is in tatters right now, and therefore [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=156.14s)]
*  they couldn't spend two seconds talking about policy, and they decided to smear this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  young man, who's going to do a great job, we support him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=166.26s)]
*  And that's why my questions were directed the way they were. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=169.34s)]
*  I wanted to remind people what this job was really about, and it's supporting the warfighter [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=171.34s)]
*  and protecting America. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=175.22s)]
*  It was one of the few moments, along with some other Republicans, of substance, which [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=176.74s)]
*  was desperately needed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=181.06s)]
*  You know, they spent so much time on issues involving identity politics and women in combat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=182.58s)]
*  OK, that's a fair issue. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  And he answered it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  They didn't need to go back again and again and again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  His answer was, yes, I support women in combat, but the standards have to be the same. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=196.38s)]
*  You don't lower standards. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=202.26s)]
*  We had that L.A. firefighter, you know, saying, well, if a guy's stuck in a fire, it's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=204.1s)]
*  too bad, he's in the wrong place, if I have to go pull him out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=208.38s)]
*  That's not a good answer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=212.1s)]
*  Well, I made a very wise life decision, like Pete did, and I married up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=213.1s)]
*  And my wife was a Marine Corps officer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=217.9s)]
*  I'm lucky she spends every day with me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=220.66s)]
*  And she's a combat veteran of Afghanistan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=222.9s)]
*  She'll be the first one to tell you that not only can she do more pull-ups than I can, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=225.84s)]
*  but she would never want to be held to a different standard than any other Marine that she served [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=229.28s)]
*  with. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=233.4s)]
*  And Pete, just like I, have no problem with women in uniform. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=234.4s)]
*  We need them, and they're great warriors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=238.56s)]
*  But we cannot create multiple standards that create a denigration of our ability to fight [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=240.56s)]
*  and win wars. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=246.28s)]
*  And that is exactly what we've seen under Lloyd Austin and Joe Biden's military, is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=247.44s)]
*  combat lethality in the backseat, and they've instead decided to do social engineering with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=252.16s)]
*  our military. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=256.28s)]
*  The results speak for themselves. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=257.28s)]
*  Recruiting is at an all-time low. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=258.76s)]
*  Readiness of our aircraft and ships is at an all-time low. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=260.2s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=262.88s)]
*  We had the greatest military failure in Afghanistan in a generation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=263.88s)]
*  So we need a new generation of leaders across the board, but especially in this department. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=266.94s)]
*  And we need somebody like Pete who's going to be a disruptor, he's going to be a fighter, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=271.04s)]
*  and he's going to look at things outside the box. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=274.4s)]
*  We've been thinking inside the box, Sean, for way too long, and look where it's gotten [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=276.12s)]
*  us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=279.24s)]
*  Senator, will he be confirmed? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=280.32s)]
*  I believe he will. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=282.88s)]
*  You know, we haven't obviously voted yet, but I think he's got the support he needs, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=283.88s)]
*  and he's got my support. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=287.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=288.2s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=289.2s)]
*  I thought you were very substantive today, and we needed it in light of everything else [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=290.48s)]
*  going on in that room. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=295.72s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=296.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMW7DNwWFlY&t=297.72s)]
