# Hannity: 'Operation dump and destroy Biden' is underway
**Fox News:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU)
*  Right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=0.0s)]
*  What we just witnessed was a typical, strange, bizarre, unpredictable day with a president [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=1.0s)]
*  who's in cognitive decline, who we have known has been in cognitive decline since the election [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=12.72s)]
*  Joe was high energy, he was low energy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=14.08s)]
*  He was yelling, he was whispering, a lot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=16.56s)]
*  Maybe not as tongue-tied as normal, okay, plus for Joe. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=19.76s)]
*  But very strange, very bizarre, as we have been chronicling on this program for four [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  straight years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=29.24s)]
*  This is why the big lie and cover-up is so dangerous and has been so insidious for the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=30.84s)]
*  country and frankly for the world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=36.76s)]
*  We have been showing you this for years, and all of them, all the Democrats, the state-run [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=39.0s)]
*  media mob, they all lied, they all covered it up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=44.8s)]
*  Biden was defiant tonight, clearly has no intention of leaving this race, and yet at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  one point it appeared he did leave the door open a little bit to be replaced at the convention. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=53.68s)]
*  I don't believe that for a second. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=58.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=60.36000000000001s)]
*  If I may, your convention is coming up where your delegates are pledged to make you the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=61.36000000000001s)]
*  official nominee. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=65.0s)]
*  If they have second thoughts, are they free to vote their conscience? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=66.68s)]
*  Obviously they're free to do whatever they want, but I get overwhelming support, overwhelming [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=70.76s)]
*  support. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  I won, I forget how many votes I won in the primary, overwhelming. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  And so tomorrow, if all of a sudden I show up at the convention, everybody says, we want [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  somebody else. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=87.76s)]
*  That's the democratic process. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=88.76s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=89.76s)]
*  Even if that means they vote for someone else? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=90.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=91.76s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=92.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=93.76s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=94.76s)]
*  But regardless of what the president says or does, Operation Dump and Destroy Joe Biden [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=95.76s)]
*  is officially underway. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=107.28s)]
*  And the floodgates, they are now wide open. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  According to Politico, behind the scenes, well, there's a guy by the name of Barack [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Hussein Obama. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=116.6s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=117.6s)]
*  He's now given a green light to Pelosi, to Schumer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=118.6s)]
*  He signed off on George Clooney's New York Times op-ed and everyone else in the Democratic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=121.56s)]
*  Party to try and kick Joe to the curb. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=126.24s)]
*  Fake News CNN now reporting, in fact, and confirming that Obama and Pelosi have had [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=130.0s)]
*  at least one private conversation about getting Joe out of the race. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=134.84s)]
*  That would explain her comments on MSDNC. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=139.0s)]
*  So will Joe Biden make it past the convention? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=142.16s)]
*  Will he even be president next month, next week, tomorrow? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=144.84s)]
*  He certainly seems to think so. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=148.44s)]
*  Now, of course, the sad truth is Biden really has not been the president. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  He has suffered from a steep cognitive decline, getting progressively worse. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=155.4s)]
*  It is degenerative. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=159.74s)]
*  It never gets better since at least 2019. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=160.74s)]
*  And for more than, you know, three and a half years, going on four years, the state-run [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=164.24s)]
*  media mob, the Democratic Party, have been lying to all of you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  It's a collusion and a conspiracy of historic proportions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  In fact, I would say that the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  This is the biggest cover-up in American history, especially as it relates to the presidency. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=180.12s)]
*  Maybe Woodrow Wilson's right up there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=185.12s)]
*  In the meantime, the U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=187.4s)]
*  government was run by a cabal of far-left, unelected bureaucrats, Cabinet officials, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  without any substantial direction from the so-called president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  According to a new bombshell story, Biden has not conducted a single Cabinet meeting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=197.84s)]
*  all year, not one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Last time I checked, it's July. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  Prior high-level meetings were reportedly scripted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=206.24s)]
*  Questions, concerns submitted in advance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=209.24s)]
*  It's apparently, you know, giving the questions to interviewers ahead of time, been a regular [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  practice for years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=217.84s)]
*  One source telling Fake News CNN, the entire display is kind of an act. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=219.5s)]
*  As you can see, Joe Biden is little more than a frontman pretending to be your president [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=224.62s)]
*  while following the orders during, you know, these rare, heavily-scripted public appearances, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=229.78s)]
*  as Biden's closest advisors, his family, all obviously attempted to hide this cognitive [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=235.66s)]
*  decline, but they all knew, and every Democrat knew, and everyone in the media knew, this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  is an unprecedented scandal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=247.02s)]
*  We need to get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=248.78s)]
*  It's an egregious affront. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=250.62s)]
*  You talk about a threat to democracy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=252.06s)]
*  This is a threat to democracy, all from the party that claims to care so much about the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=253.8s)]
*  people and the democratic process. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  In reality, the only thing that's bothering them is they're about to lose power. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=262.16s)]
*  They just want power in perpetuity. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=266.6s)]
*  So now that a Biden loss looks inevitable, they are once again attempting to disenfranchise [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=268.8s)]
*  Americans by pushing Biden to the curb after all these people in all these states went [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=274.64s)]
*  and voted for him, and he secured more than enough primary votes to win his party's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=282.04s)]
*  nomination. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=287.24s)]
*  The Democratic establishment, the media mob, state-run media, were hoping tonight's press [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=288.24s)]
*  conference would totally, completely humiliate Joe Biden and force him to step down or, at [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  the very least, give high-ranking Democrats the political ammunition they need to publicly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=298.76s)]
*  call for Joe's resignation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=303.12s)]
*  Clay Travis put it pretty well. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=305.76s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=307.68s)]
*  That is, happening, Democrats are chumming the waters with blood and sending Joe Biden [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=308.96s)]
*  in for a swim. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=313.96s)]
*  They want the media to end him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=315.84s)]
*  Well, I don't think Joe Biden got the message. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, so how did Biden do it, his so-called big boy press conference? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=320.68s)]
*  The nation—you know, and this is the sad part, but this is not just tonight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  This has been going on for years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=329.96s)]
*  Every time Joe speaks, especially extemporaneously, the nation is on pins and needles. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  The world is on pins and needles. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=338.56s)]
*  And by the way, our enemies—you know, President Xi and Putin, the mullahs in Iran and Kim [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=340.98s)]
*  Jong-un are doing backflips, because whenever Joe appears in public, especially after four, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=346.0s)]
*  you have no idea who's coming. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=351.2s)]
*  It's a different Biden that shows up every time, and it can change like this, like it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=353.08s)]
*  did tonight. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=357.36s)]
*  You never know what you're going to get. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=358.56s)]
*  Tonight, before taking any questions, we saw a very animated, even at times angry, you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=360.56s)]
*  know, high-energy Joe Biden. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=365.92s)]
*  And we're starting out with, frankly, a series of blatant lies. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=368.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=371.84s)]
*  So I took executive action last month. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=372.84s)]
*  As a consequence, working with Mexico, border encounters have gone down over 50 percent. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=375.84s)]
*  The current level is lower today than when Trump left office. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=383.24s)]
*  Just this morning, we had a great economic report showing inflation is down. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=388.8s)]
*  Tax fell last month. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=395.4s)]
*  Core inflation is the lowest it's been in three years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=397.32s)]
*  Prices are falling for cars, appliances and airfare—airfares. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  Grocery prices have fallen since the start of the year. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Inflation has been up every month this year, month over month, over 3 percent, and it went [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  up this month by 3 percent. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  Not down. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  Inflation up by more than 20-plus percent under Biden. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  He inherited 1.4 percent. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=419.64s)]
*  Nearly 100,000 illegal immigrants were processed and released this month alone. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=422.4s)]
*  That is far above Donald Trump's 2020 numbers. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  So now let's dive to the question and answer part of the press conference. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=430.56s)]
*  OK, everyone's on pins and needles, but it's been that way for years. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=433.96s)]
*  As it turns out, this wasn't a big boy presser at all. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=438.64s)]
*  You know, when he has a press conference, it shouldn't be like, you know, watching [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=442.92s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith before a big game and you're wondering what's going to happen next. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  But that's how much drama is created because of his cognitive decline that everybody's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=452.36s)]
*  known about and covered up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  But apparently his staff preselected all the reporters. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=461.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=462.68s)]
*  With that, I'll take your questions. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=463.68s)]
*  I've been given a list of people to call on here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  Reuters, Jeff Mason. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  And despite a carefully crafted list of friendly reporters, Biden still struggled at times. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=474.28s)]
*  Maybe not as bad as usual. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  Maybe this was for him actually better than normal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=483.84s)]
*  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president, though I think [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=484.84s)]
*  she was not qualified to be president. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=490.32s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=492.55999999999995s)]
*  Look, folks, this is a. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=493.84s)]
*  Well, anyway, I thought it was the most successful conference I've attended in a long time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=496.0s)]
*  I mean, economists, mainstream economists have said we haven't done well. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=505.12s)]
*  What have we not done that isn't working right now? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=508.08s)]
*  I was told not to go over to Europe. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=510.8s)]
*  I mean, to Asia, including Europe, but Asia. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=512.84s)]
*  I remember going to South Korea instead of starting a fundraiser at nine o'clock, started [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=515.64s)]
*  at eight o'clock. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=521.64s)]
*  People get to go home by 10 o'clock. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=523.16s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=525.48s)]
*  I'm not talking about. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=526.48s)]
*  And if you look to my schedule, since I've since I made that stupid mistake of in the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=527.48s)]
*  campaign and the debate, I mean, my schedule has been full bore. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=533.2s)]
*  I love my staff, but they add things, add things all the time. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm catching hell from my wife for that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=546.08s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=548.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=555.76s)]
*  Zeke Miller, Associated Press. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=557.36s)]
*  And so our military is where I'm following the advice of my commander in chief, my chief [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=559.44s)]
*  of staff of the military. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  We bring on a group from the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Australia. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  I already mentioned Australia. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=577.48s)]
*  Joe, what if the phone rings at 3 a.m.? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=582.08s)]
*  For Joe, this was definitely better than maybe the average day. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=586.36s)]
*  OK, we'll give him a little, we'll give him a prop. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=589.84s)]
*  But the ups, the downs, the peaks, the valleys are shaking this nation and have been for [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=591.88s)]
*  years to its core. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=597.72s)]
*  It is shaking the world to its core. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=600.0s)]
*  Starts out high energy by the end, he's clearly fading. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=603.24s)]
*  Get him off the stage. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  Hurry up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  He can't handle this. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  Then the whispering, then the yelling. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=609.98s)]
*  This has been the last four years, and Democrats and the media mob, state-run media, they just [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  lied and covered up for him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=617.36s)]
*  That is what everybody needs to take away from all of this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=620.04s)]
*  For example, earlier today, he whispered his way through a meeting with Britain's new [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=622.7399999999999s)]
*  prime minister, looked completely out of that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=626.66s)]
*  He then, by the way, struggled with a standard office chair at a NATO meeting. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=629.18s)]
*  Later, perhaps even worst of all, he introduced the Ukrainian prime minister, Zelensky, accidentally [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=634.06s)]
*  calling him, whoopsie daisy, President Putin. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=640.9399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine who has as much courage as he has [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=645.0200000000001s)]
*  determination. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=650.5s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=651.5s)]
*  President Putin. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=653.7s)]
*  He's going to beat President Putin. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=654.7s)]
*  President Zelensky. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=658.7s)]
*  I'm so focused on beating Putin, we got to worry about it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=659.7s)]
*  Anyway, Mr. President. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=663.82s)]
*  I'm better. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=664.82s)]
*  You are a hell of a lot better. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=665.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=668.82s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=671.82s)]
*  Now, the odds of Biden making it to the convention, I don't know. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=672.9000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=676.0200000000001s)]
*  I do know Operation Destroy and Takeout, Joe Biden is underway. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=677.7s)]
*  That there's no doubt about. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=685.1400000000001s)]
*  But you know, look, he luckily maybe had a little better day than usual, and that's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=686.6600000000001s)]
*  the best you're going to get. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=691.82s)]
*  Starting tonight, here's what you should expect. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=693.22s)]
*  Even more high-level Democrats publicly calling for Joe to step down. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=695.74s)]
*  His party has abandoned him. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=699.8s)]
*  And don't expect Joe to go quietly. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=702.0s)]
*  That was very evident tonight. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=704.28s)]
*  He's not going to go into the night and say, bye-bye, okay, I'm going to listen, everybody. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=706.04s)]
*  He doesn't seem to really care about his party. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=711.52s)]
*  It's long been known that he and Obama don't really like each other anyway. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=714.04s)]
*  So Operation Dump and Destroy, Joe Biden, is not going to impact him. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=717.68s)]
*  He believes his higher calling is his fame, his power and his family. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=724.0s)]
*  Joe has dreamed of being president his entire life. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=728.16s)]
*  His wife clearly loves the status as first lady. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=730.9s)]
*  The Bidens have made it big. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=733.8s)]
*  They're not going to give it up because of public pressure. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=736.36s)]
*  And Democratic elites or Hollywood elites, they'll have to drag him and Jill and Hunter [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=739.56s)]
*  out of the White House kicking and screaming, or at least, that's my prediction. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  No one really knows what tomorrow will hold for the Democratic Party. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=748.52s)]
*  But it is an unmitigated disaster of their own making. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=752.36s)]
*  They lied over and over again. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=755.66s)]
*  They disrespected their own voters. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=757.44s)]
*  They trampled on our Constitution. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=759.6s)]
*  And now they are reaping what they sow. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=761.86s)]
*  Regardless, whoever to replace him, they still would adopt the same radical policies. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=764.08s)]
*  The path forward for Democrats is challenging, to say the least. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=770.0s)]
*  But we are 116 days away from Election Day, 67 days away from early voting that begins [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  Buckle up. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  It's going to be, well, a turbulent ride. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  Prepare for a tight race in November. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead7WJ8b_vU&t=786.92s)]
