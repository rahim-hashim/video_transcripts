# Sean Hannity: These are serious times
**Fox News:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE)
*  Look, these are serious times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=0.0s)]
*  And if these illegals that are unvetted get into this country and they kill Americans, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=2.68s)]
*  they will have blood on their hands, just like they do over every American that has [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=7.08s)]
*  been murdered and raped by unvetted Harris-Biden illegals, over 11 million from over 180 countries [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=11.64s)]
*  they have allowed into our country, the illegals that Kamala wants to decriminalize, provide [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=18.48s)]
*  free housing, healthcare, education, now taxpayer-funded sex changes and amnesty on top of it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=23.46s)]
*  These policies are extreme. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  They are radical. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=32.0s)]
*  They are dangerous. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=33.0s)]
*  This is a presidential candidate who actually called on Americans to have the courage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Think of this, 9-11-01, 23 years ago, and she's saying, we need to have the courage [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=38.64s)]
*  to stop using the term radical Islamic terrorism and the illegal alien. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=43.86s)]
*  As America's borders are, radical extremists, Kamala Harris, she is solely responsible for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=49.34s)]
*  letting people with terror ties and these criminals that have committed murder and rape [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=55.18s)]
*  and other violent crimes and gangs to pour into our country from all over the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=60.66s)]
*  Now, during last night's debate, we didn't hear Kamala on the border crisis or so many [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=66.38s)]
*  other important issues. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=71.24s)]
*  How is it possible we didn't get an answer on Kamala's plan to decriminalize illegal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=72.94s)]
*  immigration and offer all of these taxpayer-funded benefits or her flip-flops on the border wall [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=78.06s)]
*  that she laughed at as a vanity project and defunding ICE? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=84.86s)]
*  Now, we knew about her taxpayer-funded healthcare, housing, education, amnesty plans, but think [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=89.02s)]
*  about this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=94.38s)]
*  Taxpayers, that's all of you, funded gender reassignment surgery for illegal immigrants [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=95.38s)]
*  and convicts. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=102.13999999999999s)]
*  How is it possible we didn't get a straight answer on the $93 trillion Green New Deal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  that she would eliminate the filibuster to pass and that she co-sponsored with Bernie [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=109.78s)]
*  Sanders or government-run healthcare and the elimination of all private health insurance? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  Again, both bills she co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders or her very radical statement in August [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  23 that we call it Bidenomics and she's very proud of it or the fact that we have inflation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=128.82s)]
*  that has been over 20 percent since she's been in office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=135.74s)]
*  I'm going to fix this on day one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  Okay, day one was a long time ago. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=140.7s)]
*  Or radical proposals to raise taxes through the roof, including unrealized capital gains? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=143.38s)]
*  Even Mark Cuban realizes that'll ruin the economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=149.06s)]
*  How is it possible last night ABC Disney didn't demand an answer on Kamala's support [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=152.18s)]
*  of defund, dismantle, no bail? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=158.58s)]
*  How is it possible not a single question about Kamala's promotion of a bail fund that got [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=161.46s)]
*  violent offenders and rioters out of jail? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=166.86s)]
*  Nearly 600 riots in the summer of 2020 and she says the rioters won't stop, shouldn't stop, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  and she won't stop supporting these rioters and insurrectionists? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=176.62s)]
*  ABC Disney, they weren't interested in holding Kamala's feet to the fire because their CEO, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  Bob Iger, is heir apparent as well, ABC Disney, they want Kamala Harris to be elected. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=187.9s)]
*  Well, that was very clear last night. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=193.66s)]
*  In fact, last night was little more than a campaign contribution by ABC Disney [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=195.26s)]
*  masquerading as a news division, which they are not, all while supporting the Harris campaign. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=201.02s)]
*  ABC News is a left-wing, woke, leftist talk network, but they're not honest. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=206.38s)]
*  In what was the most overt, sickening display of left-wing bias during a presidential debate, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=212.94s)]
*  the so-called moderators barely asked the vice president about any massive flip-flops, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  changes in position only since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=224.86s)]
*  never once followed up on when she failed to provide a straight answer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=229.9s)]
*  Does she or does she not support any restrictions on late-term abortion? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=235.34s)]
*  I'd still like to know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=239.74s)]
*  You know, in contrast, former President Trump got nothing but hostile treatment from the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=241.18s)]
*  moderators, constant follow-ups, fact checks, gotcha question, kind of like this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=245.1s)]
*  There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=251.66s)]
*  Madam Vice President, I want to get your response to President Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=256.14s)]
*  ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=258.94s)]
*  He told us there had been no credible reports. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=261.26s)]
*  The Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you've heard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=265.82s)]
*  President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is actually coming down [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=268.14s)]
*  in this country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=272.22s)]
*  The question was about you as president, not about former Speaker Pelosi, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=272.94000000000005s)]
*  but I do want Vice President Harris to respond here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=276.14000000000004s)]
*  Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=278.3s)]
*  That's absolutely not true. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  You said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=283.1s)]
*  Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=284.94000000000005s)]
*  Can you clarify tonight? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  Just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  All right, so guess how many times these moderators fact-checked Kamala Harris? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=291.98s)]
*  Zero. Not once. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=296.3s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=297.5s)]
*  She lied over and over and over again. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  Just take a look at your screen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=300.94s)]
*  She lied about Project 25, lied about the very fine people hoax in Charlottesville [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=302.46s)]
*  that even left-wing snopes called out as a lie, said it was bogus. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=308.46s)]
*  She also lied about Trump's sales tax. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=312.78s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=314.94s)]
*  Lied about a nationwide abortion ban Trump has never supported. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=316.22s)]
*  Lied about Trump wanting to ban in vitro fertilization [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=320.46s)]
*  when in reality he supports federal assistance for IVF. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=323.98s)]
*  She lied about Trump's role in Afghanistan, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=328.46s)]
*  when the withdrawal, she lied about the bogus border bill. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=330.78s)]
*  And as you can see, it goes on and on and on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=333.9s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  David Muir, Lindsey Davis, they were pathetic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=337.5s)]
*  The fact checks only went one way against Donald Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  David Muir, Lindsey Davis, Bob Iger, the entire ABC Disney organization. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  They, it was a complete disservice to the country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=348.7s)]
*  You know, nearly 60 days in, we don't know whether she still supports [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  all of her stated radical positions, positions that we have in her own words. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=355.82s)]
*  Why? Because they just hate Donald Trump that much. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=360.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris didn't win a single primary vote, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=363.26s)]
*  has participated in one interview. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  She has held zero press conferences, no town halls. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=368.46s)]
*  The policy positions on her website basically copied and pasted from the Biden campaign [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=371.74s)]
*  that she says she's trying to distance herself from. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=377.74s)]
*  With so few specifics, depending on the audience, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=380.78s)]
*  her views seem to drastically change. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  For example, here's a, here's Kamala, a mandatory gun buyback. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=390.38s)]
*  This business about taking everyone's guns away. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=391.82s)]
*  Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=394.54s)]
*  We're not taking anybody's guns away. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=396.06s)]
*  So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=397.74s)]
*  I support buybacks and I think that we have five million assault weapons [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=401.18s)]
*  on the streets of America. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=406.78s)]
*  How mandatory is your gun buyback program? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=408.14s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=410.7s)]
*  Second Amendment? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=412.54s)]
*  Second Amendment? Listen, we have to, we're gonna have to do it the right way. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=413.74s)]
*  She was lying when she spoke out in favor of these mandatory buybacks over and over again. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=417.42s)]
*  Or is she lying now? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  And what about fracking and drilling? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=423.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  I made that very clear in 2020. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=429.18s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=431.18s)]
*  I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=432.86s)]
*  And in fact, I was the tie breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=435.58s)]
*  which opened new leases for fracking. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=440.46s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=443.66s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=450.14s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=454.46s)]
*  No question she was in favor of banning fracking and still is. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=459.1s)]
*  She was lying then or is she lying now? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=462.3s)]
*  Do you believe her? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=465.1s)]
*  What about the, you know, government health care, Medicare for all bill [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=466.06s)]
*  that she co-sponsored with Bernie in the Senate? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=469.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=472.14s)]
*  Vice President Harris, in 2017, you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=473.42s)]
*  insurance and create a government-run health care system. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=478.38s)]
*  Two years later, you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=481.1s)]
*  What is your plan today? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, first of all, I absolutely support, and over the last four years as vice president, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=486.86s)]
*  private health care options. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=491.74s)]
*  You support the Medicare for all bill, I think, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=493.02s)]
*  initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=495.18s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor on it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=497.34000000000003s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=498.94s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=505.58s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=513.9s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you got to wait for approval and the doctor says, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=518.3s)]
*  well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=525.5s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  So did she co-sponsor the bill? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=527.9000000000001s)]
*  She didn't actually support it? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=530.22s)]
*  Or is she lying? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=532.22s)]
*  That brings us to the border. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=533.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=534.7800000000001s)]
*  So does the borders are that allowed, what, 11 million illegal immigrants to pour into this country [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=557.82s)]
*  unvetted, really care about border security? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=586.62s)]
*  Was she lying in the debate and using a deeply flawed political bill that would allow 4,000, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=589.18s)]
*  5,000 illegals in before it even kicked in and then it was discretionary? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=594.4599999999999s)]
*  The answer is obvious. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  And as reported by Fake News CNN, Kamala previously vowed to end the detention of illegal immigrants, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=600.06s)]
*  decrease funding for ICE, end ICE detainers, force you to cover the bill for transgender surgeries [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=606.4599999999999s)]
*  for illegal immigrants and convicts in jail. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=613.26s)]
*  These are radical beliefs and they don't just magically change overnight. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=616.62s)]
*  Kamala's new vague policy positions mysteriously adopted only after she became the nominee are [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=621.26s)]
*  about as fake as her weird faces that she was making during last night's debate. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  There is nothing authentic about the Harris campaign. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=632.22s)]
*  This is a candidate in the in the media mob protection program and she literally, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=635.58s)]
*  threw her name on every socialist bill in the Senate and dissolved America's borders during [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=642.7s)]
*  her time as vice president and border czar. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  But now she'll do and say anything she needs to do or say to win and advance her career, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  even if that means throwing her cognitively impaired boss under the bus. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=655.74s)]
*  And right on cue, look who just boarded the Trump train. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=659.82s)]
*  This was funny earlier today in Pennsylvania, the president himself, Joe Biden, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=663.4200000000001s)]
*  donned a red Trump 2024 hat in front of a crowd in Shanksville and a fire station. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=667.6600000000001s)]
*  The White House said he did it to show bipartisan unity on 9-11. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=674.22s)]
*  Kamala's campaign is probably not very happy about the gesture, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  but Biden really doesn't hate Kamala after all, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=682.5400000000001s)]
*  Who could blame him if he does? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=686.94s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ84d-tzYeE&t=697.58s)]
