# How Trumpâ€™s win in Iowa will shake up the 2024 presidential race
**Fox News:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco)
*  We'll bring those to you live when he takes the stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=0.0s)]
*  First, joining us now, the co-hosts of the hit show, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=2.16s)]
*  The Five, in America's newsroom. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=4.84s)]
*  She's got double duty. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=6.84s)]
*  I was on with her today, Dana Perino, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=8.16s)]
*  along with our fellow co-host of The Five, Harold Ford Jr. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I work for Dana, so I'm glad to be here with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=13.68s)]
*  The crowd favorite. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=15.88s)]
*  By the way, I cannot fill in for Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=16.72s)]
*  I'm not as funny as Greg. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=18.92s)]
*  I'm not as funny as Jimmy Fallon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=20.04s)]
*  You're taller than Greg, though. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=21.36s)]
*  Well, there's always an upside. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=23.48s)]
*  And he's taller than me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=24.92s)]
*  Well, you're both great. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=26.72s)]
*  All right, let's get you just simple analysis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=28.56s)]
*  What happened today? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=30.56s)]
*  One of the things I love about our coverage [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=32.68s)]
*  is that you have these people out there talking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=34.4s)]
*  so that any viewer can tune in and see [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=36.24s)]
*  a real live focus group. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=39.04s)]
*  What's really on people's minds? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=40.76s)]
*  We can talk about the polls all we want. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=42.12s)]
*  I thought it was very interesting how many people are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=43.8s)]
*  bringing up education. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=45.72s)]
*  They're bringing up these back to basic issues. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=47.2s)]
*  Gutfeld talked about that today on The Five as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=49.16s)]
*  That they just want government to work well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  They're not asking for government [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=53.6s)]
*  to solve their problems. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=55.08s)]
*  They want to pay their taxes and make [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  sure that the roads are taken care of, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=58.28s)]
*  that the schools are taken care of, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=60.52s)]
*  and that their national security is taken care of. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  And they don't want the government [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=64.04s)]
*  to get in the way of the economy being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=65.24s)]
*  able to work in a supply and demand, market [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=67.12s)]
*  forces kind of way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=70.56s)]
*  That's the way that I see this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=71.68s)]
*  I also think that President Trump, if you look [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  at that screenshot right now, his stage presence, one [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=75.0s)]
*  we know is very good, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=79.92s)]
*  The charisma, the politics, but the experience [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  of having been president and then now running again. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=83.84s)]
*  Now, he didn't debate, but he has been here in Iowa. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=86.48s)]
*  He has shown up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=89.16s)]
*  He's going to give some remarks tonight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=89.8s)]
*  And he goes into this with a strong gust of wind [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=91.56s)]
*  at his back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=94.6s)]
*  And it shows. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=95.64s)]
*  And that kind of a scene right there, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  that's a good advance team. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=98.52s)]
*  Harold Ford, Jr., when we first met, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=101.56s)]
*  you were a congressman from the great state of Tennessee. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=103.44s)]
*  You now live in New York. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=106.68s)]
*  And I believe New York City. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=108.28s)]
*  And you pay about 13% income tax. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=109.64s)]
*  There's no need to remind me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=113.08s)]
*  Yeah, we know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=114.24s)]
*  Now, if you were in Tennessee, you would pay zero. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=115.2s)]
*  An amazing disparity in terms of political philosophy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  I thought that I tried to highlight that when Governor [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=122.88s)]
*  DeSantis debated Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  There is a divide. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=128.6s)]
*  I don't know how we reconcile on issues of the economy, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=130.16s)]
*  on foreign policy, on immigration, on energy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=133.16s)]
*  I don't even see any middle ground anymore. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=136.4s)]
*  As a Democrat, as you look at this, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=140.44s)]
*  what's going on from your perspective? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=142.72s)]
*  First, thanks for having me on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=144.36s)]
*  I agree with Dana. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=145.56s)]
*  I think when you chime into Sarah and others [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=146.36s)]
*  and you listen to people, you were [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=149.36s)]
*  commenting while she was there that these are just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  bread and butter things. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  I think, to Greg's point on the show today, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  our politics is broken. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=157.84s)]
*  And when the politics is broken, everything that stems from it, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=159.24s)]
*  our borders broken, our schools are broken, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=161.96s)]
*  our workplaces are broken in many ways. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=163.8s)]
*  Even our places of worship are broken. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  So when you look at those things, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  millions of Americans' lives are in disrepair and are broken. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  If you're a Democrat tonight, I think [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  you don't extrapolate so, so much from an Iowa Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=174.28s)]
*  coalition or caucus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=179.0s)]
*  I mean, what you do extrapolate from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  is what everyday people are saying. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=181.88s)]
*  You had parents in that diner. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  You had people who were a little older, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=186.36s)]
*  people were a little younger. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Then that last guy, who I thought [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  was so interesting, said, we just wanted to work. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=190.16s)]
*  It can't, to your point, Dana, we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=192.4s)]
*  don't need you to solve everything, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  but you can't pass a budget on time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  Staring in your face is a porous border. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=196.96s)]
*  No one can come together to work on that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=199.08s)]
*  We're finding ourselves engaged in fights overseas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  We're working on helping our friends in Ukraine [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=204.16s)]
*  and helping our friends, the Israelis. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=206.4s)]
*  Let's get government back to working again. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=208.44s)]
*  And whichever candidate is able to do that, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=210.4s)]
*  be it Joe Biden or Donald Trump, looks [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=213.36s)]
*  like they will be our nominees. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=216.04s)]
*  And this is going to be the longest race [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=217.52s)]
*  we've ever seen for president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=218.96s)]
*  This thing will probably get started [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=220.16s)]
*  March 1st at the latest. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=221.36s)]
*  We all know who they are. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=222.8s)]
*  It's not like something's going to come up on Tuesday [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  and Wednesday about Trump or Biden. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=225.88s)]
*  So we may get a race about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=227.4s)]
*  Do you not believe that there's some grand scheme [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  to get Biden off the ticket? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  Go away from being off the ticket. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=231.84s)]
*  I know no one's wishing that, but I know your point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=233.28s)]
*  I'm not wishing it, I'm saying. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  But if they're the two, we may find ourselves [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=237.12s)]
*  with one of the great substantive issue-based debates [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=240.08s)]
*  that we've seen in a while. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=243.28s)]
*  Because they're going to have to, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=244.4s)]
*  one's been president already and one's president now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=245.84s)]
*  So they can talk about their records, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=248.0s)]
*  not what they would do, but what they did [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=249.28s)]
*  and what they would do going forward. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think the country, as much as three quarters [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=252.84s)]
*  of the country don't want either of them as a nominee, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  if you look at the polling data, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  if they are the nominees, I always try to look at things [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=258.76s)]
*  in the most favorable light. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=261.08s)]
*  In the most favorable light in this census, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=262.44s)]
*  they may have to talk about issues [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=263.96s)]
*  in ways that other candidates may not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  I've got to ask you the question that I ask everybody, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=266.44s)]
*  every Democrat that comes on the show. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you really believe that Joe Biden [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=271.8s)]
*  is physically strong enough, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=273.36s)]
*  cognitively strong enough to be the president? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=275.52s)]
*  Because I do not believe that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  He's been president for four years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  The answer to your question is yes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=282.24s)]
*  Am I in a box of people when mine's seeing another person, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=284.56s)]
*  another Democrat emerge? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=288.0s)]
*  That may happen at some point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  And if you look at the polling data for the country, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=291.48s)]
*  two out of three Democrats want that to be the case. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=293.12s)]
*  But we, I think even two out of three out of four Republicans [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  want someone different, but we may be stuck with these two. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  And we've got to figure out what's the best thing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  that can come out of this for the country. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=302.6s)]
*  So if you look at the Fox eggs and polls, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=303.68s)]
*  we've been running polls for seven days straight. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  You look at the ABC poll, Joe Biden at 33%. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=308.56s)]
*  He is losing dramatic support [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=311.48s)]
*  among every key major demographic [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  of the Democratic party or the Democratic base. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  If those numbers even, if 20% of those numbers hold, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=319.8s)]
*  that would be a landslide victory [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=323.84s)]
*  if it's Trump versus Biden this year. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=325.8s)]
*  How real do you believe that is in the end, Dana? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=330.24s)]
*  Very, and also in that same ABC poll, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=333.12s)]
*  they asked a question about cognitive abilities. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=335.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. They didn't come out well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=337.96s)]
*  And it was 28%. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=340.56s)]
*  And I disagree. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=341.32s)]
*  I don't think you'll have the most substantive campaign [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=342.12s)]
*  because President Biden has already said [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=344.48s)]
*  his campaign is going to be against MAGA extremists [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=346.56s)]
*  and against Donald Trump as a person. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=349.88s)]
*  And you might see that from the other side as well, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=352.0s)]
*  that Trump is going to wonder what Biden would actually do [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=354.72s)]
*  in the future if he could do anything at all. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=358.04s)]
*  But I think we'll tire of that debate. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=360.52s)]
*  Think about this. Well, for sure. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=362.6s)]
*  The economy is always, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=363.64s)]
*  if we find ourselves at Memorial Day [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=365.16s)]
*  and gas prices are really high, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=367.28s)]
*  that impacts adversely an incumbent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=368.68s)]
*  And if the incumbent has that, he's going to have to figure out, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=371.2s)]
*  how am I going to get these prices lower? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=373.44s)]
*  If things are lower and the economy is improving, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=374.8s)]
*  it's going to be a common pun if it's Donald Trump. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=376.88s)]
*  What he did in 22 was raid the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=378.84s)]
*  which he did on purpose for politics. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=381.84s)]
*  But he's not going to change the border. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=383.84s)]
*  And so if all the people... [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=385.44s)]
*  That's the issue. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=386.28s)]
*  ...come around the border... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=387.0s)]
*  I've got to go to Hitler at the big point. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=387.64s)]
*  I agree with you. I agree with Dana 100%. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you the whole Joe Biden campaign. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=390.24s)]
*  It's going to be the normal playbook. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=391.8s)]
*  Republicans are racist, sexist. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Hitler. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  They have every phobia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Hitler. OK. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=396.36s)]
*  Democracy in peril. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=397.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, January 6. That's it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=399.4s)]
*  That won't work. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=401.48s)]
*  That won't work alone. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=402.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  He's going to have to talk about the border and the economy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=404.24s)]
*  And if you don't talk about those things... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=405.8s)]
*  How does he talk about the border without being laughed at? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=407.0s)]
*  Well, you've got to get between now and March. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  You've got to get down there and do something about it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=411.48s)]
*  I've been saying this for a long time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  If we don't do something there, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=414.04s)]
*  it's bad for the country and worse for my party. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC1yOm4Pco&t=415.12s)]
