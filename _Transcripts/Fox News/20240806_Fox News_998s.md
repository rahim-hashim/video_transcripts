# Hannity: Kamala Harris taps the most radical, far-left governor to be her running mate
**Fox News:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk)
*  All right, buckle up and welcome to Hannity in case there was any doubt in your mind, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=0.0s)]
*  any doubt whatsoever. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=9.44s)]
*  Well, tonight, full confirmation that yes, the Democratic presidential nominee Kamala [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=10.76s)]
*  Harris is the single most radical, extreme and downright dangerous far left politician [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=16.12s)]
*  ever coronated by the Democratic party. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=22.46s)]
*  Now, she just tapped Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the single most radical far left governor [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=25.0s)]
*  in the United States to be her running mate. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=30.92s)]
*  Make no mistake, Harrison Walz, they're political soulmates. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=33.2s)]
*  Walz is the Bernie Sanders of Democratic governors. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  He has extreme position on everything. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  He was a champion of woke politics. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=44.32s)]
*  We'll go into great detail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=46.28s)]
*  He has a track record of scandal, dishonesty, failure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=48.2s)]
*  He has deep decades long ties to China. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=52.0s)]
*  And as much as he loves calling J.D. Vance weird, he's pretty weird. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=56.56s)]
*  It appears that Walz was throwing stones at a very glass house. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=61.56s)]
*  So tonight we are going to do what the state-run media mob will not do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=65.84s)]
*  We are going to vet the extremely weird radical Tim Walz in detail. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=69.34s)]
*  Now, coming up, Donald Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio will join us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=74.4s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will join us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=79.88s)]
*  And then later, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=81.92s)]
*  But let us begin with Governor Walz's crowning achievement, allowing entire neighborhoods [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=84.96s)]
*  and a police precinct in his own state to be burned straight to the ground during the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=91.36s)]
*  riots in the summer of 2020. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=96.78s)]
*  And he sat by and he did nothing, absolutely nothing, for days and days. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=99.14s)]
*  J.D. Vance, he pointed this out today. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=105.56s)]
*  Harris and Walz make an interesting duo for all the wrong reasons. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=112.84s)]
*  To her credit, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do make an interesting team because if we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  remember the rioting in the summer of 2020, Tim Walz was the guy who let rioters burn [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=119.08s)]
*  down Minneapolis and then Kamala Harris was the one who bailed the rioters out of jail. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  So there's an interesting team in that sense. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Great point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=132.88s)]
*  On the first night of the violent riots, Tim Walz, he did nothing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=133.96s)]
*  On the second night of the riots, the violent riots, what did he do? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=141.64s)]
*  On the third night, after a target was ransacked, a police precinct was burned to the ground, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=142.64s)]
*  Tim Walz did nothing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  The left-wing mayor of Minneapolis was begging Governor Walz to send in the National Guard. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=151.56s)]
*  Walz refused. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=157.0s)]
*  It wasn't until night five that the governor finally decided to send in the guard and restore [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  order, but by then it was too late. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=163.08s)]
*  Entire neighborhoods were burned to the ground. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=166.12s)]
*  Blocks and blocks of businesses were totally looted. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=168.52s)]
*  Three Americans were dead. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=171.8s)]
*  Governor Walz didn't care. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  He said that the people of Minnesota deserve this violence because of their lack of equity [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  and inclusion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=181.68s)]
*  Can't make it up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=182.68s)]
*  You really can't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=184.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=185.24s)]
*  Large peaceful protests focusing on the systemic changes that get to the heart of why we're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=187.24s)]
*  in this situation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=194.16s)]
*  And when I say we, Minneapolis-St. Paul, the state of Minnesota, nationally and as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=195.16s)]
*  we've seen over the last 24 hours, internationally. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=200.88s)]
*  A society that does not put equity and inclusion at the center of it is certainly going to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  eventually come to the places where we're at. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=209.12s)]
*  Oh, and it gets much worse from here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=212.12s)]
*  The First Lady of Minnesota, Gwen Walz, well, she basked in the riots, telling local media [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=215.16s)]
*  that she actually opened the windows in her home. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=220.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=223.76s)]
*  To smell the burning tires so that she could breathe in the historic moment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=224.76s)]
*  She went on to express her deep admiration for violent criminals, saying that they deserve [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=229.8s)]
*  unlimited chances to commit more crimes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=234.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=237.12s)]
*  I think it takes a lot of imagination and courage to move away from a system that punishes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=238.56s)]
*  people and sets people up for failure to a system that is restorative, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=245.0s)]
*  That is equitable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=255.84s)]
*  That is healing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=258.2s)]
*  How many chances do you get? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=262.0s)]
*  My answer to that is as many chances as you need, which doesn't really please those [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=268.52s)]
*  law and order people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=279.84s)]
*  Vandalism, looting, pelting cops with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, burning [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  down police precincts, ransacking businesses, many chances as you want. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=288.7s)]
*  Apparently, Kamala Harris agrees, which is why she long promoted that Minnesota bail [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=294.92s)]
*  fund, which raised $40-plus million that helped even the most violent criminals get out of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=298.32s)]
*  jail and live among the population and commit more heinous crimes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=303.36s)]
*  Governor Walz even appointed employees from that very same bail fund to the state's, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=307.76s)]
*  get this, sentencing commission. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  And we are just beginning. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Both Walz and Harris also called for funds to be directed away from the police. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  In other words, defund, dismantle, reimagine the police. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=322.88s)]
*  All of this at a time when unrest was wreaking havoc in America's major cities, at the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=326.44s)]
*  time where 574 riots took place. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=331.56s)]
*  Where's Liz Cheney when you need her? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=334.6s)]
*  Where you had dozens of dead Americans, you had billions in property damage, thousands [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=336.72s)]
*  of injured cops, bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=341.88s)]
*  Mostly peaceful? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=346.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=347.32s)]
*  Anyway, Walz actually set up a state hotline encouraging the people of Minnesota to snitch [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=348.56s)]
*  on their neighbors if they weren't following his insane, and they were insane, COVID restrictions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  Walz was a big fan of mandates and huge lockdowns. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=360.28s)]
*  He has absolutely no regrets about preventing kids from going to class or wrecking small [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=363.56s)]
*  businesses. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=368.24s)]
*  And, of course, rioters were not even required to follow his lockdown orders and COVID mandates. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=369.24s)]
*  You could riot away. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  It's mostly peaceful as the city burns. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  By the way, crime is now spiking in Minnesota. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=377.92s)]
*  Look at that, above the national average, for the first time in modern American history. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=380.28s)]
*  So together, you have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=386.28s)]
*  They have turned Minnesota into a hellhole in the name of equity and COVID safety. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=389.32s)]
*  And by the way, Governor Walz also led the effort to change the Minnesota state flag. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=394.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=399.2s)]
*  Because he thought the old flag, using the official state seal, was racist. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=400.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=404.6s)]
*  All right, ready. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=405.6s)]
*  Whoa, wait a minute. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=406.6s)]
*  There, that's better. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=407.6s)]
*  Now if Tim Walz is so offended by his own state's flag, chances are that he probably [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=427.16s)]
*  thinks most of our national monument are racist, and he even commiserated with the rioters. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  Remember, they toppled the Christopher Columbus statute and did nothing to stop their vandalism? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=437.12s)]
*  God help the Jefferson Memorial or Washington Monument if this guy ever gets elected. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, of course, there is one thing that doesn't offend Tim Walz, illegal immigration, because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=447.68s)]
*  he believes and he thinks unlimited illegal immigration is wonderful for our country. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=453.56s)]
*  No vetting, come one, come all. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=459.08s)]
*  No borders, no walls, no vetting whatsoever. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=460.92s)]
*  In fact, Walz mocked border security. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=463.72s)]
*  He even told fake news, CNN, he wanted to invest in a ladder factory to help thwart [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=466.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's border wall. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=471.76s)]
*  Wow, brilliant idea. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=473.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=475.2s)]
*  He's not going to do anything. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=476.2s)]
*  You know, he talks about this wall. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=477.52s)]
*  I always say, let me know how high it is. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=479.4s)]
*  If it's 25 feet, then I'll invest in the 30-foot ladder factory. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  That's not how you stop this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=483.96s)]
*  Yeah, let's give a ladder to people with terror ties, the drug cartels and criminals, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, unvetted into the country. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=491.84s)]
*  Those people that are not coming here for good reasons. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=494.18s)]
*  Walz has also worked to provide a comfortable life for illegal immigrants with your money. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=497.22s)]
*  He signed off on a bill granting taxpayer-funded tuition for illegal immigrants. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=501.94s)]
*  He expanded access to the state's public health care system to cover illegal aliens. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=506.62s)]
*  I know Kamala doesn't like that word. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=511.98s)]
*  And he signed a bill granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants or aliens. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=514.46s)]
*  Needless to say, Walz doesn't want anyone deported. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=520.02s)]
*  He's also a big believer in sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=523.22s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=527.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=528.14s)]
*  Minnesota be a sanctuary state? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=529.14s)]
*  If the definition of that is that the federal government enforces immigration law and local [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=531.46s)]
*  law enforcement enforces local law, then yes. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=536.74s)]
*  Should cities be allowed to be sanctuary cities? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=539.74s)]
*  Yes, local control. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=541.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=543.74s)]
*  Tim Walz is pro-illegal immigration. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=545.34s)]
*  He's pro-criminal. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  He's pro-riot. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  He's pro-looting. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  He's pro-abortion up to the last minute. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=551.6199999999999s)]
*  But the radical position, they don't stop there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=553.8599999999999s)]
*  Just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz also supports universal health care. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  Just like Kamala, well, guess what? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=561.18s)]
*  He also loves to raise taxes, hiking them multiple times as governor. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=563.52s)]
*  And just like Kamala, well, weird Tim Walz also supports abortion up to the very moment [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=567.42s)]
*  of birth. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=572.5799999999999s)]
*  Like Kamala, he also wants to phase out fossil fuels, is against fracking, signed a mandate [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  that requires his state to stop using oil and gas in the next few years. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=579.54s)]
*  He also attacked rural areas in America, as mostly rocks and cows, and it gets worse. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=584.34s)]
*  Flanked by young children, get this, Walz signed a bill guaranteeing life-altering transgender [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=590.82s)]
*  medical procedures for children, like gender reassignment surgery, to any minor in Minnesota, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=597.12s)]
*  regardless of parental consent. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=605.1s)]
*  In his state, parents, you have no rights. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=608.0999999999999s)]
*  In fact, legal experts believe the bill also enables the state of Minnesota to take custody [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=610.8599999999999s)]
*  of a child who has denied so-called gender-affirming care. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=616.78s)]
*  Now, Walz has developed a new nickname on X. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=621.5799999999999s)]
*  They are calling him tonight, Tampon Tim. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=625.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=630.38s)]
*  Now, sounds to me like that might be the kind of name that catches on, that maybe begins [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=631.7s)]
*  to go viral. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=638.34s)]
*  I've seen a lot of tweets about it, a lot of ex-posts about it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=639.34s)]
*  Anyway, after—why did this happen? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=643.46s)]
*  After forcing state schools and other public bathrooms to stock tampons and other menstrual [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=646.16s)]
*  products in boys' bathrooms. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=653.52s)]
*  Ultimately, like Kamala Harris, Walz has supported every far-left position known to man. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=656.98s)]
*  They both seem to use AOC and Congresswoman Omar and other members of the squad as their [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=662.5s)]
*  guiding light. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=667.34s)]
*  He's even praised Omar in spite of well-documented anti-Semitism. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=668.34s)]
*  Walz has nothing but kind words for socialism. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=673.62s)]
*  Once compared it to simply just being nice and neighborly, taking your money and giving [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=676.5s)]
*  it to other people, and they're in power the whole time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=681.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=685.06s)]
*  We can get out there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=686.28s)]
*  Reach out. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=687.52s)]
*  Make the case. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=688.52s)]
*  And for one thing, don't ever shy away from our progressive values. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=689.52s)]
*  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=693.16s)]
*  Just do the damn work. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=696.0799999999999s)]
*  White dudes for Harris, OK? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=698.28s)]
*  You see, Tim Walz is your friendly neighborhood radical socialist coming to Washington to [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=701.64s)]
*  remake America, unless you stop him. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=706.92s)]
*  Unburdened, by the way, by what has been. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=710.12s)]
*  In fact, allow me to pause for a moment to read a glowing endorsement from the Democratic [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  Socialists of America. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  Quote, Harris choosing Walz as a running mate has shown the world that the DSA and our allies [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  on the left are a force that cannot be ignored. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=726.96s)]
*  Oh, no, they're not ignored. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=730.32s)]
*  They're embraced. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=731.84s)]
*  When America's openly devout socialists are elated, it's probably not a good sign. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=733.0s)]
*  But according to Nancy Pelosi, Walz isn't on the left one bit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=738.92s)]
*  A child trans advocate who supports sanctuary cities, defunding the police, praising socialism, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=743.76s)]
*  according to Nancy, is right down the middle. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=750.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=752.7199999999999s)]
*  Tim Walz, I know very well, he served in the House. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  To characterize him as left is so unreal. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=758.52s)]
*  It's just not what the question. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  He's right down the middle. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=765.36s)]
*  He's a heartland of America Democrat. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=766.68s)]
*  That's it, really? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=769.88s)]
*  I was supposed to believe that? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=771.92s)]
*  Even liberal Joe, to his credit, he was having a hard time buying that lie. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=774.3599999999999s)]
*  She's delusional. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=778.64s)]
*  Again, Tim Walz is the Bernie Sanders of American governors. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=779.8s)]
*  In fact, he might actually be further to the left of Bernie, like Kamala Harris is further [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  to the left of Bernie. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  And like Bernie, Walz's honeymoon in a communist country. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=790.76s)]
*  Can't make that up either. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=794.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=795.0s)]
*  Walz and Gwen Walz decided to spend their honeymoon in the People's Republic of China. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=796.32s)]
*  Oh, that's my first choice. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=802.28s)]
*  Now, before their honeymoon in the communist wasteland, Walz and his wife spent a significant [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=804.24s)]
*  amount of time as teachers in China. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=809.6s)]
*  Walz told the local paper, quote, Going there was one of the best things I've ever done. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=812.68s)]
*  Maybe he wants to go back and stay permanently. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=817.88s)]
*  And while Walz loved his time in China, he wasn't so keen on deploying to Iraq as a [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=820.56s)]
*  member of the National Guard. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=825.18s)]
*  Now, according to a report in The New York Post, veterans accused Walz, a number of them, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=826.74s)]
*  of embellishing his entire military career. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=831.54s)]
*  And then, when the moment of truth came, abandoning his battalion after he, quote, slithered out [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=834.5s)]
*  the door before his Iraq deployment. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=839.8199999999999s)]
*  In other words, after he was told that, you're going to Iraq. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=842.58s)]
*  Worse, Walz went on to disparage members of the National Guard in public. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=846.58s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=851.54s)]
*  I don't think the mayor knew what he was asking for. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=852.54s)]
*  He wanted the National Guard. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=854.66s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=855.66s)]
*  I think to the mayor, yes, I think it's a perception. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=856.66s)]
*  I'm certainly not questioning that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=859.02s)]
*  I think the mayor said, I request the National Guard. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=860.34s)]
*  Whew, I'm out. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=862.14s)]
*  This is great. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=863.14s)]
*  We're going to have massively trained troops. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=864.14s)]
*  No, you're going to have 19-year-olds who are cooks in some cases. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=865.14s)]
*  And what are we going to do and how are we going to use them? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=868.38s)]
*  Nineteen-year-olds that are cooks. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=871.86s)]
*  Anyway, another scandal now haunting Walz. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=873.5s)]
*  Oh, he was arrested for DUI in 1995. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=876.78s)]
*  Walz was pulled over after going nearly 100 miles an hour in a 55-mile-per-hour zone, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=880.98s)]
*  reportedly reeked of alcohol, somehow was able to plead down to a reckless driving charge [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=886.74s)]
*  and move on with his life. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, let's be clear. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=894.42s)]
*  Woke, entitled, far left Tim Walz represents everything that is wrong with today's modern, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=896.06s)]
*  radical, extreme, dangerous Democratic Party. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=902.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly why he was picked over somebody like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=907.42s)]
*  Now, take a look at this clip from even CNN's Van Jones in a very honest moment. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=912.46s)]
*  Listen to this closely. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=917.66s)]
*  But you also have anti-Semitism that has gotten marbled into this party. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=919.26s)]
*  You can be for the Palestinians without being an anti-Jewish bigot, but there are some anti-Jewish [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=924.34s)]
*  bigots out there. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQkSvCjvCYk&t=929.38s)]
