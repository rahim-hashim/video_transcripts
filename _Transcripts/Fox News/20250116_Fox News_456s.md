# Speaker Johnson: A new 'golden age' starts in 5 days
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA)
*  I'm here now with Moore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the speaker of the House himself. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=1.48s)]
*  Mike Johnson is with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=3.48s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=5.4s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I look forward to seeing you next week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=8.52s)]
*  Let's start with Joe's farewell. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=10.68s)]
*  And the fundamental question, can Americans look themselves in the eye and can they—and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=14.88s)]
*  ask the question, are they better off economically? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=20.44s)]
*  Are they—is the economy better off? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=23.16s)]
*  Are they more safe and secure, both at home and abroad? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=25.48s)]
*  That would be the measure of any president's success, wouldn't it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=28.52s)]
*  It would. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=33.0s)]
*  And the American people just answered that question in the election cycle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=33.68s)]
*  That's why Donald J. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=36.52s)]
*  Trump led the Republican Party to a landslide victory in the electoral college with the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=37.44s)]
*  popular vote, with the House and the Senate. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=41.72s)]
*  We delivered, in part because President Trump is so strong and President Biden is so weak. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=44.24s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what he said tonight, Sean, the American people know his legacy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=49.64s)]
*  You summarized it really well tonight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  The wide-open border and the catastrophe that that will be for years to come, the skyrocketing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=55.36s)]
*  cost of living, the average American family spending $13,000 more annually just to stay [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=60.08s)]
*  afloat, weakness on the world stage, a terrible, catastrophic foreign policy in every metric. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=65.2s)]
*  We had the weaponization of the DOJ, lawfare, the undermining of our entire system, and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=72.4s)]
*  then the cover-up of his cognitive decline. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=77.44s)]
*  I mean, this is—these are objective facts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=79.8s)]
*  The American people saw that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=82.4s)]
*  They evaluated it, and that's why we have the ushering in of a new golden age that starts [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  in five days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=88.72s)]
*  Look, in the House, you have a very slim majority, and it will get a little larger in the months [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=89.72s)]
*  ahead, but to start out, you have a pretty slim majority. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  The way I look at it is Republicans are going to have to be united. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=100.0s)]
*  Not any one Republican, in my view, is going to get everything that they want. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  And there's going to have to be some give and take. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=110.92s)]
*  You feel confident that the agenda of Donald Trump is the agenda of House Republicans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  Will they unite behind that agenda? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=120.2s)]
*  Because, you know, I would say to people, you know, as Reagan famously said, if you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  80 percent in agreement, you're not my enemy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=131.72s)]
*  He said, I'd rather get 80 percent of what I want than go over the cliff of the flag-waving. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=132.72s)]
*  Let me tell you, I've got great news to report tonight, Sean. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=136.36s)]
*  The House Republican Conference and the Senate Republicans are united. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  This is the America First agenda that we are going to deliver in spades. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=142.66s)]
*  The American people demand and deserve that, and we are ready to act. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  We've been preparing for this moment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=149.78s)]
*  We can't wait for President Trump to take that oath in five days. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=151.38s)]
*  And when he comes into the Oval Office, he will hit the ground running. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll have legislation prepared for him to sign into law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=158.54s)]
*  He'll issue a flurry of executive orders, because we have to fix all these disastrous [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=161.78s)]
*  policies that Biden and Harris delivered to the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=165.82s)]
*  And it will happen quickly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=168.6s)]
*  It's going to be a very aggressive first hundred days agenda. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=169.6s)]
*  We use the budget reconciliation process. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=172.42s)]
*  As we've said so many times, Sean, we have to fix everything. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  So it's going to require teamwork. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  It's going to require unity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=179.78s)]
*  But I'm telling you, every single member in the House and Senate that is a Republican [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=180.77999999999997s)]
*  is ready to get this job done. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=184.32s)]
*  OK, so there's been a back and forth a little bit with the Senate, and we'll talk to Ted [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=186.06s)]
*  Cruz a little later in the program today about whether there is the one big, beautiful bill [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  that takes place or whether you will need to do it in two parts, two separate bills. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=195.82s)]
*  Why do you stand in the House on that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  Because you will go first. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  You will send your bill over to the U.S. Senate, and they will deal with the bill that you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=204.54s)]
*  send them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Ted Cruz is one of my dear friends, and we agree on almost everything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  I think we may have a difference of opinion on the one versus two bill strategy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  But I'll tell you what we're focusing on in the House is achieving the objectives, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=218.78s)]
*  accomplishing the mission. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=222.98s)]
*  And to do that, the one big, beautiful bill strategy makes the most sense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=223.98s)]
*  Remember that the Senate has 53 Republicans in the House. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=228.54s)]
*  I've got 220. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=231.34s)]
*  I'll have a few less when those leave to join the administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=232.34s)]
*  So it's a very complicated set of factors that we have to deal with. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=236.5s)]
*  We have a very diverse conference, much more diverse than the Senate Republicans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  And so I think at the end of the day and hope that they will heed our call for the one bill [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  strategy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=248.34s)]
*  President Trump still prefers that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=249.34s)]
*  He and I talked about it today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=250.66s)]
*  He wants to get all this done in one big, sweeping bill. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=252.3s)]
*  And I think that's the best way to deliver it and get it over the line, Sean. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=254.82s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=258.5s)]
*  Among the many things you have to do is you have to support, secure the border. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  Then we have to find the known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  They have to be deported. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=269.7s)]
*  Others that didn't respect our laws, border sovereignty, they have to be deported. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=271.3s)]
*  Then you have to fix the economy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=275.3s)]
*  I think the key to that is going to be energy dominance. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=276.53999999999996s)]
*  That will make the country rich. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  That could shore up Social Security and Medicare, hopefully start to pay down the debt that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=280.74s)]
*  we're putting on our kids and grandkids and really make America an energy wealthy [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=285.46s)]
*  country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=291.02s)]
*  Can all of that happen? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=292.02s)]
*  Can it happen no later than Memorial Day? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=293.02s)]
*  What is the timeline you're looking at? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=295.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's the timeline. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=297.38s)]
*  All of those things can be accomplished in the budget reconciliation process and many [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=299.82s)]
*  more things. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  Cutting down the size and scope of government, getting control of the regulatory state, limiting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  the bureaucracy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=308.26s)]
*  All these things can happen concurrently because we've been doing all the work to build up [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  for this moment. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=312.9s)]
*  The timeline is, Sean, that we will pass the budget. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  Our target is by late February. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=316.86s)]
*  That sets up the reconciliation process, as you know, and then we get to the real grind [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=319.68s)]
*  of those policy changes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=323.92s)]
*  And we'll do that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=325.22s)]
*  The target is to have this bill on the floor, the one big, beautiful bill, to pass by early [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=326.38000000000005s)]
*  April before Easter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=330.68s)]
*  That would send it over to the Senate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  And if we follow this timetable, it's aggressive, but it's necessary to get relief to the people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  You can have this bill signed into law by the end of April, certainly before Memorial [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  Day. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  That will be a great day for the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=342.86s)]
*  In between that time, though, Sean, remember, a lot will be happening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=344.32s)]
*  The House will be passing all sorts of legislation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  The Senate will go along with so much of this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=350.96s)]
*  And President Trump, of course, will have his executive authority and all the things [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  he's going to do, beginning on day one, to secure that border and begin this economic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  renaissance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=360.38s)]
*  And we can't wait for that to happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=361.38s)]
*  Although it also has to also include refunding the police, restoring law and order, and also [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=362.38s)]
*  what I call preparing for the next generation of warfare. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=369.54s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=372.06s)]
*  I think future wars are not going to be fought on a battlefield but in air-conditioned offices. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=374.06s)]
*  And I believe that President Trump's idea for an Iron Dome is a—it's an idea whose [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=380.14s)]
*  time has come. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=386.18s)]
*  And it may end up being his greatest legacy, you know, a generation from now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=387.66s)]
*  Yeah, it could. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=391.74s)]
*  You know, we've maintained peace through strength. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=393.62s)]
*  And President Trump has exhibited that on the world stage, illustrated that with this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=395.62s)]
*  peace deal with Hamas and Israel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=400.26s)]
*  It would not have happened, as you said, without him having that firm hand. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=402.06s)]
*  Make no mistake, the Biden administration has made a mess of this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=406.22s)]
*  They appeased Iran. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  They failed to confront them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=410.62s)]
*  And that emboldened them and their proxies, like Hamas, while they undermined Israel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=412.3s)]
*  Hamas thought that the Israel-U.S. relationship was weakening. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=417.62s)]
*  President Trump set that record straight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=421.46s)]
*  And that's what's going to happen, restoring peace through strength. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=423.22s)]
*  The future of warfare is different, Sean. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=425.22s)]
*  We have to think about it differently and fund it differently. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be drone warfare, cyber warfare, all those things involved. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=428.86s)]
*  But we have to maintain the greatest fighting force on the planet. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  We will. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=436.88000000000005s)]
*  We're the last great superpower, and America's coming back. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=437.88000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srAXdSYOqSA&t=440.5s)]
