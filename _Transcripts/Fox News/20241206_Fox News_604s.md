# ‘DISGRACE’: DA Bragg slammed for making Daniel Penny case about race
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis)
*  After news broke that the manslaughter charge was dismissed, legal expert Jonathan Turley [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=0.0s)]
*  posted on X that this is what D.A. Alvin Bragg actually wanted all along in setting up a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=5.5s)]
*  possible compromise verdict. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=11.94s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that and everything else. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=13.94s)]
*  Joining us now with more, Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz and Fox News legal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=16.46s)]
*  analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=21.46s)]
*  Gentlemen, thanks for joining me again tonight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=22.94s)]
*  Important issues here we're facing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=25.98s)]
*  Greg, I want to start with you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  At first, I think at first blush that this dismissal of the manslaughter charge seems [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=29.64s)]
*  like good news. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=35.52s)]
*  But to the point that this is what Bragg perhaps wanted is what's interesting to me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=37.2s)]
*  Can you explain that to the viewer? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=43.36s)]
*  Well, it is a partial victory for the defense that prosecutors threw in the towel on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  top charge that they should never have brought. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=52.28s)]
*  And then the judge dismissed it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=55.18s)]
*  But in doing so, Judge Wiley, I think, created what looks like reversible error so that if [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=57.26s)]
*  the jury convicts on the lesser charge next week, it would be overturned on appeal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=69.89999999999999s)]
*  Because the judge contradicted his own earlier ruling that the jury could only consider the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  second count if they found Penny not guilty of the first count. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=76.9s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  Now, the judge is letting the jury do what he said he couldn't do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  And the defense is right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=87.84s)]
*  This is coercive, sort of forcing the jury to convict by changing the rules after the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=89.2s)]
*  fact. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=94.92s)]
*  It's not just unorthodox. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=95.92s)]
*  It's legally wrong. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=97.64s)]
*  The judge's only option, one option only, was to declare a mistrial on a deadlock jury [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=98.84s)]
*  and dismiss one charge during deliberations and then double down on the remaining charge. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=111.0s)]
*  To me, it clearly violates Penny's due process rights. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=112.1s)]
*  But I agree with Turley. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=115.86s)]
*  You know, the lesser included was there as a potential compromise, and maybe that was [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=117.1s)]
*  their intention all along. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=123.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=125.38s)]
*  You know, this is, for all of us, we believe this should never have gone to trial in the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=126.38s)]
*  first place. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=129.86s)]
*  And Professor Dershowitz, in this kind of a dynamic, when you've got even at one point, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=131.14s)]
*  he told the jury that it would have to be another jury. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=137.06s)]
*  They couldn't come to a decision. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=141.24s)]
*  There would be another trial, and another jury would do their job. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=143.08s)]
*  But there's no guarantee that there would be another trial. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=148.12s)]
*  The DA could decide not to try it again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=151.8s)]
*  It seems, again, like there's a kind of coercion that's aimed at the jury at this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=154.46s)]
*  point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=159.82s)]
*  Well, I think it's manipulation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=160.82s)]
*  It's manipulation by the prosecution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, your commentator that protested was absolutely right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a case about racism. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=169.46s)]
*  It's about the racism by the district attorney. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=171.82s)]
*  It's racism because if the racial composition had been flipped, nobody would have brought [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  this case. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=180.18s)]
*  There'd be no protesters outside protesting about a black man being convicted of murder [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=181.18s)]
*  for choking somebody who was white. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=188.84s)]
*  This is all about race, which is why, although this is an attempt to manipulate the jury [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=192.46s)]
*  into coming to a compromise verdict, I think it will fail. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=196.8s)]
*  I'm going to predict here and now that I think the jury will remain deadlocked on the lower [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=200.32s)]
*  count because, as the judge pointed out from what he's heard and seen on the notes, this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=205.2s)]
*  looks like it's about disagreement between the jurors over two things, justification, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=211.0s)]
*  was he justified in doing this, and causation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=216.16s)]
*  Did he actually cause the death? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=218.76s)]
*  And those issues are the same for the higher count and for the lower count. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=220.56s)]
*  Also, if it's tried again, he can't put him on trial again for the higher count. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  That would be double jeopardy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=229.54s)]
*  And so I think the issue is whether or not the manipulation will work and we'll get enough [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=231.26s)]
*  jurors to say, well, you know, no, he didn't commit manslaughter, but negligence, well, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=237.14s)]
*  let's give the prosecution a victory. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  Remember too, the prosecution is running for reelection, and he can't win reelection if [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  he loses this case and also loses the Trump case, which he will on appeal if Trump is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=250.56s)]
*  allowed to appeal. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  Look, Bragg is the worst district attorney in modern New York history. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  That's an office that has had such great people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=261.36s)]
*  Thomas Dewey was the district attorney. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=264.48s)]
*  Morgenthau was the district attorney. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Hogan was the district attorney. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=270.4s)]
*  These are great DAs and now we have Bragg? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=272.2s)]
*  My God. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=275.24s)]
*  He is lowering the office to the lowest possible level and diminishing the respect that all [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=276.38s)]
*  New Yorkers have for what was once a great office located in the Hogan building, and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=282.26s)]
*  it will never be called the Bragg building. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=287.82s)]
*  I guarantee you that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=289.66s)]
*  You know, it's a great office. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=290.66s)]
*  It is a great city, all of which deserve better. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=293.02s)]
*  And Greg, I'll ask you the same thing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=296.74s)]
*  What do you think this jury is going to do? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=299.18s)]
*  I mean, a man's liberty is at stake. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=300.9s)]
*  And if you're going to, you know, kind of do piecemeal things to placate the prosecution [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  or you feel pressured by a judge, how is that justice at all for when somebody's liberty [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  is at stake? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's not justice at all. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  As I said, the case should never have been brought. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  The top counts, certainly not. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=322.44s)]
*  And the fact that the deadlocked jury is still there, and I think they'll still be deadlocked [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=323.96s)]
*  on Monday, a reflection of the liberal views in New York and the public pressure that social [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=329.5s)]
*  activists have applied resulted in this case. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=336.58s)]
*  They care less about law and order and more about identity politics. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=340.26s)]
*  If Neely was white, Penny black, this case wouldn't have been brought. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=343.98s)]
*  But racial justice warriors tried to make it into another. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  George Floyd outrage. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=351.5s)]
*  You played the clip of the Black Lives Matter person. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=353.08s)]
*  You know, they vilified Penny as a racist vigilante, Alvin Bragg all too happy to go [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=356.64s)]
*  along and do their bidding. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=362.08s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, of course. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=363.08s)]
*  And his lead prosecutor implied at every turn that Penny was racist. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=364.08s)]
*  We've got to ask. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=367.08s)]
*  So, but, Greg— [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=368.08s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=369.08s)]
*  Greg, it is— [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=370.08s)]
*  But I think— [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=371.08s)]
*  Go ahead, Professor. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=372.08s)]
*  Well, I think this case was hung before they heard any evidence. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=373.08s)]
*  I think as soon as the jury was selected, this became a hung jury, that some members [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=377.64s)]
*  of the jury said, we don't care about the evidence. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=383.62s)]
*  If a black man is killed by a white man, there's guilt. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=386.38s)]
*  And you're not going to shake that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=390.98s)]
*  No amount of reading back of transcripts, no amount of evidence, no amount of instructions [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=392.38s)]
*  is going to shake that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=398.1s)]
*  So I think that the people who have voted for a hung jury, basically on the top count, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=399.1s)]
*  they're going to stick with it on the lower count. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=405.06s)]
*  I don't think you're going to move people by the law or the facts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  We're going to move them only by the emotions of race. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=411.56s)]
*  And that's what brag has been playing into. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=414.68s)]
*  And it's a disgrace. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=417.32s)]
*  But see, then, Greg, that is—that's, I think, exactly the point, is that the things [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=418.32s)]
*  that made this indeterminable for the manslaughter charge is exactly the same as Professor Dershowitz [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=422.36s)]
*  noted for this other charge. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=429.8s)]
*  So there's—unless, again, unless somebody makes a decision because they've been bullied [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=432.36s)]
*  or pressured, but I think in this kind of a trial, I think that's less likely in this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=438.64s)]
*  kind of a case. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=444.34s)]
*  So what do you think they're going to do? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=445.34s)]
*  Can you read the tea leaves here for a minute? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=447.7s)]
*  Yeah, if you look at the questions they asked over and over and over of the judge, please [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=450.62s)]
*  explain to us the law on justification. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=456.52s)]
*  Well, the doctrine of justifiable homicide applies to both the top count now dismissed [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=459.62s)]
*  and the lower count, which still exists. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=466.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=468.48s)]
*  So those same people that had concerns about justification still harbor those concerns. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=469.48s)]
*  And they're the type of concerns that are deeply embedded in them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=476.48s)]
*  And so I doubt that they're going to change. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=481.66s)]
*  I think, Professor, Dershowitz is right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  There's still going to be a hung jury on Monday, but we'll have to wait and see. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=486.32000000000005s)]
*  We will. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=491.16s)]
*  And, you know, this is perhaps— [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=492.16s)]
*  But you know, there's one possibility— [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=493.16s)]
*  What scenario? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=494.22s)]
*  The best case scenario— [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=495.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's one possibility that— [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=496.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=497.22s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=498.22s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=499.22s)]
*  There's one possibility of the case being unhung, and that is fear, fear on the part [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=500.22s)]
*  of some of the jurors who would vote for a quit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  You have these people standing outside shouting racial epithets. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  One of them was shouting homophobic epithets at the defendant in the case. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=514.1s)]
*  Nobody knows what his sexual orientation is. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=519.1s)]
*  Nobody should care. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=521.2s)]
*  But these are rioters. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=522.38s)]
*  These are Black Lives Matter rioters. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=524.5400000000001s)]
*  These are people who don't care about justice. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=527.46s)]
*  They only care about justice for them and their race. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=530.4200000000001s)]
*  And this is racial injustice. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=535.5s)]
*  This is so scary for America. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=537.5s)]
*  And I hope the judge will have the good sense to understand that you can't allow that kind [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=541.22s)]
*  of racism to enter into the courtroom. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=548.58s)]
*  He allowed one of the Black Lives Matter people to come into the courtroom and sit [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=551.1s)]
*  next to the family of the victim after he had made these racial and homophobic statements. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=554.28s)]
*  So we have to be very concerned, because what is today unfair to one group of people can [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=561.36s)]
*  easily be as unfair to another group of people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=567.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=569.76s)]
*  We do have to go, but I'll tell you, this is a dynamic where we've seen too often, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=570.76s)]
*  of course, with the Jewish community here in New York and around the country, this jury [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=574.96s)]
*  refusing to participate with another deadlock would be obviously the best news we could [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=579.82s)]
*  have at this point. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=586.82s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, Greg Jarrett, great job. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=588.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH23M09zZis&t=590.74s)]
