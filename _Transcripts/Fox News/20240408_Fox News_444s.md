# Newt Gingrich: Biden is violating the law every day
**Fox News:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8)
*  Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, let's get your overall take on this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=4.4s)]
*  I think you would agree they can't run on their record. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=8.52s)]
*  You can't run on your record. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=11.44s)]
*  You got to lie, smear, besmirch, slander even, and then weaponize your Justice Department [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=12.6s)]
*  and throw 91 charges against your opponent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=18.44s)]
*  I guess that's all you got, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=21.68s)]
*  Well, and—but also, as you point out, they're in a position to simply try to buy votes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=23.68s)]
*  Most of the Green Initiative is buying votes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  This whole student loan thing is buying votes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  The effort they put into rewarding the teachers' union is buying votes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=38.84s)]
*  When you come down to it, the Democratic Party is a combination of a very, very left-wing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=43.68s)]
*  and a machine that has to have your money to survive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=50.4s)]
*  So, I think what they're hoping is that they can get away with breaking the law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=54.6s)]
*  You made a point here that really has to be, I think, focused on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=59.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court said that what Joe Biden is doing on student loans is unconstitutional. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=63.28s)]
*  Now, he's the first president I know of who simply ignores the Supreme Court. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=70.8s)]
*  He wants to give away more of your money. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care what the court says. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=77.64s)]
*  In fact, he boasts he doesn't care what the court says. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=79.28s)]
*  So you have a routine lawbreaking. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=82.48s)]
*  And my fear, Sean, is when you get to September and October and none of this is working, you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=84.56s)]
*  can't imagine what they'll do, because they have no limits. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=90.2s)]
*  They don't believe in the rule of law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=94.2s)]
*  They believe in the rule of power. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=95.84s)]
*  They're proving every day that they think they can get away with things that are crazy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=97.28s)]
*  and that they don't care what the country thinks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=102.04s)]
*  They still have most of the left-wing propaganda media covering for them and protecting them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=105.32s)]
*  It's amazing how many things they get away with, because nobody at the New York Times [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=111.0s)]
*  or the Washington Post or the three major networks, none of them will go out and take [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=117.2s)]
*  them on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=122.0s)]
*  None of them will tell the truth. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=123.0s)]
*  So people now know that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=124.56s)]
*  People know we have way too many illegal immigrants. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=127.72s)]
*  People know we have too much crime. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=130.92s)]
*  People know that when they go to the grocery store, they're not able to buy what they [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=133.32s)]
*  used to. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=136.72s)]
*  And if the price is the same, the size is smaller. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=137.96s)]
*  If the size is the same, the price is higher. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think all these things mean that the average American is going to condemn the Biden [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=145.36s)]
*  administration as bad for their lives and bad for America. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=151.76s)]
*  And I think it's hard to see, other than just plain breaking the law and finding ways, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=156.44s)]
*  basically, to make Trump in prison. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we just had an election in Senegal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  The winner was a reformer who only got out of jail 10 days before the election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  And I thought there was certain parallel here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  If the Democrats have their way, Donald Trump will spend all of the fall campaign in jail. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  It is despicable. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  It undermines America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=187.56s)]
*  And I think every American should be putting pressure on their House and Senate members [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=189.28s)]
*  of both parties to stand up to this tyrannical president who is violating the law every day. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=193.8s)]
*  And it does it with regularity. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=202.56s)]
*  The entire 10 million-plus illegal immigrants is a case in point about that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=203.96s)]
*  And you're right about using taxpayer money to buy votes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=208.84s)]
*  I mean, that's, you know, clearly—and defying the U.S. Supreme Court and not enforcing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=211.68s)]
*  and picking and choosing which laws you will enforce and which you choose not to. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=217.36s)]
*  We know their playbook, though. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=222.16s)]
*  January 6, January 6, but they'll forget the main details of things that we've learned. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=223.88s)]
*  Donald Trump did not try to commandeer the vehicle. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=229.28s)]
*  Donald Trump has four witnesses in the days leading up to January 6 that he was willing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=232.12s)]
*  to authorize 10,000 troops. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=237.88s)]
*  And in writing, the D.C. mayor that had to sign off on it, yeah, she said in writing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=240.16s)]
*  she would not. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=244.6s)]
*  You know, the Capitol police chief also was requesting in the days prior national guard [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  troops. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=251.16s)]
*  So they'll demagogue January 6. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=252.16s)]
*  Then they're going to get to the usual playbook, Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  I give the whole list. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=258.88s)]
*  And then we have the issue of abortion, which I believe hurt Republicans in 2022. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=261.0s)]
*  And I believe Doug Mastriano was a case in point. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=267.52s)]
*  And he lost by 16 points. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=271.0s)]
*  He didn't have exceptions for rape incest in the mother's life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=274.12s)]
*  And that hurt every Republican down ticket. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=277.44s)]
*  So my question for you is, as the great historian and strategist that you are, what do you tell [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=280.36s)]
*  Republicans? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=286.6s)]
*  I would argue that they've got to—if they're being lied about on abortion, they better [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=287.6s)]
*  match every Democratic lie with the truth in an ad or however else they are messaging [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=292.48s)]
*  this, or they will risk being positioned by the Democrats. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=298.76s)]
*  What is your advice? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  My advice is to listen to Donald Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump has laid out a perfectly rational strategy, which, by the way, Judge Ginsburg said back [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=309.12s)]
*  in the early 1990s in a speech that she thought Roe v. Wade was wrong because it took the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=317.32000000000005s)]
*  decision on abortion away from the American people and gave it to a group of lawyers. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=323.72s)]
*  So in a funny way, he and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are on the same side. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=329.22s)]
*  Let the American people decide. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=333.86s)]
*  Different states will have different decisions. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=336.82000000000005s)]
*  And I must say, most of the right-to-life leaders understand exactly what President [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump is trying to do. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=344.12s)]
*  He is trying to reach the largest possible number of babies saved. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=345.36s)]
*  He's trying to create the best possible environment in the current culture and in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=349.22s)]
*  And he's doing it in a way which is extraordinarily pro-life without alienating people with the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=354.58s)]
*  kind of fear-mongering the Democrats have. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  I thought what he did, his statement, was exactly right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=363.58s)]
*  And I think people are read it carefully and think about it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=367.5s)]
*  We are a country that has to have this conversation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=370.18s)]
*  I personally, and as you know, Kallissa, is very deeply committed to life. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=373.46s)]
*  I personally would like to have the fewest possible abortions, period. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=379.06s)]
*  We are very pleased to go to the 50th anniversary of a pregnancy group in Florida that has saved [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=383.38s)]
*  23,000 lives during the history of the group. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=389.42s)]
*  I compare that to Kamala Harris going to an abortion clinic where they're killing babies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=393.54s)]
*  I think the contrast can't be deeper, and I think Trump is exactly in the right place. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, on most issues, Trump's understanding intuitively of where the American [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=404.02s)]
*  people are is better than any Republican pollster or professional. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=409.38s)]
*  And I think candidates ought to pay attention, just as I used to do with Ronald Reagan. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=413.86s)]
*  They ought to pay attention to what President Trump is saying, try to figure out why he's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=417.42s)]
*  saying it, and see to what degree they can learn by watching, I think, one of the most [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=421.34s)]
*  extraordinary political leaders of my lifetime. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=425.82s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, always great to have you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=428.54s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJBREBI1o8&t=432.65999999999997s)]
