# James Comer, Jim Jordan claim Hunter Biden's testimony 'CONFIRMED' wrongdoings
**Fox News:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI)
*  Hey, with more on today's deposition, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=0.0s)]
*  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, House Ways and Means Committee Jason Smith. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=4.0s)]
*  He's the chairman there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=8.36s)]
*  All right, James Comer, let's start with you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=9.6s)]
*  Let's get your general impressions of the day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=12.44s)]
*  Well, I thought it was a very good deposition for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=14.36s)]
*  We were able to confirm a lot of the wrongdoings through Hunter Biden's testimony. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=18.48s)]
*  There are many financial crimes that we believe that were committed by the Biden family. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=24.96s)]
*  Hunter was asked about specific transactions with specific LLCs, many of whom that I've [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=31.04s)]
*  referred to as shell companies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  We got his answer on the record. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=38.96s)]
*  We're going to go back and verify many of those things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=41.72s)]
*  But what we also learned today, Sean, was that a lot of what Hunter said was contradictory [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=45.34s)]
*  to what three, at least three of his former associates said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  I think the next phase now is to bring Hunter in for a public hearing and hear from the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=55.0s)]
*  other Biden associates. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=60.88s)]
*  And let's determine then who the American people think are telling the truth, because [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  we've got the bank records. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=67.2s)]
*  Bank records don't lie. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=68.68s)]
*  We know the Bidens have taken in tens of millions of dollars from our adversaries around the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=69.92s)]
*  world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=73.68s)]
*  And we still don't know after all these depositions, after all the hours of testimony from the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=74.68s)]
*  Biden family, exactly what the Biden family did to earn the $30 million from our enemies [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=79.2s)]
*  around the world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think, Jim Jordan, that's that's a key part of the question here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  Now, Hunter on his own laptop, though, is very real, implicates his father. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=90.72s)]
*  Half his income goes to Pops. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  What account should I pay for dad's home repairs? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=96.84s)]
*  10% for the big guy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=99.08s)]
*  Then, of course, we have Devin Archer, not one, but 20 phone calls he testified to that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=100.4s)]
*  Joe called in on with foreign business partners, then meeting Elena Batarina and others at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  the Cafe Milano, the Russian oligarch, foreign business partner. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  That seems to implicate the father in a major way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=115.5s)]
*  And a big part of the testimony from what I read and heard in my sources had to do with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=118.72s)]
*  the fact that he just wanted to protect his dad under all circumstances here in spite [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=123.8s)]
*  of what would be a lot of evidence to the contrary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=128.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=130.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Sean, the rules, the House rules prohibit us in a deposition format from talking [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=132.60000000000002s)]
*  about specifics of that deposition until the transcript is released. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  But as Chairman Comer said, there were lots of things said today that evidence we've already [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=140.8s)]
*  got and witnesses we've already talked to contradict what Hunter Biden said. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=146.0s)]
*  So we but I do think that maybe the best takeaway is we got a lot of good information. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=151.8s)]
*  I think would be a good roadmap for when, in fact, we do have a public hearing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=156.12s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=161.12s)]
*  We already knew that it was phone calls, it was lunches, it was dinners, it was rounds [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=162.12s)]
*  of golf from the same White House who said he had no involvement whatsoever with his [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=166.96s)]
*  business and any of his business associates, but he engaged in all those activities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=171.68s)]
*  And we knew that from previous witnesses that we've had a chance to depose. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=175.52s)]
*  And Jason Smith, he's basically basically saying that all his business partners lied and he's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=180.44s)]
*  the one telling the truth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  But then I go back to what Congressman Comer just said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=187.16s)]
*  When you look at the bank records, when you look at what you've identified, what you've [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=190.44s)]
*  said on this program, and James Comer has said, identifying 10 Biden family members [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=194.52s)]
*  that got paid. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=199.24s)]
*  OK, well, what did they actually do? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=200.68s)]
*  What services were rendered for this massive amount of money of millions and millions of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=203.8s)]
*  dollars? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=209.04s)]
*  Did you ascertain that? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=210.04s)]
*  Did you ascertain what Hunter did, how he was capable of doing it, considering he mentioned [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=211.04s)]
*  many times today his addiction? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=215.98s)]
*  Can you tell us what the grandchildren that got paid, what they did for the money they got? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Sean, Hunter came up with numerous excuses. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  He first started out his opening statement, as you said earlier, that his father was not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=227.0s)]
*  involved in his business dealings. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=233.04s)]
*  His business associates have testified differently. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=234.2s)]
*  The two IRS whistleblowers that came before the Ways and Means Committee, their evidence [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  proves differently. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  In fact, Sean, 327 different emails proved differently. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=243.56s)]
*  That was between Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and his business associates. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=248.68s)]
*  Joe Biden was not just involved, he was a participant in these activities. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=259.48s)]
*  Let me—I beg your indulgence, James Comer, for a second. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=261.32s)]
*  Bear with me, because as Hunter talked about MAGA-motivated conspiracy theories and how [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  he's been hunted in a partisan political pursuit of his dad and that you've been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=270.76s)]
*  dealing in innuendo distortion sensationalism, let me ask you about the case that I think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=274.76s)]
*  most Americans know the most about, and that would be the case of Burisma, the oil and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=279.64s)]
*  gas giant out of Ukraine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=284.24s)]
*  Was John Solomon's reporting correct that in October of 2015, interagency decision came [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=287.6s)]
*  down in the Obama administration that they would—that enough progress had been made [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=294.16s)]
*  regarding corruption in Ukraine that warranted a billion dollars in loan guarantees? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=299.48s)]
*  Is that true in October of 2015? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=304.92s)]
*  I believe that was from an email from the John Kerry State Department, yes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=308.04s)]
*  Okay, next question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=312.32s)]
*  In December of that same year, 2015, have you confirmed and corroborated that a phone [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=313.48s)]
*  call took place with Joe Biden and Hunter when he was in Dubai with Burisma executives [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=318.68s)]
*  five days before Joe went to Ukraine? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=324.12s)]
*  I believe Devin Archer testified that, yes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=328.0s)]
*  Let me ask the next question, because I think this is the key question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, when Joe went there, didn't he brag before the Council on Foreign Relations that, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=334.36s)]
*  in fact, he withheld—he said, you're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=339.48s)]
*  that Burisma was so concerned about when they wanted D.C. help, and that's when he leveraged [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=345.12s)]
*  the billion, and they gave him six hours, and son of a B, that guy got fired. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=350.48s)]
*  As a result of that firing, did Hunter continue to get paid by Burisma Holdings for work that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=355.16s)]
*  he had no background or expertise in at a time where he focused a lot today on, at a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=362.2s)]
*  time that he admits he was addicted to hard drugs? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=368.32s)]
*  Is that all true? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=371.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=372.32s)]
*  That's all true. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=373.32s)]
*  How many shell corporations have you identified, and have you noticed any other legitimate [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=375.26s)]
*  business activity in any of those accounts? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=381.64s)]
*  And, Sean, I haven't found an LLC yet other than his Owasco, which he said was his professional [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  account, which he charged all of the other LLCs legal fees for. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=391.84s)]
*  He was a lawyer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what legal fees he performed, but all—at least 20 of those LLCs don't [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  appear to have any assets. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=404.24s)]
*  They didn't have any website. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  They didn't have an office. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=407.98s)]
*  They didn't produce a good. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=411.74s)]
*  They didn't produce a service. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=413.22s)]
*  They weren't involved in any type of manufacturing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  They weren't licensed to be any type of lobbyist or consultant. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  So it appears that 20 of those LLCs were, in fact, shell companies, a shell company, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=421.82s)]
*  by definition, as a company with no assets or no known purpose. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=427.5s)]
*  Now, some of the companies he tries to claim throughout the course of this investigation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=430.86s)]
*  companies, but we released an email from a bank examiner that looked into one of these [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=436.42s)]
*  so-called investment companies and said, in an email from one bank examiner to another, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=441.26s)]
*  this appears to be an investment company with no investments. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=446.18s)]
*  I think that email pretty much sums up everything that I've been able to learn from all of these [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=449.42s)]
*  different LLCs that the Bidens had. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=457.06s)]
*  Jim Jordan, let me go to the other oil and gas giant, this one out of China. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=461.26s)]
*  Again, Hunter, no experience. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=465.46s)]
*  Hunter claims the WhatsApp message that was written when he was either high or drunk. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=467.66s)]
*  He claims now that, in spite of what he wrote, his father was not there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=472.98s)]
*  First of all, for somebody that was high or drunk, I'd say that was a pretty articulate [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=477.98s)]
*  message that was sent and pretty sophisticated on some levels. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  He sent it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=486.38s)]
*  Is it true or not true that days after that exchange that millions of dollars was sent [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  to one of the Biden family bank accounts? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=492.42s)]
*  Is that true, Jim Jordan? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=495.42s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=498.22s)]
*  That's exactly accurate, Sean. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=499.38s)]
*  OK, and explain what that means. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=502.14s)]
*  In the spring of that year, you had eight Chinese executives show up at the Four Seasons [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=503.98s)]
*  with Hunter Biden and his business partners. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  This is according to testimony from Rob Walker. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=513.0999999999999s)]
*  And while they're at this lunch to close the deal, in comes Joe Biden for a drop-by, a [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=517.42s)]
*  drop-in, and he does a short speech to the group and then leaves. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  And then the deal gets sealed. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  Then the agreement gets finalized. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=527.8599999999999s)]
*  And a few weeks later, Hunter Biden gets $3 million from this Chinese energy company. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=529.3399999999999s)]
*  And then later that summer, the very thing you just talked about with the WhatsApp message [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=534.38s)]
*  is when the $5 million comes into Hunter Biden. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=538.06s)]
*  OK, Jason Smith, in any of these business dealings, where we're talking about tens [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=541.7s)]
*  of millions of dollars, can you—Hunter claimed, I guess, his background on a U.N. board, on [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  an Amtrak board, his background as an attorney. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=552.7s)]
*  But then again, when convenience seems to claim, you know, that he was addicted at the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=555.78s)]
*  time, Jason Smith, is there any services that you've identified that he offered any of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=559.7s)]
*  these companies for the massive amounts of money that they're talking about here? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=565.14s)]
*  The only services that he offered to all of these companies was access to the brand. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=569.3s)]
*  And the brand is Joe Biden, his father. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=576.58s)]
*  They sold access all over the world. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  The Chinese, Ukraine, Romania, you could name the countries, and millions of dollars, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=582.06s)]
*  knowing that this is how you get to his father, is through him. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=587.9s)]
*  Last question. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=591.98s)]
*  I'll ask Congressman Comer and Congressman Jim Jordan. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=594.1s)]
*  A lot of people felt that Hunter got special consideration when you sent a second subpoena. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=597.6600000000001s)]
*  I understand that this deposition was not videotaped today, and you agreed to only three [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=605.22s)]
*  hours of the deposition on the Republican side. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=610.9000000000001s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=614.7800000000001s)]
*  Was that consideration given to Peter Navarro or Steve Bannon, that are both facing jail [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=615.7800000000001s)]
*  terms for contempt of Congress? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=620.34s)]
*  James Comer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=622.26s)]
*  Well, I think that we got a lot of questions in. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=623.26s)]
*  You know, I think the deposition lasted longer than that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=626.7s)]
*  Jim may have a better idea. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=629.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the final count was. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=630.9000000000001s)]
*  But the Democrats didn't use their full hour. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=632.9000000000001s)]
*  The way the depositions work, we get an hour, then they get an hour. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=635.6600000000001s)]
*  We took the full first hour. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=639.26s)]
*  They took about 20 minutes the second hour. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=641.58s)]
*  We took another full hour. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=643.7s)]
*  They didn't take but maybe 15 minutes the second hour. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=645.34s)]
*  And then we went way past the third hour. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=648.5s)]
*  So I feel like we got a lot of questions in. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=651.82s)]
*  But I'll yield to Jim Jordan and let him answer that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=654.5400000000001s)]
*  Jim? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=657.5400000000001s)]
*  No, no, Sean. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think we had a good deposition today. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  As we said before, I think we got a roadmap for if in fact we have a public hearing at [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=661.86s)]
*  some later point. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=665.5400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, we got these contradictory statements from Hunter Biden to all the witnesses [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=666.5400000000001s)]
*  and evidence we've gathered thus far. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=671.02s)]
*  So we're going to continue our impeachment inquiry. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  Next week, we have Sally Painter, who was with this Democrat public relations firm that did [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=674.7s)]
*  work for Burisma. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=678.98s)]
*  And then the week after that, we have a public hearing with Robert Herr on the classified [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=680.22s)]
*  document issue relative to Joe Biden mishandling all those classified documents over several [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=684.6600000000001s)]
*  decades that he did, according to the special counsel's report. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=691.4200000000001s)]
*  Last exit question on a scale of one to ten, how damaging was today's testimony or deposition [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=696.5400000000001s)]
*  to Hunter Biden? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  Jason Smith, you go first. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=703.5400000000001s)]
*  One to ten, ten being the worst. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=704.9s)]
*  Well, I would say that they're pretty good at not recalling many things. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=707.1800000000001s)]
*  So I would say an eight. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=710.7s)]
*  Okay, James Comer. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=712.4200000000001s)]
*  I'd say an eight. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=714.22s)]
*  Okay, Jim Jordan. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=716.5s)]
*  Sean, Sean, I think it was very good for us. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=718.34s)]
*  As I said, I think we got a lot of information that we can use if in fact we have a public [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=721.22s)]
*  hearing as Chairman Comer is talking about. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=724.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zzW7K4aI&t=727.22s)]
