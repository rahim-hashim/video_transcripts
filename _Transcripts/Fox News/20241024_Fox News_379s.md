# Sen. Tim Scott: Democrats are losing their minds because they're losing voters
**Fox News:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE)
*  MSDNC host Alex Wagner spoke to members of the Black Republican Club of Philadelphia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=0.0s)]
*  as well as black men at a barbershop in Philadelphia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=7.92s)]
*  And here's what they had to say about Kamala Harris and Obama's controversial comments [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=11.84s)]
*  about the brothers and, of course, maybe their little sexist. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=17.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=21.28s)]
*  We're voting for Donald Trump unequivocally, period. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=22.28s)]
*  No one else is going to persuade us? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=26.68s)]
*  He's more strong, like, strong-minded in a way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=28.24s)]
*  He's focused on what we got to focus on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=31.0s)]
*  Like, he doesn't play. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  That's what I respect about him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=34.08s)]
*  He doesn't take BS. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=35.4s)]
*  He's not going to hear it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=36.4s)]
*  He's a businessman. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  He's not there for the fluff talk of politics. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=39.44s)]
*  We need someone strong. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=42.0s)]
*  I don't think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=43.12s)]
*  other presidents that are built for this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=49.4s)]
*  Obama made remarks on the campaign trail. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=53.08s)]
*  He was at a stop. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=55.68s)]
*  Pittsburgh. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=56.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=58.12s)]
*  And he said, I think there's some brothers out there who are on the fence, and they're [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=59.12s)]
*  saying it's because of this or that, but I think, I'm paraphrasing here, but it's because [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=62.32s)]
*  they have a problem electing a woman as president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=67.12s)]
*  I was deeply offended, and it felt like a moment where it's like, you, N-words, better [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=70.48s)]
*  get in line and do what we say. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=75.24s)]
*  And the general tone of it was disgusting. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=78.44s)]
*  It was abhorrent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=80.78s)]
*  I don't respect it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=81.78s)]
*  I didn't like nothing about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=82.78s)]
*  And breaking now, new poll. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=85.4s)]
*  Trump is receiving record levels of support for a Republican from African-American men [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  and African—and Latino-American men. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=92.56s)]
*  And breaking tonight, Wall Street Journal poll. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has opened up a three-point lead nationally against Kamala Harris. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=98.64s)]
*  That is a big number. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=104.68s)]
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=105.68s)]
*  Let's respond to the—I guess you'd call it the town hall, if you will, that they had [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=109.76s)]
*  on MSDNC. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=117.48s)]
*  I don't think those were the answers that they were expecting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=118.48s)]
*  Well, Sean, it is a great time to be Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=121.76s)]
*  He is making record gains with African-American young men as well as Hispanic young men. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  Sean, the answer is crystal clear. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  He has a record of success. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=135.5s)]
*  Perhaps one of the greatest presidents in my lifetime for African-American issues, from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=138.0s)]
*  college funding to low unemployment, high enthusiasm, wages growing faster at the bottom [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=142.56s)]
*  than the top. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=148.4s)]
*  But he also focused on things like crime and sickle cell anemia, research helping to accelerate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=149.4s)]
*  the path to cures. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=155.8s)]
*  And at the exact same time, Democrats, Sean, are losing their minds because they're losing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=156.8s)]
*  their voters. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=163.68s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has said there's nothing she would change about the Biden years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=164.92s)]
*  That means that the average family, black or white, losing $1,000 a month in spending [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=169.88s)]
*  power, she wouldn't change that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=176.0s)]
*  Open borders, letting Venezuelan gangs in, as you talked about earlier, that's ravishing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=178.44s)]
*  and devastating black poor communities, she wouldn't change any of that either. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=183.48s)]
*  Crime destroys communities of color, and the poorest Americans feel it first. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=188.56s)]
*  What would she do? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=195.88s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=197.32s)]
*  Of course, black men, Hispanics, like every other man in this country, is looking at Donald [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=198.32s)]
*  Trump as the solution and Kamala Harris as the problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=205.0s)]
*  This is what we call in South Carolina, common sense. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  to be a Republican, but a great time to be Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=214.6s)]
*  You know, if you look at unemployment in the Trump years before the pandemic, record low [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  after record low for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=223.78s)]
*  African American youth unemployment, the growth rate nationally was a whopping 6.8 percent, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=229.76s)]
*  7.9 percent for African Americans, 7.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, 10.6 percent for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=235.76s)]
*  Asian Americans, all record highs in terms of new income levels for all of these groups. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=244.32s)]
*  And as incomes grew, the poverty rate dropped a whopping— [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=251.56s)]
*  Down. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  —to a whopping 60-year low, the largest reduction in poverty in over 50 years, lifting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  people out of poverty. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=264.84s)]
*  If you compare that to the Obama years, they increased the number of people in poverty [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  by almost a million, and this is from the White House Council of Economic Advisers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=271.44s)]
*  Those are real numbers. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=277.0s)]
*  It's remarkable, Sean. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=279.88s)]
*  And here's the other thing that President Trump did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=280.88s)]
*  He signed my Opportunity Zone legislation that has brought $84.7 billion into majority [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=283.08s)]
*  minority communities, not from the federal government but from the private sector. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=290.4s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=294.96s)]
*  Well, the private sector creates jobs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=295.96s)]
*  The government gives handouts. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and all of America, we don't want handouts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=301.32s)]
*  We want a hand up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=306.0s)]
*  So the fact of the matter is that President Trump focused on making sure the average American, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  no matter the color of your skin, had more opportunities, which led to higher enthusiasm [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  and very low inflation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=319.52s)]
*  Listen, African-American unemployment went under 6 percent for the first time, Hispanic [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  unemployment under 5 percent for the first time, Asian under 3 percent. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  We want a president not only that can handle the domestic issues at home, we also want [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=333.12s)]
*  a president who can handle the global stage without falling asleep or without people saying [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=337.94s)]
*  no comment, no confidence. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  When President Trump shows up on the global stage, he demands respect and he gets it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=347.12s)]
*  It's time for the city on the hill to be the rising sun that people keep watching. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=353.76s)]
*  That's America and that's under Donald J. Trump. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=360.0s)]
*  All right, Senator Tim Scott, we appreciate you being with us as always. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12RjXXGnULE&t=363.04s)]
