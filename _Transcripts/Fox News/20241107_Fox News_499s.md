# Dave Portnoy: This probably 'cost' Kamala Harris her campaign
**Fox News:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc)
*  All right, instead of taking any responsibility for their loss, the Democrats' blame game [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=0.0s)]
*  has started as they desperately now try to pin the loss on anything but their own far-left [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=6.3s)]
*  policies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=12.0s)]
*  Last night, after Donald Trump's victory, Dave Portnoy of Barstool's fame, in a video [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=13.0s)]
*  he shared on social media, explained how Democrats gave the American people no choice. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=24.14s)]
*  A lot of people are asking, like, how did Trump get more votes than he got last time? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=25.14s)]
*  Well, here's the answer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=29.0s)]
*  Because people like myself, independents or moderates, the Democrats gave us no choice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=30.48s)]
*  The Democrats gave us no choice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=36.04s)]
*  That was the worst campaign, and their pure arrogance and their moral superiority have [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=37.88s)]
*  driven people away. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=43.76s)]
*  If you say you're voting for Trump, suddenly you're a Nazi, you're Hitler, you're garbage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Enough. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=51.04s)]
*  Enough. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=52.04s)]
*  Tonight is on the Democrats. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=53.04s)]
*  Congratulations, Donald Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=54.92s)]
*  I voted for him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=56.0s)]
*  And I felt I had no choice but to vote for him for the campaign that the Democrats ran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=58.36s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=62.84s)]
*  He's right, Americans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=64.92s)]
*  He's sick and tired of Democrats, their far-left policies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=65.92s)]
*  You know, take a look at Deep Blue, California, Proposition 36, a ballot measure that will [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=68.88s)]
*  roll back some of California's soft on-crime policies, overwhelmingly passing in the state. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=74.12s)]
*  And L.A. County District Attorney George Gascon, one of the most progressive D.A.s in the country, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=80.64s)]
*  lost his re-election bid to an independent Nathan Hockman. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=88.16s)]
*  Here with reaction, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Dave, good to see you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=94.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, apparently we have some audio issues. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=95.52s)]
*  Thanks for being patient with us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=98.12s)]
*  Let's talk about what it was. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=100.88s)]
*  I don't like being called a Nazi. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=102.56s)]
*  I don't like being called a racist. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=104.4s)]
*  I don't like being called a fascist. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm not a piece of garbage, and I don't like people that are racist and fascist and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=108.0s)]
*  Nazis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=112.92s)]
*  That was their closing argument? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=113.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's been nonstop. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=116.68s)]
*  It was the deplorables before that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=118.68s)]
*  So it's a nonstop assault on your senses, and they're insulting, like I said, more than [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=121.0s)]
*  half the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=125.22s)]
*  At some point they're going to learn their lessons, but that was their entire campaign, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=128.44s)]
*  essentially. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=132.28s)]
*  It really was. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=133.28s)]
*  You know, if you can't run on, especially if you've been in office four years, if you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=135.0s)]
*  can't name a single thing that you did that made people's lives better, in my mind, you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=139.28s)]
*  have no campaign, because you had four years to do it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=146.04s)]
*  And then she went the whole campaign not having to answer questions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=149.56s)]
*  That bothered me, too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=152.64s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the craziest things is her campaign was turn the page, you know, start [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=153.64s)]
*  a new America, all this, trying to distance herself from Joe Biden, who obviously they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=159.84s)]
*  basically threw a coup. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=164.32s)]
*  But then when the most obvious questions of all time would be asked, the most predictable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=165.96s)]
*  questions, how are you different than Joe? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  What would you have done differently? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=173.32s)]
*  She couldn't get an answer to that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=175.12s)]
*  That's probably the biggest ring and indictment of the campaign. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=176.44s)]
*  You know that question is coming. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=179.8s)]
*  You know it's on people's mind. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=181.84s)]
*  I don't know how they didn't sit around with the smartest people they got me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=184.16s)]
*  Hey, here's how you answer that question. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=187.44s)]
*  She never was able to, and it probably cost her the campaign. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=189.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=193.44s)]
*  And then, you know, you have this issue of gender affirming care, California, Minnesota, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=194.5s)]
*  without parental consent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=199.32s)]
*  What parents don't have any rights at all? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=201.44s)]
*  Or Tim Walz, you know, wanting to put feminine hygiene products in boys' bathrooms, fourth [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=204.8s)]
*  grade boys' bathrooms. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=211.56s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=214.96s)]
*  I don't get that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=215.96s)]
*  Help me out with that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=217.28s)]
*  No, I mean, those issues, to me personally, and everybody's their own, are less important [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=218.28s)]
*  than some of the major issues like crime, borders. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't do it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=226.16s)]
*  I'm not going to, like, I'm not going to vote based on that issue. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=227.4s)]
*  There's a lot of other more important issues to me, but those are the ones that forced [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  me to go to Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=234.72s)]
*  Yeah, but put it this way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=236.28s)]
*  I know you're not a parent, but—and I was going to get to this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  You certainly know we called him tampon Tim, but, you know, here you are, alpha male, tough [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  guy, you know, all American, as far as I can see. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  And then you've got this soft side. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=254.96s)]
*  And I watch all of your videos of Miss Peaches, and now we have a second dog that you've [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=258.12s)]
*  adopted, the Beagle. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=264.96s)]
*  And— [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=265.96s)]
*  Yeah, Pete the Beagle. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=266.96s)]
*  You know, all of a sudden, you're like the toughest guy in the world, and then it's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=267.96s)]
*  like, when you're around your dog, Miss Peaches, I love you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=271.8s)]
*  And it seems so sincere, and you love this dog, and now you have another dog. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=276.08s)]
*  And how much money did you raise for shelter dogs? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=281.6s)]
*  We've raised a little over a million bucks so far for shelter dogs and continuing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a cause, obviously, that's near and dear. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  I've always been a dog guy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=291.88s)]
*  So yeah, I love doing it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=293.52s)]
*  I do love the dogs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=295.48s)]
*  And we raise a ton of money and help a lot of new Miss Peaches. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=296.48s)]
*  So it's an important cause for me. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=299.48s)]
*  You know, but let me go back and let me put the—conflate the two issues a little bit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=302.48s)]
*  Gender-affirming care. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't really care what any adult does in their life. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  I believe in liberty. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=311.08s)]
*  I believe in freedom. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=312.08s)]
*  Fine with that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=313.08s)]
*  Gender-affirming treatment and care for minors without parental consent. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=314.32s)]
*  I'm guessing if anyone goes near, you know, Pete the Beagle or Miss Peaches and wants [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  to do anything without your consent as, you know, as the owner of that dog, you're going [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  to go nuts. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=332.76s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=333.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I wasn't expecting that analogy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=334.76s)]
*  But yes, I can confirm to you if I find somebody trying to do something to one of my dogs without [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=338.6s)]
*  my consent and without their consent, you may have a murder on your hands. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=345.44s)]
*  People that don't know you, they're going to say, he's calling for murder because liberals [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  have no sense of humor. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=356.56s)]
*  If you touch my dogs, I'm going to kill you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  If you mess with my dog, you're done. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=361.8s)]
*  Well, if you break into Kamala's house, she's going to pull out her Glock, but meanwhile [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  she wants gun confiscation and mandatory gun buybacks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=369.2s)]
*  Okay, I don't get it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=372.52s)]
*  You put the dog in a baby carriage and you push the dog all over the place. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=374.44s)]
*  And you know, you do all these things with the dog. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=380.24s)]
*  You spend all your time with this dog. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=382.52s)]
*  And I mean, I've never seen a better dog owner in my life. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=384.2s)]
*  What happened? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=389.24s)]
*  How did all that happen? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=390.24s)]
*  Well, I've always been a dog guy my whole life. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=391.24s)]
*  She's not a big walker. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=395.32s)]
*  She had a really bad past. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=397.12s)]
*  She was used as a breeding dog and left basically in a dump for the most part. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HS1XttsRNc&t=399.16s)]
