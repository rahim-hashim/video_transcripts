# Sean Hannity: Unity of purpose will be critical for Republicans
**Fox News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight we are broadcasting live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=0.0s)]
*  We are inside the beautiful U.S. Capitol building where Republicans now control both chambers [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=4.18s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=10.06s)]
*  And right now there is also a Republican in the White House, which brings us to a major [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=11.56s)]
*  programming note. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=17.52s)]
*  Tomorrow, 9 p.m. Eastern, join us right here on Hannity, Donald Trump's very first interview [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=18.8s)]
*  from the Oval Office of his brand new term, a time of optimism, hopefully a golden era [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=24.68s)]
*  in America, as he talked about in his inaugural address. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=30.68s)]
*  Y'all excited about that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=34.68s)]
*  We got members of Congress here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=35.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=36.68s)]
*  We got a great crowd. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=37.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=38.68s)]
*  By the way, we are all counting on you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=39.68s)]
*  Don't screw it up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But tonight was really about Washington, the House, the Senate. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=49.68s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson is going to join us, along with dozens of other Republican lawmakers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  They are on a mission. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=60.44s)]
*  They have a very small majority. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=62.36s)]
*  They have to work together with the newly sworn in president to fix what is broken in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=64.1s)]
*  the country, and there's a lot broken, and of course put America first. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=69.4s)]
*  It's not an easy task. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  Anything worthwhile is hard. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=75.16s)]
*  And they hold a slim majority. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  And after Donald Trump's recent nominees are put in power, the GOP will have at most [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=78.8s)]
*  a five-vote edge over Democrats, but they start out with only a two- to three-vote majority. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=85.36s)]
*  So needless to say, if they want to get anything done, unity of message, unity of purpose is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  going to be critical. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=97.52s)]
*  It's going to be important. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=98.52s)]
*  And look at this poll we just got tonight from Insider Advantage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=100.08s)]
*  That's Matt Tauer's group. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Seventy percent of Republican voters want lawmakers, all of you in this room with me [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=105.56s)]
*  tonight, to pass Donald Trump's appointees and his agenda, and they want you to work [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  in unison. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=116.2s)]
*  So, let's be very clear. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=117.2s)]
*  Other than Senator John Fetterman, I'm not really expecting a lot of help from the likes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=119.16s)]
*  of Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, AOC, the Radical Squad, or any Democrat to cross the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  aisle and actually govern for the sake of the people in the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  In fact, despite a landslide victory in the fall for Donald Trump, the left is still vowing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=135.4s)]
*  to resist the president with the same level of drama, hysteria that we have all come to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  expect. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=146.36s)]
*  This morning, a so-called bishop politicizing an inaugural prayer service instead of offering [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=147.36s)]
*  a benediction for our country, for our president, she goes on a far-left woke tirade in front [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, their families, their young children. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=159.4s)]
*  She made the service about her very own deranged political beliefs with a disgraceful prayer [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=163.58s)]
*  full of fear-mongering and division. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=169.62s)]
*  Listen for yourself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  We're scared now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=188.46s)]
*  families, some who fear for their lives. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=195.9s)]
*  And the people, the people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, they may not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  be citizens or have the proper documentation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=209.18s)]
*  The vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=215.34s)]
*  Well, if you come in the country illegally, you didn't respect our laws, our borders, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=218.34s)]
*  and our sovereignty. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  That would make you a criminal by definition. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  Totally inappropriate and, in my view, disgraceful. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  But in every corner of Washington, D.C., that is what Republicans are up against. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=231.9s)]
*  And that is especially true for the state-run legacy media mob that I argued died on November [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=237.4s)]
*  5th. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=242.66s)]
*  They've learned no lessons from the 2024 election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=244.42s)]
*  They're still droning on and on and on about the end of the world as we know it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=251.62s)]
*  We're talking about an attempt to portray this peaceful transition of power with people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=252.62s)]
*  who were convicted in the insurrection attempt attending, with the person who fomented the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  coup being sworn in as president, essentially a delay in the completion of the insurrection. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=266.92s)]
*  I believe that this idea of the institutions, which the Bidens clearly, truly believe in, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=273.46s)]
*  have been completely exposed by this election. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=279.3s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the nominee for Homeland Security, next to Apple CEO Tim Cook. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=282.5s)]
*  How is this happening? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  Only in America. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  How is this happening? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=289.78s)]
*  Why are people with tons of money up on the dais with cabinet nominees and family members? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=291.28s)]
*  It is a message. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=300.02s)]
*  And I think it, yeah, I think they are up there for the very reason that you probably [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=303.61999999999995s)]
*  think they're up there. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  So the state-run legacy media mob also turned their sights on Donald Trump's biggest reporters, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=309.32s)]
*  despite voting for Obama and manufacturing electric cars and creating a new type of solar [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  panel and bringing internet to rural America and revolutionizing, by the way, space travel. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=320.64s)]
*  Oh, Elon Musk is a bad guy? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Enemy number two for the legacy media? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=329.64s)]
*  Is this the same Elon Musk that made a gesture at Trump's rally, one that Democrats, we have [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=333.08s)]
*  videos and pictures of making the same gesture? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=338.78s)]
*  The guy that, you know, he's given his heart to a crowd, so-called journalists, literally [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=342.34s)]
*  accusing him. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=348.08s)]
*  They're back to Nazi, fascist, racist, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=349.08s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  And yes, that salute was evocative of things that we have seen through history. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  It was quick. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=361.36s)]
*  I think our viewers are smart and they can take a look at that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=362.36s)]
*  But it certainly was, it's not something that you typically see at American political rallies, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  put it that way. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=369.6s)]
*  No, no, it was not something that you usually would see. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=370.6s)]
*  That was a Nazi salute and he didn't just do it one time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=373.94s)]
*  He did it twice for emphasis. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  And he talked to anyone, historians, folks who actually study the Nazis and study this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=379.2s)]
*  actual kind of disgusting display, will have been very clear that what that was. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=383.64s)]
*  He should not just apologize, he should be condemned for those kinds of actions. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  So gross, disgusting, but more of what we can expect, I think, from Elon Musk and Donald [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=398.68s)]
*  What they don't like about Elon Musk is he's friends with Donald Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=400.44000000000005s)]
*  Elon is pro-freedom, pro-humanity, anti-censorship, anti-big government. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=404.24s)]
*  He spent millions to help the people in desperate need in North Carolina and people in California [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=409.6s)]
*  after those fires went out of control. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=415.0s)]
*  He's an immigrant to this country. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=417.88s)]
*  He built multiple major companies from the ground up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  He employs thousands and thousands of Americans from all backgrounds, races, religions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=422.98s)]
*  Only an idiot would call him a Nazi. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=429.16s)]
*  But that's what NBC News did. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=432.04s)]
*  And they obviously have not come to the realization that legacy media is dead. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  Lying and peddling conspiracy theories will lead to a massive decline in viewership. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=438.44s)]
*  We see this unfolding in real time before our eyes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=443.74s)]
*  But after the past, you know, 10 years, I think it's safe to say that there's no shortage [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  of idiots doubling down on stupid in the media mob. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=451.2s)]
*  But their influence and their power is waning, and all of you know it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=455.24s)]
*  And they want this Congress to enact Trump's America's First Agenda. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=459.9s)]
*  And tonight, I am joined by the people that will make that happen, many of the lawmakers [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=464.08s)]
*  responsible for getting this agenda across the finish line to help improve your lives, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=469.24s)]
*  make your towns, your cities more safe, more secure, and to put more money in your family's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=475.42s)]
*  pocket and make us the richest country on earth with energy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pZMmxIpJt4&t=480.5s)]
