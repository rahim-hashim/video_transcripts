# Byron Donalds: This will not go well for Nikki Haley
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw)
*  Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer and former senior advisor to President Trump Stephen Miller and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Byron Donalds is right here on set with us in New Hampshire. How are you? Good to see you. I'm doing good [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=6.04s)]
*  How are you? I'm good. Okay analyze tonight. What do you see big night for President Trump? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=10.92s)]
*  Look, this thing is over. We know this this is gonna be Nikki Haley's biggest opportunity [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=16.84s)]
*  She's ten points down with 50% of the vote in this is like when you start off on those rollercoasters [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=21.28s)]
*  Sean and you start really low that's where she started one two percent you crest all the way up [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  You think things are going well and then you go over the edge and it's downhill from there [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=29.84s)]
*  South Carolina is not going to go well for her. Nevada is not gonna go well for her [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=33.72s)]
*  Florida is not gonna go well for her. It's time for the party to unite this primary is over [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=37.96s)]
*  But she wants to hang around so we're gonna have to beat her in a couple more states. Ari Fleischer your take sir [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=43.04s)]
*  Yeah, unless Nikki Haley is able to make deeper in routes with the group that represents most Republicans, which is conservative Republicans [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  I think she's gonna hit a plateau and she might be there right now with about 45% [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=54.76s)]
*  In a state that's quite friendly toward a Nikki Haley candidacy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=59.36s)]
*  So when she says she started 2% and has moved up [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  She's right and she should get credit for being the last woman standing but in politics that's not good enough [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=65.96s)]
*  And then there are the fundamental things she hasn't come to terms with yet is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Conservatives love Donald Trump and she hasn't been able to crack that that'll be a problem in South Carolina as well. I suspect [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=76.12s)]
*  All right, we can see that that Trump is up a full tempo percentage points right now Stephen Miller [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  People that I know crunching numbers texting me, you know, they think the numbers gonna be closer to 13 14. Maybe even 15% [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=89.36s)]
*  Regardless, I agree with Ari if there was a state that was suited for a more independent more moderate Republican [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  It would be the state of New Hampshire [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  And then heading into your own home state four years from now, there's gonna be an open primary [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=107.44s)]
*  Does Nikki Haley if you're a campaign manager and you want her to be president one day? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=112.56s)]
*  Does she look at the idea of maybe losing her home state right now down? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=118.24s)]
*  30.2 percent real clear politics average. Does she take that risk and continue or is it better to say? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=122.84s)]
*  I'll come back in four years and I think I'll have a better opportunity [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=129.28s)]
*  Well, you would think that she would try to avoid the staggering humiliation of what is setting up to be a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=132.88s)]
*  Historic defeat in her home state and as your other guests have mentioned New Hampshire was where she bet everything [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=139.28s)]
*  It would have been the perfect state for her and not only is she going to lose by significant double-digit margin [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=146.2s)]
*  But she's going to lose despite the fact that a record number of unaffiliated and Democrat voters particularly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=153.6s)]
*  In the primary a record low according to exit polls [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=160.68s)]
*  47 percent of New Hampshire Republican primary voters were actually [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  Republican and yet Donald Trump still notched this massive victory [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=169.52s)]
*  So it's an even more significant victory that it appears on paper for Donald Trump tonight [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=173.44s)]
*  You know, I agree. I got to tell you so as you go from here if you're Donald Trump [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=178.24s)]
*  Do you start beginning the transition to a? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=184.68s)]
*  General campaign against Joe Biden. I would like to see more focus on Biden than maybe Nikki Haley [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=187.92s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be necessary in the next two states. Well, I totally believe that's what needs to happen [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=192.92s)]
*  Over at the at Joe Biden's campaign. They're already starting to gear up in their mind [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=197.88s)]
*  They think it's about about Donald Trump and that's gonna be their focus [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  That needs to be the focus of the Republican Party in the Trump campaign. It's about November Sean [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  The primary contest is over. Do you think it's over Ari Fleischer 10 seconds? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=210.56s)]
*  I don't think it's over but I think Donald Trump missed an opportunity tonight in that speech [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  He should have gone after Joe Biden and ignored Nikki Haley and those are opportunities [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  You don't get too often set of sights on Biden. That's a smart thing for Donald Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=223.04s)]
*  I would have preferred to hear more about Biden. All right. Thank you all three Stephen. Thank you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEluB5im_vw&t=226.84s)]
