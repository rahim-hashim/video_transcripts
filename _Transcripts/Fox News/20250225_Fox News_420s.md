# Karoline Leavitt: 'Deranged' Dems continue to deny reality
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0)
*  All right, it's now time for our Hannity-Washington briefing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=0.0s)]
*  We welcome back White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt is with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=3.94s)]
*  You know, the AP deal is a big deal to me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=6.88s)]
*  And this, frankly, you have reconfigured that room quite a bit, and you've invited in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=9.28s)]
*  bloggers and invited in other media that traditionally have not been there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=14.36s)]
*  But I would go back and say that most of the mainstream legacy media, they were wrong on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=20.52s)]
*  and they were wrong on the case of New York. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=26.32s)]
*  They were wrong on pretty much everything involving Donald Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=32.24s)]
*  And they never corrected themselves, did they? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=35.84s)]
*  They never did, Sean. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And the winning continues here at the White House every day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  Today, a federal judge right here in Washington, D.C., denied the Associated Press's emergency [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  request for a temporary restraining order to restore their privilege of returning to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=51.24s)]
*  the White House press pool. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=57.88s)]
*  And the judge's denial of the Associated Press's request reinforces what I said from the podium [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  last week and what President Trump has been saying. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=65.48s)]
*  Covering the American presidency in the most intimate and limited spaces in this White [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  House, in the Oval Office, on the Air Force One is a privilege. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=73.62s)]
*  It is not a legal right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=77.76s)]
*  We want all voices to have that opportunity, and that's why we've expanded the James S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=79.88s)]
*  Brady briefing room to invite truly legitimate independent journalists, podcasters and other [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=84.44s)]
*  media types into that room to cover this president with honesty and accuracy and with real mindfulness [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=90.8s)]
*  of what the American people actually care about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=97.88s)]
*  I also want to thank you tonight, Sean, for fact-checking James Carville for the lies [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  that he pushed on your program last week. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=104.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, James represents the deranged and out-of-touch Democrat Party who continue [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=107.64s)]
*  to deny the reality that this country loves Donald Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, President Trump is enjoying his highest approval rating from the American [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=117.72s)]
*  people than he ever has, despite the years of lies, smears and witch hunts by the Democrat [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=122.08s)]
*  Party. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=128.2s)]
*  The Harvard-Harris poll today is incredible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=129.2s)]
*  When you look issue by issue, the vast majority of the American people support what President [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=133.0s)]
*  Trump is doing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  You showed it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=139.64s)]
*  Eighty-one percent of the American people support deporting illegal migrant criminals [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=140.64s)]
*  from our nation's communities. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Seventy-seven percent of Americans support a full audit into the waste and fraud that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=148.04s)]
*  this federal government has been spending their tax dollars on, and that is the exact [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=153.64s)]
*  mission of DOJ. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=158.42s)]
*  So these numbers, these approval ratings are what you get when you have a president who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=160.36s)]
*  actually does what he promised he was going to do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=164.48s)]
*  And that's why the Democrats are facing their worst, lowest approval rating since 2018. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=167.76s)]
*  Not even 40 percent of the American public supports the current Democrat Party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=174.68s)]
*  President Trump will continue to abide by the will of the American people who elected [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=179.6s)]
*  him to this big, beautiful White House behind me, and we are restoring common sense to our [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=183.44s)]
*  great country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=188.84s)]
*  You know, I just showed this audience Harvard-Harris and where they stand on DOJ and cutting back [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=189.84s)]
*  wasteful spending. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  I showed CBS. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  All weekend long, if you look at CBS, they're not even looking at their own poll. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  The New York Times, USA Today, MSDNC, The Washington Post, CNN, Fake News, Huffington [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=202.84s)]
*  Post, Newsweek. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  They all had some version. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  GOP lawmaker confronted by constituents, angry with the Trump-must cuts. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=211.56s)]
*  It is contradicted, Caroline, by their own polls. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  And we're not talking about 55 percent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Seventy-eight, 80 percent of the American people don't want—they don't want their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=224.6s)]
*  money spent this way and they don't want their children and grandchildren robbed this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=231.28s)]
*  way. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  And this is what Democrats call a constitutional crisis, and this is what the media falsely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=236.48s)]
*  reports on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=241.0s)]
*  It's difficult to penetrate through that wall of, you know, frankly, propaganda and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=242.08s)]
*  lies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=247.28s)]
*  There are a lot of lies from the left, especially from the Democrat Party and, as you said, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=248.28s)]
*  their propagandists and the left-wing legacy media. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=253.8s)]
*  But the president and our administration are cutting through those lies every single day [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=256.92s)]
*  with a mega level of access and transparency to the commander-in-chief. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=262.0s)]
*  Nearly every single day, President Trump invites journalists into the Oval Office and gives [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=267.52s)]
*  them the facts and the truth because he has that on his side. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=272.24s)]
*  And he is doing so much, accomplishing so much, that the mainstream media can't even [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=276.04s)]
*  cover it all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=280.26s)]
*  I mean, today we had a major announcement on a Monday morning that Apple, one of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=281.26s)]
*  biggest companies in this world, is going to invest $500 billion right here in the United [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=285.64s)]
*  States of America and create 20,000 new jobs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=292.08s)]
*  America is open for business again because of the policies and the confidence that has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=296.32s)]
*  been restored across this world because of President Trump being behind the Resolute [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=301.48s)]
*  Desk. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=306.64s)]
*  And I just saw President Trump's statement, in case your audience has it, from a few moments [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=307.64s)]
*  ago. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=311.2s)]
*  He says, our country is doing very well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=312.2s)]
*  And he was just thinking about the company that was shooed away and canceled by the Biden [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=314.0s)]
*  administration who wanted to build the Keystone XL pipeline. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=318.88s)]
*  He is inviting them back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=322.12s)]
*  We want the Keystone XL pipeline built. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=323.64s)]
*  He wants a pipeline built in the Northeast, in New England, where I am from, where we [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=325.96s)]
*  have some of the highest electricity and utility rates in the country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  This is a president who is constantly thinking about how he can help the American people, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=333.9s)]
*  innovating and pushing groundbreaking ideas on every single issue. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=339.2s)]
*  And that's, again, why the vast majority of Americans are seeing through the mainstream [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=343.88s)]
*  media and the Democrat Party's lies, because they are seeing real results come from this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=347.84s)]
*  administration every single day. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  How quickly do you think or anticipate the president will meet with President Zelensky [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=355.84s)]
*  and President Putin? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=360.84s)]
*  We expect those meetings to take place very soon, especially the meeting with President [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  And as the president expressed today, he wants the critical minerals and rare earths deal [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  signed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  It is going to recoup American tax dollars for the hundreds of billions of dollars that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  we have paid for Ukraine's national defense. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  He expects President Zelensky to sign that deal. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=380.64s)]
*  It's only right considering what the American taxpayers have done for Ukraine. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=383.24s)]
*  If it were not for the American people, Ukraine wouldn't be a country anymore. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=387.24s)]
*  President Trump knows that and he's getting the American people what they deserve. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=390.88s)]
*  Well, and also will help them to have our partnership and us on the ground helping them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=393.88s)]
*  You know, that'll give them money to rebuild their country, which is a disaster right now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  And the killing does have to end. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=404.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=405.04s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, we appreciate it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=406.04s)]
*  The White House briefing with Caroline. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKXT9VDkp0&t=407.04s)]
