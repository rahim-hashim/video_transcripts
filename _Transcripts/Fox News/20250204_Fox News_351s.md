# Sen. Kennedy: Democrats are ’screaming like they’re part of a prison riot’
**Fox News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0)
*  That'd be a good idea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=0.0s)]
*  Here now, Senator Kennedy, Louisiana, congratulations, Super Bowl, all eyes on New Orleans and your [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=2.32s)]
*  great state, sir. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=7.8s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=9.36s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=10.36s)]
*  Let me say first, Sean, that it's kind of cool having a president again. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=11.36s)]
*  Let me try to put all this in context for you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=20.68s)]
*  I like omelets. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=25.16s)]
*  I mean, I really like omelets. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=26.16s)]
*  I could eat an omelet at every meal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=28.04s)]
*  I like omelets better than sex. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=32.0s)]
*  Not really, but you get the point. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=37.84s)]
*  I like omelets. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  Now, President Trump ran for office saying, I'm going to review every single penny in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=44.08s)]
*  the federal budget. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, how are you going to review the spending in the federal budget without reviewing the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=54.52s)]
*  spending? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  And that's what Mr. Musk is doing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=61.88s)]
*  Now, many of my Democratic colleagues and some of the tofu-eating Wokorati at the USAID [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=64.56s)]
*  like they're part of a prison riot because they don't want us reviewing the spending. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=78.32s)]
*  But that's all Mr. Musk is doing, and he's finding some pretty interesting stuff. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  To my friends who are upset, I would say with respect, call somebody who cares. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  They better get used to this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  It's USAID today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be Department of Education tomorrow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=102.08s)]
*  And really, here's what's going on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=104.72s)]
*  For four years under President Biden, the people in charge ask one simple question. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=106.9s)]
*  Who needs to pay more in taxes? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  Who needs to pay more in taxes? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=115.62s)]
*  Well, that's not the question that the Republicans and President Trump are going to ask. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  Our question is, what the hell happened to the money? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=123.54s)]
*  And that's all that's going on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  $520 million for consultant-driven ESG investments in Africa, $45 million to DEI scholarships [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=130.82s)]
*  in Burma. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Why are your Democratic colleagues seemingly more freaked out about cutting USAID? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  This is our money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=144.42s)]
*  Do you know how much a million dollars is? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=145.42s)]
*  $520? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=147.38s)]
*  I mean, we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars over the years on this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=148.38s)]
*  Madness. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=154.18s)]
*  What are they thinking? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=155.18s)]
*  We have $40 trillion in debt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=156.18s)]
*  If you notice, my Democratic colleagues and the USAID officials, they're not defending [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=159.7s)]
*  the spending. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=165.7s)]
*  All they're talking about is process. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=167.26s)]
*  Oh, it's an insurrection. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=169.14s)]
*  And Elon Musk doesn't have the authority. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=171.94s)]
*  Well, sure, he has the authority. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=173.94s)]
*  The president gave it to him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  And all he's doing is looking at the spending, just what the president said he was going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=177.94s)]
*  to appoint Musk to do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=182.7s)]
*  Here's what I hope Rubio and Musk do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=185.26s)]
*  I would put together all this absurd spending into a booklet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=188.14s)]
*  I'd call a press conference. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=193.06s)]
*  And in front of God and country and the corporate media and the USAID folks and my Democratic [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=195.14s)]
*  colleagues, I'd go over it, item by item by item, every bit of it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=201.42s)]
*  The DEI comic books, the transgender operas, the funding of gain-of-function research. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=206.5s)]
*  I'd go over every bit of it and say, now, do you want to defend this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=214.5s)]
*  And they won't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=219.22s)]
*  They can't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=220.22s)]
*  They really can't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=221.22s)]
*  Let me shift gears a little bit and ask you about Cash Patel and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard picked up support from Senator Susan Collins today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe, after speaking with your colleagues, that Republicans will hold the line and give [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  the president the cabinet he's requested? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=244.58s)]
*  I mean, I haven't done what we call whip count and talked to every particular senator, but [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=245.58s)]
*  we're together every day and you kind of get a feel for things. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=251.78s)]
*  And it's, I think in only four or five instances, have presidents of a particular party not had [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=256.58s)]
*  senators of the same party support his nominees. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=265.82s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to change this time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=269.7s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=272.9s)]
*  I mean, if there were one person I would say is sort of on the bubble, and I don't want [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=273.9s)]
*  to overstate this, it's Ms. Gabbard. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=277.14s)]
*  But I saw the day where Senator Collins is going to support her and that will probably [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  be enough. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=287.02s)]
*  That's my best guess at this point. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't tell my colleagues how to vote, Sean. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=289.9s)]
*  I tell them to follow their heart, but take their brain with them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=292.5s)]
*  Now, you don't want to revise and extend those remarks, do you, about your omelet? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=297.46s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=305.46s)]
*  Omelets aren't better than sex, but you get the point. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=307.46s)]
*  I like omelets, man. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=310.18s)]
*  Did I mention that I like omelets? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=311.7s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=315.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=316.46s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us, Senator Kennedy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=317.7s)]
*  I'm sure you go to the Super Bowl, by the way? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=321.14s)]
*  You have any predictions? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  I am. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  Any predictions? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=325.86s)]
*  No. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=326.86s)]
*  No. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=327.86s)]
*  I don't even know who I'm going to pull for. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=328.86s)]
*  I'm still upset over the lucret trade to the L.A. makers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=330.62s)]
*  You wanted the Saints in there, I know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=335.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you, Senator. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9y2Mlgbgm0&t=340.02000000000004s)]
