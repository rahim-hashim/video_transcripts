# Ted Cruz: Eisenhower, Reagan handled campus chaos much better than Biden
**Fox News:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s)
*  All right, joining us now, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who's being called into a vote. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=0.0s)]
*  I know you don't have a lot of time, Senator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Great to have you back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=6.68s)]
*  Before I get to the issue of this aid package, and I read your comments about it, I think [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=8.64s)]
*  I agree with every word that you wrote. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=13.16s)]
*  I'm conflicted as you are. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=15.08s)]
*  There are things that I support, like aid for Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=16.48s)]
*  There's not a penny in this bill for what's happening at the border in your state and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  in Arizona and California. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  First, let me get your reaction to these radical students on campus, Joe Biden's appeasement [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=28.44s)]
*  to some of the worst terrorist states in the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=34.28s)]
*  What's your overall reaction? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=37.8s)]
*  Listen, what we're seeing at universities is absolutely horrific. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=39.28s)]
*  This anti-Semitism, this hatred, this violence, these threats directed at Jewish students [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=43.08s)]
*  should be utterly unacceptable. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  At Columbia University, the Orthodox rabbi advised Jewish students, go home and stay [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=52.44s)]
*  home because the university will not protect your safety. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=57.72s)]
*  Columbia University also barred one of its own professors, a Jewish professor, from coming [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=61.16s)]
*  on campus because they concluded they would not protect his safety. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=66.16s)]
*  And understand, these administrators and many of these faculty members side with the radicals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=70.24s)]
*  We saw an image this weekend of presumably a Columbia student, and by the way, by all [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=76.16s)]
*  appearances, not a Palestinian, but a young blonde woman, standing there with an Arab [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=81.4s)]
*  headscarf and holding a sign. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=87.4s)]
*  And she's standing in front of several Jewish students behind her who have Israeli flags [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=90.36s)]
*  and American flags. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=95.8s)]
*  And her sign says Al Qassam's next target with an arrow at these Jewish students. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=96.8s)]
*  Al Qassam is Hamas's military arm. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=102.44s)]
*  She is literally advocating that terrorists murder her fellow students. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=105.44s)]
*  If you had any administrators that were sane, any student that advocates terrorist murder [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=110.36s)]
*  fellow students would be expelled on the spot. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=116.68s)]
*  If you are threatening other students, you should be arrested and you should be expelled. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=119.88s)]
*  And by the way, that's true if you were threatening Jewish students or you were threatening Palestinian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=124.0s)]
*  students or anybody else. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=128.36s)]
*  You don't have a right to engage in threats of violence. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  And the problem is these administrators agree with the anti-Semites on the street, and so [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=133.72s)]
*  does the Biden White House. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=139.16s)]
*  You know, the Biden Twitter account, he has yet to say a word about what's happened at [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=140.4s)]
*  Columbia, what's happened at Yale, what's happened at NYU. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=145.32s)]
*  He's got over 30 million followers, but he will not say a word. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=148.4s)]
*  And just this weekend, Joe Biden stood side by side with AOC while she praised these anti-Semitic [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=151.72s)]
*  protesters at NYU and Yale and Columbia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=160.72s)]
*  This is their base. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=163.88s)]
*  This is the Democrat Party. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=165.32s)]
*  And Joe Biden sat there with a goofy grin on his face and said, you got to listen to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=167.28s)]
*  this woman, a sitting member of Congress. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  It is disgraceful. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=173.76s)]
*  Sean, I'll tell you what a real president would do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=174.76s)]
*  A real president would say Jewish students are going to be safe on our campuses, and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=177.64s)]
*  if the universities will not protect them, the federal government will. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=181.92s)]
*  And if need be, we'll send in the National Guard like Eisenhower did when Democrat senators [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  refused to integrate schools. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  A real president would say federal law enforcement will be there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=192.64s)]
*  You will not be subject to violence, but Joe Biden won't say that because he's terrified [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=196.08s)]
*  of ticking off the radical left in his own party. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, remember, Joe also stood with the former Klansman Robert Byrd, his mentor and his friend, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  and didn't want the integration of schools or school busing because he didn't want schools [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=211.0s)]
*  to become racial jungles, he said. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=216.56s)]
*  Nobody in the media seems to remember that but me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  Last question. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=221.52s)]
*  I know you have to run. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=222.52s)]
*  Go, leave. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=223.96s)]
*  I'll take over for you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=224.96s)]
*  But if you can get it in, you're about to vote on this aid package. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  I read your statement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=230.8s)]
*  I agreed with 99.9% of it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=232.0s)]
*  So Sean, I'm going to vote no, but I will tell you this is a very close call, and I struggled [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=236.0s)]
*  for a long time with how to vote because there are elements of this bill I really, really [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=240.0s)]
*  strongly support. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=244.28s)]
*  This has military aid for Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  Israel is in the middle of a war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  We should have provided this emergency military aid six months ago. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=249.8s)]
*  In November, I joined several other senators. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  We forced a vote on the Senate floor to provide emergency military aid to Israel in November, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=256.36s)]
*  and every single Democrat voted no. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=262.62s)]
*  And every day since then, the delay in military aid has been because the Democrats were blocking [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  I also support what they're doing on TikTok, but I can't support this bill ultimately because [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  it gives money to Gaza, it gives money for the NGOs that are trafficking illegal immigrants, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=275.24s)]
*  and it does nothing, zero, to stop the invasion at our southern border. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=281.24s)]
*  That's got to be our priority. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=285.88s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=288.24s)]
*  The border and the budget, it's not complicated. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=289.76s)]
*  That's why 195 days matters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=292.72s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=294.92s)]
*  I know you have to run. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXME9D4Bc3s&t=296.64s)]
