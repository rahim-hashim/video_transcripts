# Mike Huckabee: It's a great day in America
**Fox News:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI)
*  Fox News contributors Jason Chaffetz and Joe Concha and Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=0.0s)]
*  to Israel, Mike Huckabee, is with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=6.78s)]
*  Let's start with you, governor. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=9.6s)]
*  Let's get your take. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=11.28s)]
*  I can't—for the life of me, governor, I do a lot of research every day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=12.66s)]
*  And I know Joni Ernst was looking for this information, the specifics of the money that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  it spent. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=23.26s)]
*  And they wouldn't give a tour. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=24.32s)]
*  And it's only because of Elon Musk and President Trump that we know this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=26.1s)]
*  What are your—what's your reaction to it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=30.14s)]
*  Because I'm angry. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  Well, I just think you're wrong about some things, Sean. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=32.9s)]
*  You said that this could be the most consequential president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=37.1s)]
*  I think he already has been in three weeks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=41.1s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=43.74s)]
*  I'm going to the emergency room later tonight because I have whiplash from what is happening [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=45.34s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=50.1s)]
*  And the fact that they've taken things that have been sacred cows for a long time—let's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=51.62s)]
*  look at USAID. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=56.82s)]
*  Look, I'm the first to admit that there are some things in USAID. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=57.82s)]
*  PEPFAR, for example, started by George W. Bush, saved millions of lives from AIDS. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=61.54s)]
*  Good thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=66.42s)]
*  But if you have a stew pot and you've cooked stew in it, and it's been good, but then you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=67.42s)]
*  start putting poison in there, you don't say, well, let's just keep serving because there's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=71.4s)]
*  some good stuff at the bottom of the pot. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=76.02s)]
*  You dump it all out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=78.28s)]
*  You clean the pot and scrub it good, and you just make stew and nothing but stew. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=79.86s)]
*  That's what Trump is doing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=85.9s)]
*  I think it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=87.1s)]
*  I never thought we would cut through some of this red tape and nonsense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=90.6s)]
*  But when these things are being discovered, let's let the Democrats go and scream at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=94.94s)]
*  that guy at the door of the Department of Ed, who, by the way, I think was barred from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=99.62s)]
*  Buckingham Palace because nobody has ever been so stoic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=103.76s)]
*  This guy's got a career wherever he wants to go. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  It's a great day in America today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=111.32s)]
*  You know, Jason, you are looking as a congressman for this type of reckless spending. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=113.96s)]
*  And what's so sinister about this is they purposely hid it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=121.96s)]
*  They didn't put the specifics of where the money was really going. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=126.82s)]
*  It was only when Elon got into the—was able to do that deep dive, did we really find [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=130.34s)]
*  out, because they knew the American people would be outraged by this, but they did it anyway. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=137.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and look at what the Democrats are fighting for. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  They just can't give away the American money fast enough overseas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  But what about the $36 trillion, trillion dollars we're in debt? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=151.46s)]
*  We spend almost $3 billion a day just servicing that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  That's our interest, our daily interest payment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=160.22000000000003s)]
*  So you want more roads, bridges, infrastructure, all that? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=162.84s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  We're spending $3 billion just trying to pay and service the debt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=167.34s)]
*  So they start throwing away on this money. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=170.26s)]
*  You got to be kidding me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=172.66s)]
*  And look, guys like me, I was on the Oversight Committee, I was the chair of the Oversight [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=174.5s)]
*  Committee. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  They wouldn't give us that information. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  We asked for that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=179.92s)]
*  I fought the USID for years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=180.92s)]
*  They would never cough that up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=183.72s)]
*  And for Maxine Waters to show up at the front door and berate a federal public employee, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=185.7s)]
*  I hope he sues their butt, because there's no right for them to do that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=190.54s)]
*  We do have in this country... [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=194.98s)]
*  She was saying, take a good look at him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=195.98s)]
*  Everybody needs to look at him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=197.5s)]
*  Is she threatening him and his family? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=199.1s)]
*  I think it's a threat. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=202.9s)]
*  And there's separation of powers. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=204.46s)]
*  You can't, as a congressman, go over to the judiciary branch and start walking around [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=206.22s)]
*  saying, hey, where's Clarence? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=210.14s)]
*  I want to just go check him out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=211.5s)]
*  You can't have the executive branch go walk into a member of Congress's office and go [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=213.62s)]
*  say, oh, I want to go meet with the staff. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=218.38s)]
*  That's not the way it works in this country, Maxine Waters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=220.8s)]
*  And all of those other Democrats who just think it's funny to berate a guy who's probably [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=224.33999999999997s)]
*  got his own family, his own reputation, he doesn't need to be a national figure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=228.42s)]
*  Shame on her. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=232.98s)]
*  She should be censored by the House of Representatives. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=233.98s)]
*  There is no shame. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=237.42s)]
*  She's the one that said, get in their faces, follow them into the store and the shops, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=238.66s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=243.38s)]
*  Joe Concha, there is a complicit group here, and that is the state-run legacy media mob. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=244.38s)]
*  And that is, they are feigning all of this outrage. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=250.94s)]
*  They are, you know, right there with the Democrats and trying to demonize Elon Musk, who I think [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=254.66s)]
*  has done the country a great service, as well as the president. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=261.18s)]
*  In our resistance legacy media, Sean, every day is now festivous. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=266.02s)]
*  Every day in the pages of The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=270.58s)]
*  Every day in the Trump 2.0 era is an unhinged airing of grievances. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=276.46s)]
*  It's a festivous, just not for the rest of us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=281.78s)]
*  And to your point, they have no positive message. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=284.58s)]
*  They don't have any objectivity in terms of the way that they're reporting this stuff. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=287.7s)]
*  They go after Elon Musk, and they try to character-assassinate him, but nobody's talking about, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=291.9s)]
*  the stuff that Elon Musk is finding. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=297.62s)]
*  That's the story. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=300.7s)]
*  If you're a journalist, it is such widespread corruption. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=301.74s)]
*  I mean, I think we all knew that it was bad, but just in the first 19 days, what he is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  finding is just overwhelmingly devastating. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  And I love that Washington Post op-ed, by the way, that you read before, that Donald [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=313.14s)]
*  Trump is the most damaging president in the first two weeks of his presidency in history. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=316.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's been damaging, all right, to the status quo, to government waste, to biological [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=320.58s)]
*  men competing against biological women in sports. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  He's been absolutely damaging to murderers and rapists in this country by signing the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  Lakin-Reilly Act, a bill that somehow 148 Democrats in Congress opposed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=331.78s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=337.5s)]
*  This is the position that they are taking. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  An overwhelming number of voters are screaming for major changes to the way government does [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  business, all the waste, all the corruption out there in broad daylight. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=345.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, did you see? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  You had a nice list there before, but there was one that really caught my eye. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  USAID gave more than $300 million to a cement company in Gaza, owned by Hamas, which was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=355.22s)]
*  used to build tunnels for them to house weapons, fighters and eventually hostages, including [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=361.98s)]
*  Americans. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  But democracy is what, I guess, Democrats are defending, but when they say they're [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  defending democracy, they really mean they're defending bureaucracy, Sean. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=373.06s)]
*  And if they want to die on this hill and they want to be the party that protects, you know, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=377.62s)]
*  illegal immigrants and including cartel members, known terrorists, rapists, murderers and gang [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=383.02s)]
*  members, let them be that party. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=390.26s)]
*  If they want to be the party that's fighting for men to play in women's sports, let them [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=392.02s)]
*  be that party. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=395.62s)]
*  If they want to be the party that supports all of, you know, all these American hard-earned [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=396.62s)]
*  tax dollars going abroad for their woke policies and Green New Deal, let them be that party, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  because they'll never win another election ever. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=408.58s)]
*  Guys, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVnzDOZ-TI&t=411.5s)]
