# James Carville and Hannity spar over illegal immigration and national security risks
**Fox News:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o)
*  All right, earlier this week, I had the opportunity to sit down with my old friend, Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=0.0s)]
*  strategist James Carville. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here's part two of that interview. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=5.96s)]
*  James, we have now identified, because of Harris and Biden open borders, hundreds of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=8.6s)]
*  people with known terror ties in this country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=16.76s)]
*  We have tens and tens of thousands from China, Russia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=19.6s)]
*  They're coming from Iran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=22.44s)]
*  They're coming from Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan and Venezuela. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=23.84s)]
*  Is that not a national security danger to this country? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=27.76s)]
*  Because I see it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Well, first of all, it is well documented that immigrants have much lower common rates [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=32.6s)]
*  than Native American. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=40.36s)]
*  The second thing I would say, I completely agree. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=42.08s)]
*  These are human beings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  They're members of the human race. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=46.2s)]
*  All right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=48.36s)]
*  And they should not be denied healthcare. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=49.56s)]
*  Now, if you have a woman who takes a 10-year-old or a 6-year-old and walks 500 miles to get [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  in this country from Guatemala because she's being overrun by drug gangs, do I think this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=57.76s)]
*  woman should be admitted and her children as citizens? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=62.92s)]
*  Heck yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=66.24s)]
*  Come in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=67.48s)]
*  Come in, girl. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=68.48s)]
*  We got a job for you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=69.48s)]
*  Why can't they go through the legal? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=70.48s)]
*  But James, why can't they just do it legally? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=73.8s)]
*  We can vet them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=76.84s)]
*  Do you really believe that people coming from Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, China and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=77.92s)]
*  Russia, do you think they're coming here because they want a better life? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=82.92s)]
*  Is that what you really believe? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, Sean, certainly when you have laws, I don't believe we should deny any human [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  being healthcare. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=95.72s)]
*  If you show up at the emergency room, I think the Hippocratic oath compels you, and I think [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=96.72s)]
*  being a Catholic compels me to say this person is entitled to healthcare, is entitled to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=102.56s)]
*  basic human rights. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=107.2s)]
*  Should we have a border? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=109.04s)]
*  Yes, we should have a border. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=110.84s)]
*  You know, and maybe we need fences, but we need big gates, and I will say this to my [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=113.28s)]
*  dying day, I would rather live in a country that people are trying to get into than live [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=118.4s)]
*  in a country that people are trying to get out of. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  I just do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=124.8s)]
*  But the reality, we have never had illegal immigration at this level, and I believe it's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=125.96s)]
*  a clear and present danger for you, for your family, for your children, and we're rewarding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=132.4s)]
*  that illegal immigration behavior and it's wreaking havoc. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=138.04s)]
*  What do you say to Lake and Riley's family? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=142.72s)]
*  What do you say to Rachel Moore and the mother of five's family? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  What do you say to Jocelyn Nungary's family? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=147.52s)]
*  I interviewed her mom and her granddad on my program right here, and they lost their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=150.12s)]
*  12-year-old little girl in Houston, and it was killed by one of Harris and Biden's unvetted [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=159.68s)]
*  What do you say to them, James? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=160.68s)]
*  You love your children? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=161.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=162.8s)]
*  I would have great difficulties, anyone have great difficulties telling their parents and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=163.8s)]
*  How are your children slaughtered with a legal weapon that no one has any need to have? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=168.32s)]
*  You're changing the topic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=174.44s)]
*  I would say the same thing to the people in Buffalo. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=175.44s)]
*  They'd be alive if we secured the border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=176.44s)]
*  I'm not changing the topic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=177.44s)]
*  I'm telling you, the border had nothing to do with Ivaldi. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=180.44s)]
*  The border had nothing to do with Buffalo. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=185.6s)]
*  They entered the country with open borders. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=187.6s)]
*  The border had nothing to do with, again, the boarding had nothing to do with this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=188.6s)]
*  Please fact check me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Please fact check me. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=195.64s)]
*  The border had nothing to do with these mass shootings, with these AR-15s. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=196.72s)]
*  We all have difficult questions that we have to ask. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Anybody can say that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  We can sit in the peanut gallery and throw peanuts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  But I do think we can have, I think border crossings right now are about the same as [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  they were when President Biden took office. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=216.48s)]
*  Was that, I think, ineffective boarding policy at one time? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=223.44s)]
*  They did what I said—you showed me saying at the beginning of the show. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=224.44s)]
*  When you listen to these, quote, identity progressive left-wingers, it's always going [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=228.0s)]
*  to lead—it always leads to bad policy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  But right now, when you look at the Senator Lankford and Senator Murphy's plan, that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=235.84s)]
*  was negotiated, and Donald Trump killed it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=240.56s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=243.04s)]
*  Y'all can fact check me— [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=244.04s)]
*  Donald Trump killed the plan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=245.04s)]
*  —the day it dropped. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=246.04s)]
*  That plan, to be clear, would not have been implemented unless a few million people crossed [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=247.52s)]
*  the border on any given day, and then it would be discretionary. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=252.56s)]
*  They wouldn't have to even implement the plan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=255.28s)]
*  That's not a border security plan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=257.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=259.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=260.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=261.16s)]
*  So, all right, you're supporting Harris and Walz. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=262.16s)]
*  Tell me why—tell me—I want you to answer two questions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=263.44s)]
*  I want you to answer, is America better off than it was four years ago, number one? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=268.2s)]
*  Number two, I want you to tell me specifically, no distractions, no obfuscations, what has [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=272.22s)]
*  Kamala Harris done as vice president that warrants a promotion? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=278.52s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=282.52s)]
*  It's demonstratively better off than it was four years ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=285.32s)]
*  Look at the employment rate four years ago. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=287.88s)]
*  Look at the stock market four years ago. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=289.8s)]
*  Look at the crime rate four years ago. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=291.86s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=294.32s)]
*  You're up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=295.32s)]
*  Crime is up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=296.32s)]
*  Joe Biden—again, I'll let you ask me questions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=297.32s)]
*  Please let me answer questions, OK? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=302.0s)]
*  I'm giving you very specific metrics to look at. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=303.0s)]
*  And if you ask me, is the country better off today than it was four years ago, my answer [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=306.32s)]
*  is heck yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  All right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=313.08s)]
*  Period. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=314.08s)]
*  End of story. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=315.08s)]
*  That's James Carville's view. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=316.08s)]
*  All right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=317.64s)]
*  So if—are there things that we need to work on? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  By the way, the crime rates drop almost to historic levels. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=322.64s)]
*  And I keep hearing Trump talking about rising crime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=327.08s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=329.8s)]
*  I hear people talk about these urban hellholes, and I'm sitting here in Chicago. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  And tell you the truth, it's a pretty damn nice city. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=339.16s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=340.16s)]
*  James, James, 30 people were shot this weekend. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=341.16s)]
*  Five are dead. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=344.0s)]
*  Not exactly safe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=345.68s)]
*  And I have scrolled the names of people shot, shot and killed in this city. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=346.68s)]
*  Let me ask you a couple of—I think what are very extreme positions of Kamala Harris. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you think it's a good idea, when she says to ban fracking and drilling, do you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=356.12s)]
*  think that's good for our economy to do that? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=360.44s)]
*  No. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=362.44s)]
*  Do you support it? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=363.44s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=364.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=365.44s)]
*  I got one concession out of you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=366.44s)]
*  I think that fracking is a transition thing, and I don't think she has that position today. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=367.44s)]
*  And I think human beings evolve, and I think they have experience. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=372.76s)]
*  And I know there are many things that I thought—for instance, in 2008, I always point out, President [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=377.52s)]
*  Obama and Secretary Clinton were against gay marriage. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=382.88s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  They're not anymore. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=386.67999999999995s)]
*  Good for them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  All right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=388.67999999999995s)]
*  And when somebody evolves from a position to a better position, I'll give them credit. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=389.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you think we should eliminate private health insurance? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  Because Kamala thinks that she wants Medicare for all, universal health care. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=398.88s)]
*  You know, you and I are getting a little bit older. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=404.6s)]
*  I'd actually like to keep my health care. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  She says we should eliminate private insurance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=411.12s)]
*  You support the Medicare for all bill, I think, initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=413.0s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor on it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=417.16s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=419.0s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=422.96s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=426.64s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=435.52s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=447.0s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=449.12s)]
*  I thought she and Walls were running as the Freedom Party. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=450.12s)]
*  I'd like the freedom to get my own health care. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=453.36s)]
*  And I think you'd probably like yours, too. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=455.24s)]
*  Well, I don't think we should eliminate private health care. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=457.24s)]
*  I never thought Medicare for all was a good idea. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  I disagree with it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=463.44s)]
*  Just like I disagree with Donald Trump, that people who serve in the armed forces are fools. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=464.44s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  I think medal-of-honor winners held a more steam-placed place in the United States than [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  people who won the Medal of Freedom. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=475.48s)]
*  So, you never get somebody that you're going to agree with on every point. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=477.28s)]
*  But what she has, her position has evolved. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=480.88s)]
*  So am I going to say that she was wrong four or five years ago? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=483.88s)]
*  Yeah, maybe she was. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=487.44s)]
*  And if she held the same position today, I would be happy to come on your show and say, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=488.84s)]
*  although I'm voting for Vice President Harris, I profoundly disagree with her position on [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=493.12s)]
*  private insurance, I do not think that is her current position. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=497.64s)]
*  And if you're going to vote for her, you're going to vote for her. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=506.88s)]
*  And if you're going to vote for her, you're going to vote for her. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV9F-N852o&t=509.88s)]
