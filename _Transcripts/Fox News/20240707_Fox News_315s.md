# Marsha Blackburn: Democrats are in a scramble
**Fox News:** [July 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. With Joe Biden's candidacy on the ropes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=0.0s)]
*  top Democrats are reportedly pivoting to Kamala Harris. CNN actually obtained a Google document [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  that was circulating among self-described top Democrats. You're looking at it. The [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=12.8s)]
*  document admits we are currently losing, like it or not. There's one realistic path out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=17.68s)]
*  of this mess, Kamala. And Kamala Harris knows the stakes are high. Tyler Page at the Washington [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=22.88s)]
*  Post reporting that the vice president concluded the meeting with governors by saying, this is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=28.6s)]
*  about saving our effing democracy. Well, if you believe that you'd be asking your boss to step [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=34.96s)]
*  aside. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is taking note as they prepare to take on the vice president [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=39.88s)]
*  if Biden steps aside. Here now with reaction, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. Senator [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=45.0s)]
*  Blackburn, you know, I'm reading some of the feedback that's coming in from Democratic aides [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=50.96s)]
*  and a senior Democratic aide said that when they watched the interview tonight, this was to the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  publication notice. It's making me feel better about Kamala. You worked with Kamala. She was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=60.48s)]
*  your Senate colleague. I'm wondering if you think she's up for the job. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, Taylor, I think what the Democrats have in front of them is a no win situation. They are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=71.8s)]
*  going to reap what they have sown. You've got the Democrats in the media that have covered up for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=77.32s)]
*  Joe Biden. And now they're in a scramble. Now we know Kamala Harris would be even worse on a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=83.08s)]
*  ticket. You can look at her record. She owns every failure of the Biden Harris administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=91.32s)]
*  She is the one that wanted to defund ICE. The border is the top issue. And look what that open [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=99.64s)]
*  border has done to our country. And Kamala, the borders are was supposed to go fix this issue. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  But instead you've got fentanyl, you've got sex trafficking, human trafficking, you've got gangs, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=112.84s)]
*  you've got crime. And this is the reason that women are now security moms. It is their number [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  one issue. You look at inflation and Kamala voted against the Trump tax cuts and people can't afford [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=126.36s)]
*  to buy a new car. They can't even afford to fill up the gas tank of the car they've got. They can't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=134.2s)]
*  fill up the gas tank and the grocery cart in the same week. And they're worried about what is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=140.2s)]
*  happening with the economy. And then when it comes to women, they have a terrible record. They're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=146.92s)]
*  trying to erase gender. They cannot give you the definition of the word woman. They are trying to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  put boys in girls' sports. And the Democrats now think Kamala is going to do a better job. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=159.32s)]
*  Because look at Biden-Harris. They have made life more difficult. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=168.04s)]
*  They have. You know, Mark Levin made the point to me earlier in the week that Kamala Harris was part [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=174.36s)]
*  of this cover-up, vouching for Biden over and over. So Mark Levin makes this point. And then [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=180.28s)]
*  the famed pollster Nate Silver says the only thing that could derail her is if she is found to be part [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=185.16s)]
*  of the cover-up. I've seen other reporters make this point. And I think it's important to take our [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=190.28s)]
*  viewers down memory lane. I want to play, this is Kamala reacting to the Robert Herr report that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=194.68s)]
*  said Biden was a well-meaning elderly old man unfit to stand trial. Let's roll it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=200.6s)]
*  — The comments that were made by that prosecutor, gratuitous, inaccurate, and inappropriate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=205.08s)]
*  October 7th, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=214.44s)]
*  Israel experienced a horrific attack. He was in front of it all, coordinating [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=215.88s)]
*  and directing leaders who are in charge of America's national security, not to mention [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=225.4s)]
*  our allies around the globe. So the way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=231.48s)]
*  could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=239.16s)]
*  — She misled us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=248.44s)]
*  — Oh yes, indeed she did. She lied about Joe Biden's record, about the mental acuity, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=251.88s)]
*  his abilities. She has lied to the American people. And the American people, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=258.44s)]
*  know they cannot trust her. She is more unpopular than Joe Biden. And the Democrats [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=264.84s)]
*  do not want Biden or Harris at the top of the ticket. And I, you know what, Kayleigh, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=270.11999999999995s)]
*  I am so pleased. I'm running for reelection with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  I know that other Republicans in the Senate and in the House are pleased that the president [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=284.52s)]
*  is at the top of the ticket. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yakzjv5H10&t=290.44s)]
