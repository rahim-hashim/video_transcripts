# Piers Morgan: This is why Trump is more popular than ever
**Fox News:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY)
*  And a column for The Sun said that Donald Trump is more popular than ever and likened [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=0.0s)]
*  his comeback to that of Frank Sinatra, citing Trump's resilience and humor as two major [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=5.38s)]
*  factors in his resurgence here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=10.98s)]
*  Anyway, joining us now to explain all of this, the host of Uncensored with Piers Morgan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=13.98s)]
*  There's no such thing as a censored Piers Morgan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  We should say this before—at the outset here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=23.18s)]
*  The morning you walked off the set of the number one morning show in Great Britain, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=26.2s)]
*  I wrote you, I said, whatever you do, don't quit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know if that message got to you or not, but— [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  No, it did. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=39.6s)]
*  But you know what, Sean? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=40.6s)]
*  They said to me, if you apologize to Meghan Markle for disbelieving her, then you can [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=41.6s)]
*  keep your job. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=47.84s)]
*  But the problem was, it would be like saying you're apologizing to Pinocchio for believing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Pinocchio. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=54.8s)]
*  So I decided on balance, better to walk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=55.9s)]
*  You know, it's funny because, you know, liberal Joe, as I call him, Scarborough, I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=58.9s)]
*  mean, he used to claim he's a conservative. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=64.34s)]
*  And it's like, you know, he just adopted this liberalism because he wants to be on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=67.06s)]
*  television. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=73.42s)]
*  He used to beg, you know, people here to please hire him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=74.42s)]
*  And he didn't like the place he was working at, so he figured, well, he's not going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  to get hired here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=79.62s)]
*  Might as well do that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=80.62s)]
*  Let's talk about what you see about Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=81.97999999999999s)]
*  You'd been critical of President Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=85.72s)]
*  I thought the speech he gave in Iowa was gracious. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=87.96s)]
*  I thought my last town hall with him, very measured, smart, funny. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=90.8s)]
*  We're seeing a little bit different side of him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=96.24s)]
*  Not talking as much about 2020 anymore. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=99.2s)]
*  And he's looking forward. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=101.16s)]
*  I think it's helpful. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=102.36s)]
*  Well, hallelujah to that last point, because when I last interviewed President Trump, I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=103.36s)]
*  did say to him, look, I just think you've got to move on from looking back to 2020 all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=109.12s)]
*  the time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=112.92s)]
*  You've got to present a vision for America going forward for 2024, and you can get reelected. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=113.98s)]
*  And I noticed that he's now stopped talking nearly so much about 2020. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  He's talking about 2024. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=124.22s)]
*  And he's showing all the best sides of Donald Trump, which you and I have always known have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=126.18s)]
*  been there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=130.38s)]
*  He's shown the charm. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=131.38s)]
*  He's shown the incredible resilience. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=132.9s)]
*  He really is the comeback kid. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  I would have said a year ago there was no chance he would have done what he did in Iowa. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=136.86s)]
*  He also is showing that humor, which seems to upset all the right people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=141.28s)]
*  I thought the hilarious line he did in Iowa when he said, even if it kills you, basically, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=145.92s)]
*  your vote will count. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=151.32s)]
*  The people taking that seriously are exactly the kind of people I can't stand. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=152.6s)]
*  By the way, he was even half-laughing when he said it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=156.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=158.68s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=159.68s)]
*  It was a joke. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=160.68s)]
*  So I think you put it all together. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=161.68s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump is not an angel, but nor is he a devil. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=162.68s)]
*  I've always respected his remarkable ability to withstand the kind of pressure that would [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=166.33999999999997s)]
*  knock off any other public figure I know. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=171.98s)]
*  You know, I remember talking to him many years ago about what happened in the financial crash [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=174.42s)]
*  of the mid-'90s, when all his friends went under pretty much. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=179.61999999999998s)]
*  And I said, how did you manage to keep going? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=183.06s)]
*  And he said, you know what? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=185.06s)]
*  I just had to not do what they were doing, which was running home to Mommy and crying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=186.06s)]
*  and saying, isn't life unfair? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  I dug down, I moved forward, and I carried through the storm. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=192.6s)]
*  And I remember that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=196.36s)]
*  And I've watched him do it again this year, when, as charge after charge after charge [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=197.36s)]
*  has come at him, he has got stronger and the polling for him has improved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=202.24s)]
*  Because even Republicans that don't really like Donald Trump can see that there is a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=207.84s)]
*  witch hunt element to all this, that the Democrats are trying to kill him off, but by doing so, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=212.0s)]
*  they're making him more popular. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=219.2s)]
*  And Donald Trump can feel that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=220.86s)]
*  And I watched him last night with you, Sean. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=222.46s)]
*  And I thought, I see a guy right on top of his game, absolutely determined to get back [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=224.06s)]
*  to the White House. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=229.9s)]
*  I think he's pretty much got the nomination in the bag. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=230.9s)]
*  I think he's going to win in New Hampshire and South Carolina quite comfortably. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=233.86s)]
*  I think this is all over, probably before Super Tuesday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  And then, honestly, who would put money right now on Donald Trump not beating Joe Biden, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=240.5s)]
*  when Joe Biden can barely string his centers together and can barely stand on his own two feet? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=245.66000000000003s)]
*  If it is Joe Biden, you said something that is key, and this is unique for both of us, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  is I've known Donald Trump almost 30 years, long before you ever contemplated a run for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  the presidency or getting involved in politics. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=261.68s)]
*  In real life, he is one of the funniest people you'll ever meet, one of the most generous, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=264.52s)]
*  gregarious, friendly, warm even, and interesting people you'll ever meet. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=270.64s)]
*  And loyal. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=278.64s)]
*  And extremely loyal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=280.14s)]
*  And he's like you like that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=281.14s)]
*  So when I left CNN, for example, you messaged me, and Donald Trump rang me and wrote to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=282.14s)]
*  me numerous times in the next few months. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  And I never forgot that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=290.62s)]
*  And you're the same. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=292.5s)]
*  And I think that loyalty is a big Trump card for him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=293.9s)]
*  Now, like I say, he's not perfect. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=297.26s)]
*  There are many things I've disagreed with Donald Trump about, and I've gone toe-to-toe [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=299.82s)]
*  with him about a few big issues. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=303.26s)]
*  So I'm not going to pretend for a moment that I think everything he does is right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  But I do think JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon got it right when he said if you try and demonize [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=308.62s)]
*  everyone that is currently voting for Donald Trump, A, you're demonizing maybe 100 million [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=313.96s)]
*  Americans. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=319.2s)]
*  But secondly, you don't understand why they're voting for him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=320.2s)]
*  Last election was basically a referendum on Trump, who had had a year of a global pandemic [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=323.44s)]
*  with all the catastrophic fallout. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  And Biden was able to hide in his bunker and exploit that and run as an anti-Trump candidate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=332.24s)]
*  This time around, if it is Trump-Biden, it will be a referendum on Joe Biden's presidency, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  which judging by his current approval ratings, is incredibly unpopular with the American [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=342.94s)]
*  public. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  Very, very different battle. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  And he doesn't have to change who he is. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=350.84s)]
*  That's the interesting part of this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=352.62s)]
*  Let Trump be Trump, and he is a fighter. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=354.4s)]
*  But Americans kind of need a fighter right now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  The world stage needs an American leader. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=359.14s)]
*  We see what's happening in Europe. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=361.9s)]
*  We see what's happening in the Middle East. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=363.17999999999995s)]
*  But the side of Donald Trump that we know that maybe it doesn't show as often, I think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=365.96s)]
*  it's to his benefit to also show that time. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's sincere. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not contrived. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  I think he's taking advice from you and other people, and I think he's got to pivot. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  No, he doesn't listen to me. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=380.76s)]
*  Well, I think he does, actually, more than probably that you get credit for. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=382.76s)]
*  But I do think that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=386.64s)]
*  And I, you know, he's frustrating Donald Trump, because people who like him—and I've [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=387.64s)]
*  known him a long time, and he's been very good to me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  People who like him are frustrated by him, because occasionally he will just do stuff, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=394.18s)]
*  and he'd go, come on, don't do that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93LGPDIjRY&t=397.14000000000004s)]
