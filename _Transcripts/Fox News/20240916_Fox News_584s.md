# Trump’s golf partner: 'Thank God' he wasn’t killed
**Fox News:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU)
*  All right, joining us now to share his story, he's an incredible developer, friend and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=0.0s)]
*  also businessman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=5.64s)]
*  Steve Witkoff is with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=7.44s)]
*  Steve, great to see you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=10.64s)]
*  When I met you for breakfast yesterday, I didn't think you'd be on this TV show today, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=12.52s)]
*  and I didn't think you'd go through everything you went through yesterday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=17.96s)]
*  I'm glad you're OK. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=20.72s)]
*  I'm glad the president is OK. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=21.84s)]
*  Why don't you tell this audience everything that happened? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, Sean, thanks for having me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=27.8s)]
*  Yesterday was quite a day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=34.2s)]
*  I actually feel blessed that I was there yesterday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=38.56s)]
*  And the reason I feel blessed, Sean, is that I got to see what it's like for my dear friend [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=43.44s)]
*  to live his normal life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=48.2s)]
*  His normal life, which is punctuated by two attempts to assassinate him in the last six [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=50.72s)]
*  days, being vilified since he left the presidency, falsely accused, harassed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  To me, he gave four years of his best years to public service. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=66.92s)]
*  He ought to be commended for the job that he did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=72.36s)]
*  And yet here he was yesterday on a beautiful day just trying to get some rest and relaxation, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  like all the rest of us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=81.84s)]
*  And there's a man with a machine gun, an assault rifle, who's attempting to kill him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  But I got to see a man who was stoic, courageous, cared about his friend's safety first before [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=94.72s)]
*  his own life. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=105.72s)]
*  He was an inspiration to everybody who was around him yesterday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I wish the whole country could have witnessed what happened yesterday, because they would [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=111.76s)]
*  have seen a real leader. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=115.36s)]
*  Okay, so you're walking up to the green, and you're looking to putt. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=117.56s)]
*  All of a sudden you hear the gunshots. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=126.76s)]
*  What did it sound like? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=128.92s)]
*  Did you know immediately there were gunshots? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=129.92s)]
*  Did you know the direction they came from? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=131.16s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=134.36s)]
*  I'm a gun carrier. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=136.16s)]
*  And I've been a gun carrier for 35 years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  So, it was, you knew immediately it was gunfire. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  It didn't sound like firecrackers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=146.8s)]
*  The Secret Service were exceptional. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  They were on, they were, they had the president secured, in my estimation, because I was five [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=151.24s)]
*  yards away from him, in my estimation, maybe after the first shot. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=157.4s)]
*  Certainly after the second shot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  So by the time the fourth shot rang out, the president was on his way with that detail. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=164.56s)]
*  It was as if they had practiced it 500 times before. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  It was, it was pretty awesome to watch them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  And they were heroic because their lives were on the line. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=180.2s)]
*  They were exposed at that moment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  The sniper teams deployed right next to me, maybe a yard or two away, with their tripods, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=186.48s)]
*  aiming at the tree line. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  We saw the Secret Service, other detail members converging with golf carts on that area where [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=194.72s)]
*  clearly the shots had come from. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=200.44s)]
*  And the president was safe, thank God. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=204.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=207.84s)]
*  So the Secret Service around you, and I agree based on everything you told me, they were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=209.0s)]
*  phenomenal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=214.68s)]
*  They, within seconds, within a second or two, they were on the president, they got him off [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=216.4s)]
*  the golf course immediately. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=221.72s)]
*  You told me that you stood up the whole time, you never sat down. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=223.6s)]
*  And then you talked about other Secret Service, they had their tripods, there were snipers, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=228.2s)]
*  but they were in an open field, they were on a golf course, they were sitting ducks [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=234.0s)]
*  themselves, but they put their lives at risk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=237.44s)]
*  So everybody around the president at that moment, I mean, I don't have enough adjectives [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=240.04s)]
*  to describe the level of heroism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=246.8s)]
*  That's what you're describing, rightly to us, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=248.88s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=253.4s)]
*  They were, each and every one of them, each and every one of them put themselves in harm's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=254.4s)]
*  way to put themselves in between the shooter and the president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=258.16s)]
*  I was standing up, as I said, to this day, to this minute, I don't know why I continue [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=264.36s)]
*  to stand. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=269.56s)]
*  I think it maybe has something to do with just by osmosis being around my friend. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=271.52s)]
*  He's so courageous that it, you know, you feel inspired that you want to demonstrate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  a little bit of that yourself, if you can. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=283.0s)]
*  But they put themselves between that shooter and the president. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=285.6s)]
*  And there's no mistaking that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=295.52s)]
*  I watched it all happen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=297.24s)]
*  Let me ask you this question, and I'll get into this more. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=300.86s)]
*  I had a conversation with Eric and Laura Trump yesterday, and Eric's coming on after you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=304.48s)]
*  The only problem I have, the area is close to a street called Congress Avenue. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's between Congress Avenue, it is the part of the golf course that is closest to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=316.72s)]
*  that street, and between the street and the golf course is a treat area and a fence. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=322.32s)]
*  This is where the would-be assassin was hiding. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=328.52s)]
*  And what frustrates me, that is 300-plus yards or so from where you were, from where the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=334.24s)]
*  president was, that area apparently was never checked. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  And I'm having a hard time understanding why, from a security standpoint, nobody checked [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=345.56s)]
*  that area on that street and checked that wooded area when the president is within that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=351.44s)]
*  tight range. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=357.56s)]
*  And in this case, with somebody that ends up having an AK-47 with a scope on it, that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=359.44s)]
*  is the failure part to me, and I am not negating all the heroism that you witnessed yesterday. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=365.04s)]
*  Well, you know, Sean, I mean, I wasn't out on the periphery, but as I understand it, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=376.24s)]
*  there was an agent who was on the outside fence line between Congress Avenue and the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=383.04s)]
*  fence or tree line, and he had checked that area and just missed the shooter, the assassin. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=389.44s)]
*  And then as it was supposed to happen, there's an advance man, and this is every time I play [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=398.74s)]
*  with the president and I play with him quite a bit, there's an advance person who is going [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=405.56s)]
*  in front of us, scanning the area of the next hole or any vulnerable areas, and it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=411.18s)]
*  worked as it should. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=418.58s)]
*  He actually looked towards that tree line. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=420.5s)]
*  By the way, you've got to look pretty closely. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=423.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a gun barrel, it's not so easy to see inside of those trees. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, that part was amazing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=433.18s)]
*  And this guy engaged. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=434.18s)]
*  And it's nothing short of incredible. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=436.1s)]
*  If that guy didn't see that gun barrel, we'd be talking about a funeral in all likelihood [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  today. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=447.3s)]
*  That's how close President Trump, again, came to be assassinated. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=448.3s)]
*  My question is a little bit different. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=453.94s)]
*  I would think that the proper procedure would be make sure clear that wooded area and make [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=456.14000000000004s)]
*  sure it's checked, and at that point, make sure that you have enough agents to keep their [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=462.06s)]
*  eyes and make sure that nobody goes back into that wooded area. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=468.14s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=471.54s)]
*  No, of course it does. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=473.54s)]
*  And look, that goes to manpower. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=476.3s)]
*  And you have people who were interviewed in the last day, including the Palm Beach sheriff, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=478.74s)]
*  who said that the president did not get the full compliment of a detail as if a sitting [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=483.86s)]
*  president would have been out there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=489.94s)]
*  So I'm not the expert. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=491.98s)]
*  I can't tell you that the full compliment would have made a difference yesterday. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=494.41999999999996s)]
*  I only know this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=499.97999999999996s)]
*  I have a little love thing for my dear friend. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=501.7s)]
*  And I say to myself, thank God that he was not injured or killed. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  And thank God none of the other people. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=517.18s)]
*  There were plenty of civilians, by the way, staffers from his office, people who care [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=519.54s)]
*  about him just as much as I do, two other friends of his. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  So there could have been a lot of really serious damage out there, and there wasn't. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=528.1s)]
*  And I'm grateful to that agent who interdicted and that entire team. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=533.62s)]
*  I'm grateful for all of the heroism you're describing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IR6shJV7HU&t=538.86s)]
