# This is ‘terrible news’ for Biden: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw)
*  All right, so as Joe Biden's poll numbers continue plummeting, even the New York Times, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=0.0s)]
*  they can't hide how bad things are looking for Joe ahead of 24. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  And that means November 5th, a new poll by Times and Siena College asked voters if they [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=11.4s)]
*  generally remember the time that Donald Trump and Joe Biden were each president as mostly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=16.8s)]
*  good or mostly bad years for America. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=22.48s)]
*  42 percent of voters say they remember the Trump presidency as mostly good. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Look at this part. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=29.84s)]
*  Only 25 percent can say the same thing about Joe Biden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=31.2s)]
*  Forty-six percent, almost half of voters, say the Biden presidency has been mostly bad [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=34.68s)]
*  for America. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=41.12s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway, former White House chief of staff, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Reince Priebus. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=46.8s)]
*  Kellyanne, you're the pollster. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=47.8s)]
*  Add that to the demographic shift and the loss of the base that Joe is experiencing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  of his coalition. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=55.96s)]
*  Not good for him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=57.64s)]
*  Oh, it's terrible news. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=59.44s)]
*  Poll after poll by any outlet basically says the same thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=61.76s)]
*  What's important about the question you just showed, Sean, is the way that polling question [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=65.0s)]
*  is framed is precisely the way the question is framed by the voter, as he or she goes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=69.2s)]
*  into November. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=74.24s)]
*  They're basically saying it's a binary choice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  I can judge both Biden and Trump as presidents who have had a record on inflation, on the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  border, on crime, on Ukraine, on the Middle East, on anything they want to examine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=82.48s)]
*  They're going to compare that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=87.27999999999999s)]
*  That's a 30-point differential. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=89.27999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is negative 21, 25 mostly good, 42 mostly bad, 46 mostly bad. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=91.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is plus nine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=98.52s)]
*  It's a 30-point differential. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=99.96s)]
*  And it's also reflected in the swing state polls. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=101.96s)]
*  What this says to me as a pollster is voters are mostly nostalgic about, hungry for, and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  poised to vote and support the Donald Trump presidency again this fall. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  I think Trump 2024 is the best of 2016. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=116.44s)]
*  Reince and I were there, the hunger, the swagger, the underestimated Donald Trump, with that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=119.68s)]
*  four-year record as president. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=124.8s)]
*  And people—you know, the Democrats are going to overplay it on abortion on January 6, 2021. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=127.6s)]
*  We've had January 6, 2022, 23, 24 since then, and voters are saying every single January [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=134.4s)]
*  since then, I've been less prosperous, less safe, more nervous, and things just seem more [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=141.8s)]
*  chaotic, more crisis-ridden and less fair to me and my family. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=147.68s)]
*  And now Reince on trial. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  I've been saying that Trump has now divide—basically defied all conventional political gravity [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=154.24s)]
*  up to this point. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  They arrest him as poll numbers go up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=163.36s)]
*  Is that going to happen when they try him? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Joe certainly can't run it on the question of whether you're better off than you are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  four years ago with a straight face. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=170.6s)]
*  So January 6 is abortion, democracy in peril, and Republicans are racist, sexist, et cetera. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=173.0s)]
*  Will that work in this economic environment? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=181.2s)]
*  Will that work with the world basically on fire in large part because he's abdicated [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=184.12s)]
*  America's role on the world stage? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=189.2s)]
*  Well, definitely not in this case. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=191.52s)]
*  You know, interesting, speaking of these polls, on your question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  The media hasn't taken notice of one thing, even though we've been talking about it quite [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  a bit, but the mainstream media, I mean, the issue of democracy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they've spent years talking about the fact that Donald Trump is a threat to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=209.8s)]
*  democracy, yet in all these polls, both—Biden is either worse than Trump on this issue or [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=214.68s)]
*  they're tied. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=223.56s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=224.56s)]
*  They're tied because there's actually half the country that sees disqualification through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  litigation as bad. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=231.0s)]
*  They see a border that has no—you know, that's an open floodgate is bad. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=232.68s)]
*  They see sanctuary cities as bad. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=238.12s)]
*  They see 87,000 IRS agents as bad. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=240.36s)]
*  Lawlessness in the streets are bad. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=244.04s)]
*  Right now, 26 percent of the American people aren't even paying attention to these cases. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=246.96s)]
*  But if they are, the one line that—and President Trump, when he walked out of the courtroom [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=252.04s)]
*  today and I watched it a couple times—the thing that he said that's the most obvious [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=257.28s)]
*  and speaks to those 26 percent of the people that are paying attention is he said, we've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=263.08s)]
*  got lawlessness and crime outside of this courtroom and we've got 14 prosecutors inside [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=269.6s)]
*  the courtroom. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=276.2s)]
*  And the American people pay attention to that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=277.44s)]
*  So I think that this is not the case. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=279.6s)]
*  This is not the case. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=283.0s)]
*  And if I could bet on draft kings and acquittal was a choice, I'd probably take that bet. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=284.0s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=290.48s)]
*  203 days to go. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=292.6s)]
*  Perfect time to start a trial from eight years ago when the statute of limitations passed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll continue straight ahead. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=299.88s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJ2ArEuGlw&t=309.56s)]
