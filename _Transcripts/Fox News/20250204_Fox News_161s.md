# Sen. Katie Britt: ‘Peace through strength is back!’
**Fox News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM)
*  All right, here with reaction Alabama Senator Katie Britt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, let's get your take on Gitmo, but more importantly, what about El Salvador's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=3.24s)]
*  offer? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=8.08s)]
*  Look, I mean, this is an exciting day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=9.08s)]
*  Peace through strength is back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=11.64s)]
*  It's nice to have a commander-in-chief and a secretary of state that's willing to put [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=12.92s)]
*  America first. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=16.84s)]
*  It's remarkable that you had an administration that wasn't even willing to ask the world [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=18.12s)]
*  to take their criminals back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=22.16s)]
*  And yet you have this administration who is saying, enough is enough. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I was signing the Lake and Riley Act last week saying we're going to get criminals off of our streets. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=28.6s)]
*  We're going to detain them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=32.4s)]
*  Now we hear this week we are going to deport them to Gitmo. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=33.96s)]
*  You have Joe Biden, who had an open border system and drained Gitmo, actually emptying it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=37.08s)]
*  And now you have President Trump, who has closed borders and is saying, I'm going to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=43.28s)]
*  fill it up with the worst of the worst. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=47.44s)]
*  It is an exciting day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=49.64s)]
*  And this is what strength looks like. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=50.88s)]
*  This is what winning looks like. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=52.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=54.32s)]
*  All right, let's talk about your colleagues in the U.S. Senate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=55.44s)]
*  So Elon Musk exposes all this waste, fraud and abuse, and U.S. aid, and insane amounts [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=60.24s)]
*  of money, billions and billions of dollars, and they hate him and they hate President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=67.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=71.32s)]
*  How do they justify—how do they claim it's a constitutional crisis when nobody in America—and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=73.0s)]
*  I follow the news as closely as anybody—knew that the money was being spent this way? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=79.88s)]
*  Sean, you're exactly right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=85.16s)]
*  I mean, this is remarkable in all of the wrong ways. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  When you're scrolling that list, I mean, are you not shaking your head as you're reading [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=91.0s)]
*  it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=94.8s)]
*  And you think about this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=95.8s)]
*  These Democrats are out having an actual meltdown, a four-year-old meltdown, not over dollars [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=96.8s)]
*  that they believe should be going to our veterans who have served this country honorably, not [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=102.12s)]
*  for dollars that they believe should be helping a single mom get on their feet, not for dollars [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=106.52s)]
*  that they believe should be securing our border and keeping Americans safe and secure. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=110.56s)]
*  But they are crying over these dollars. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=114.32s)]
*  These aren't even to secure our allies or friends. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=117.56s)]
*  These are going for liberal, woke ideology, infiltrating that in countries all around [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=120.4s)]
*  the globe. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=126.16s)]
*  And Sean, let it not be lost on anybody. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=127.16s)]
*  These are American taxpayer dollars, hard-earned taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=130.04s)]
*  Americans deserve transparency. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=135.48s)]
*  And when Donald Trump ran, he said, that's exactly what you're going to get. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=141.6s)]
*  We're seeing it time and time again. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=143.16s)]
*  It is a new day and it is a good day for Americans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=144.62s)]
*  All right, Senator, good to see you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=147.28s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=149.32s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=150.32s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvXSgJzyHM&t=151.32s)]
