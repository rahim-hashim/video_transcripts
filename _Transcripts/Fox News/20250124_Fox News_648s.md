# 'Failure is not an option,' House GOP leaders say
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=0.0s)]
*  We are broadcasting live. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=6.44s)]
*  We are in our nation's capital. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=7.58s)]
*  President Trump has laid out an ambitious agenda for a second term. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=9.84s)]
*  Now planning to tackle the border crisis, economic ruin, countless other disasters that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=13.38s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris left behind. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=18.06s)]
*  How does Congress plan on enacting Trump's agenda? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=20.62s)]
*  Here to weigh in, we continue with Speaker Johnson joined by House Majority Leader Steve [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=24.02s)]
*  Scalise, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McLean. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=28.46s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=34.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=35.02s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=36.02s)]
*  How are you all? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=37.02s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=38.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=39.02s)]
*  So nobody's going to get everything they want, Steve. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=40.02s)]
*  We've been friends a long time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=41.42s)]
*  Do we agree on the fundamentals? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  In other words, you all win together, the country wins together, or we all lose together. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=46.14s)]
*  There's no in-between. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=51.74s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=52.74s)]
*  And in fact, you can see President Trump's focus is so much sharper. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=53.74s)]
*  He really recognizes, you know, he was spared by God to get to this moment, and we have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=57.74s)]
*  unified government. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=63.06s)]
*  We have an opportunity that you don't get often. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=64.06s)]
*  We've got to make this work. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=66.54s)]
*  And if you do, and we're talking about the same things, by the way, we're all talking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=67.98s)]
*  about lowering energy costs, getting rules and regulations under control, securing America's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=71.68s)]
*  border, making sure we don't have a tax increase so we can get our economy moving again and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=76.7s)]
*  lower inflation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=80.8s)]
*  Those are all things we talked about during the campaign. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=81.94s)]
*  President Trump talked about them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=84.42s)]
*  We talked about them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=85.7s)]
*  So there is no daylight between us and President Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, and if you go back to 2017, there was a little bit of a difference between the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  president and Congress. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=93.62s)]
*  You don't see that today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=94.86s)]
*  We're in sync. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=95.86s)]
*  We're moving together. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=96.86s)]
*  We had a great meeting at the White House today with President Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=98.04s)]
*  And he's ready to go, and we're ready to go to deliver on that agenda. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, you were there for three hours today, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=103.9s)]
*  And you had a meeting just you and Majority Leader Thune and the president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=106.1s)]
*  Then you brought in the leadership. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=111.38s)]
*  How did that go today? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=112.38s)]
*  It was great. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=113.38s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance was there as well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=114.86s)]
*  We talked about the agenda. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=116.58s)]
*  We talked about the importance of unity and how we're all energized to get this agenda [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=117.78s)]
*  done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  And the president's excited. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=122.33999999999999s)]
*  We can really see and feel the energy that the American people feel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=123.34s)]
*  I mean, something has changed in Washington, and we had to bring America back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  President Trump represents that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=131.42s)]
*  He's a symbol of that to people around the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=132.42s)]
*  A strong America again. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  It's good for us and it's good for everybody, all freedom-loving people around the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  And you're going to see a sea change like that around the globe. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  How big part of your job is going to be to keep everybody together? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=143.34s)]
*  How do you plan to make that work? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, the same way we did it last time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  The last two years, we had 222 members. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=150.58s)]
*  Everybody wants to focus on the fact that it's a small majority. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  Sean, it's a majority. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=157.9s)]
*  We have the majority. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=160.34s)]
*  And what I want to point out is that with 222, 221, and many times during the last Congress, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=162.22000000000003s)]
*  with less than that, because members have lives outside of here and they got to deal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=168.22000000000003s)]
*  with illnesses and different things, we did it with less numbers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=172.1s)]
*  This group, the beauty of the Republican Party and these members, these men and women who [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=175.82s)]
*  have been sent here, they're fighting for their districts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  And sometimes it doesn't look pretty because they're going to have disagreements, et cetera. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  But I'm here to tell you, under Mike's leadership and this whole group, we're going to get the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=187.74s)]
*  job done at the end of the day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=192.34s)]
*  Failure is not an option. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  So I appreciate that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  I'll get back to you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=199.06s)]
*  The House and Senate have very different rules. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=202.06s)]
*  In the Senate reconciliation, you have to meet a lot of criteria to get that through. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=206.5s)]
*  That means there's got to be a lot of coordination between you and the majority leader to get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  the language right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=217.86s)]
*  Does that hurt your ability to get it through the House? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=219.06s)]
*  You want one bill. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=221.58s)]
*  I know that a lot of senators, when they met with Donald Trump, they will push him very [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=223.06s)]
*  hard for two bills. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=227.06s)]
*  I don't care if it's one bill or two bills as long as you get it done quickly, especially [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  on the economy, because that will impact all of you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  If you all want to be reelected, the economy better be in better shape. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=235.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=238.77999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, there's more Republicans in the majority in the Senate than there are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=239.77999999999997s)]
*  in the House for the first time in a long time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=242.27999999999997s)]
*  So we have a more complicated equation to work out here and a smaller margin, but we [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=243.98s)]
*  will get it done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=248.22s)]
*  Reconciliation is the mechanism that allows us to do this in a partisan way so that it's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  Republican priorities that we squeeze into this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=254.73999999999998s)]
*  The reason the president talked about the One Big Beautiful bill and we talk about it [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=257.06s)]
*  as well is because that's the most efficient and effective way to get it done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=260.5s)]
*  And if we stay on the aggressive timetable that we're on right now, we've been working [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=263.66s)]
*  on this for almost a year preparing for this moment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=266.9s)]
*  If you pass that One Big Beautiful bill, you pass it in the House, it gets sent over to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=268.7s)]
*  the Senate, what do you think happens there? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=273.38s)]
*  I think we get it done by the end of April or certainly by Memorial Day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=275.58s)]
*  Will the Senate, will they mark it up and you go into conference or will they try to, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=280.06s)]
*  you know, separate it into two bills? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=284.46s)]
*  Well, if we're going to go for speed, we have to be closely coordinated, both chambers, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  and we are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think the House Republicans and Senate Republicans are working as closely [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  now probably maybe that they ever have. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  And the reason we were at the White House today to begin the first day, I mean, they're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  literally, you know, they're unpacking boxes at the Oval Office today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=299.70000000000005s)]
*  And the president hosted us because we don't have any time to waste and it's serious business. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=302.98s)]
*  And it was a great meeting. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=306.54s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of cooperation right now and we're going to continue that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=308.66s)]
*  He's been working, I lived out in Florida and I can tell you, because I talk to people [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=311.42s)]
*  around him and I talk to him, the guy does not stop working. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=316.06s)]
*  No, never does he sleep, John. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't stop talking or working. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=321.58s)]
*  I have talked to him every hour on the 24-hour day clock. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=323.42s)]
*  Congresswoman, congratulations to you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=326.74s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=329.9s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts on one bill, two bills, does it matter, how quickly, and how do you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=330.9s)]
*  keep a small margin together? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=337.06s)]
*  Well, I think the beauty is we all agree at the same principle. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=339.26s)]
*  We have to deliver to what for the American people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=343.3s)]
*  They sent us a mandate, as Speaker Johnson said, and it's our job to fulfill that mandate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  and we will fulfill that mandate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  I think right now we're sitting at one bill, but at the end of the day, the American people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  and President Trump, we care about getting results. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=359.26s)]
*  That is more important than anything. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=363.7s)]
*  And President Trump has been very clear on that is this is the result I want. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=366.14s)]
*  We prefer one bill in the House. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  We've been clear about that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=373.5s)]
*  And I think as we stand right now, we're going to put one bill on the floor and we'll be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  very successful doing it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=378.94s)]
*  Let me ask all four of you the same question. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=380.42s)]
*  Republican Party, all the years I've been in talk radio, believe it or not, I started [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=383.66s)]
*  before Speaker Johnson was born in 1987. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  And we've talked about limited government and greater freedom. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=392.66s)]
*  You talk about eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=397.04s)]
*  Every year it comes up. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=401.36s)]
*  It never happens. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=402.72s)]
*  And if you reduce the rate of increase, they call it a cut and you're stealing from grandma [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  and grandpa and you want them to eat dog food and cat food and die and some Republican lookalike [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  is going to push him off a cliff. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  Now you have something called Doge. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, the new department, government efficiency, Elon Musk, smart guy, he believes he can cut [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=419.24s)]
*  $2 trillion. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=425.94s)]
*  And my question for everybody in this room, are you ready to really cut, reduce the size [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=427.78s)]
*  of government by $2 trillion so that we stop robbing from our children and our grandchildren? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=434.02s)]
*  Is this the party of limited government? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=440.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=442.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=443.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=444.54s)]
*  And when you're going to cut the farm budget and then you're going to cut the Department [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=445.54s)]
*  of Education and block grant money to the states at a lower rate, you're willing to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=455.7s)]
*  take that stand and risk reelection? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=461.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, because it's going to do right by the American people and they will see the results [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  of that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we are the party of limited government. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=468.53999999999996s)]
*  We want to scale down the size and scope of government. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  It's too big. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=471.9s)]
*  It does too many things. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=472.9s)]
*  It does almost nothing well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=473.9s)]
*  And Elon is coming to recognize that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=474.9s)]
*  But we've been talking about this for a long, long time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=477.02s)]
*  And we have pages and pages of cuts that we're prepared to engage in. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=479.8s)]
*  We're working on the consensus so that every district and every Republican gets on board [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=483.42s)]
*  with that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=486.9s)]
*  And we're going to deliver. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=487.9s)]
*  Think of all the slush funds, Sean. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=488.9s)]
*  You know, the Inflation Reduction Act that created the inflation that we see because [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=489.9s)]
*  it was trillions of new spending. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=493.3s)]
*  The EV mandate. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=495.46s)]
*  People don't want to buy the cars. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=496.78s)]
*  You get $7,500 that somebody who's driving a pickup truck has to give to somebody who [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=498.06s)]
*  wants to go buy an electric vehicle. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=503.02s)]
*  You can't even find a charging station for the thing. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=504.98s)]
*  There's billions of dollars sitting in a slush fund that we're going to go take back and give [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=507.46s)]
*  to the taxpayer of America. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=511.26s)]
*  Get rid of those things altogether. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  So it's not just about reducing spending. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=514.18s)]
*  It's about getting rid of some of this waste that's out there in government. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=516.1s)]
*  We're going to do that in the reconciliation bill. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=519.14s)]
*  Why would we make Ford lose $4.5 billion to make cars that their customers don't want? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=520.98s)]
*  When you have Tesla, if you want an automobile, I'm pro-choice in this sense. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=529.02s)]
*  You want an electric, you want a hybrid, you want a gas-powered vehicle, have at it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=533.04s)]
*  I'm not buying your global warming crap when you're flying around the country in the world [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=537.06s)]
*  in your private jet. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=541.26s)]
*  Thank you for the lectures. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=542.74s)]
*  We don't need it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=543.74s)]
*  And let the free market determine that, Congressman. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=545.62s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=547.9s)]
*  And back to your question about you got Doge, everything else. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=548.9s)]
*  Would it surprise you, Sean, because it doesn't get reported. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=552.86s)]
*  The men and women that make up the Republican Conference here in the U.S. House of Representatives, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=555.9s)]
*  this is what they came for. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=561.0s)]
*  They came to solve the deficit that we run on an annual basis of $1.7 to $2 trillion. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=562.48s)]
*  They came to get the balanced budget and then start to pay off the debt so our kids [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=568.46s)]
*  aren't saddled with our excess. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  The beauty of President Trump is he comes to this presidency with some unconventional, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=576.94s)]
*  out-of-the-box thinking and ideas. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=582.98s)]
*  That's very different than what we've seen under the previous administration. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=586.82s)]
*  And I think it's going to take unconventional thoughts and policies to get us out of the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=590.14s)]
*  situation that we're in right now. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=595.78s)]
*  And that's what we're excited about. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=598.3s)]
*  I think this Congress, if you enact this Trump agenda, everyone watching in this audience [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=599.3s)]
*  knows what it is, you can be the most transformational Congress in history. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=604.06s)]
*  We've not balanced the budget since Newt Gingrich was speaker. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=609.1s)]
*  I did it five times. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=611.6999999999999s)]
*  We'll take a break. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=614.26s)]
*  Good to see you all. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=615.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=616.38s)]
*  When we come back, the one and only, he's even wearing a jacket tonight. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=617.38s)]
*  Jim Jordan, James Comer, straight ahead. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  We'll also talk about the last minute pardons of Joe Biden, that and more as we continue. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=624.18s)]
*  We're live in our nation's Capitol. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYa5CCq-se4&t=630.02s)]
