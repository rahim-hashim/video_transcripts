# Benjamin Netanyahu: We're comporting with the laws of war and intend to complete the job
**Fox News:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE)
*  Earlier this week, Sean spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=0.0s)]
*  They discussed anti-Semitism on college campuses, the Biden administration's tepid support [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=5.08s)]
*  of Israel, and so much more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=9.48s)]
*  Here's part two of their conversation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=11.6s)]
*  I've made the statement over and over again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=15.08s)]
*  When congressional appropriations were made to help Israel out in your war on terror, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=19.0s)]
*  then came conditions from the Biden administration and a pressure campaign for you not to finish [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=24.56s)]
*  the battle, the war that they started against you, and not to go into Rafa, where the aid [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=31.52s)]
*  would be withheld. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=36.48s)]
*  The term I used on this show right here is that Joe Biden surrendered in the war against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=38.36s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=43.76s)]
*  I stand by that today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=45.72s)]
*  I don't think he should be telling you how to fight your war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=47.4s)]
*  I think what America's message to you should be is what Israel's message was to us after [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=50.64s)]
*  9-11. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=55.44s)]
*  Go win your war against terror, because you hear death to Israel, death to America. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  It's not just Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=62.96s)]
*  They want death to the free world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=64.68s)]
*  So I really was very disappointed in President Biden. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Probably not something you want to get too deeply into. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=71.08s)]
*  Well, look, I appreciate the fact that President Biden came to us at the beginning of the war, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=73.68s)]
*  and the help that he gave us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=80.48s)]
*  But obviously, we have a disagreement on Rafa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  And I said, look, Rafa is where four of the 24 terrorist battalions of the Hamas terrorist [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  army are there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  We can't leave them there, any more than the allies could leave 20 percent of the Nazi [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=92.12s)]
*  army intact in Germany with their own territory, and don't go into Berlin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=96.24s)]
*  If somebody said to you, leave 20 percent of the Nazi army, don't go into Berlin, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=101.8s)]
*  that would be unacceptable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=105.32s)]
*  It's unacceptable to us, too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=106.32s)]
*  So we're going in there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=108.52s)]
*  We're trying to reach an understanding with the administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=109.6s)]
*  I hope we do, but we'll do what we need to do, what we must do, to make sure that Hamas [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=112.2s)]
*  doesn't retake Gaza and do what they promised to do, and that is to repeat the horrible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=118.0s)]
*  October 7 massacre, the beheading of women after they raped them, the burning of babies, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  the slaughter of the innocent, the taking of hostages, women, children, you name it, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=129.24s)]
*  Holocaust survivors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=134.8s)]
*  We're not going to let them do it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=135.8s)]
*  So I hope we can reach an understanding, but we'll do what we must do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=137.56s)]
*  And let me tell you, I think there is vast support in Israel for the position that I'm [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=140.76s)]
*  talking about, and there's also vast support in the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=146.0s)]
*  I've seen this in the numbers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=149.48s)]
*  Eighty percent of Americans, 80 percent of Americans, when asked, who do you support, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  Israel or Hamas? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=156.2s)]
*  Eighty percent say they support Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=157.2s)]
*  Twenty percent say they support Hamas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=159.84s)]
*  That's the same 20 percent who say that Bin Laden was right and America was wrong. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=162.44s)]
*  So there's something deeply wrong with that fringe, but it's a fringe. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=167.16s)]
*  And you can see that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=170.94s)]
*  You know, these people, people instinctively understand that we're fighting your fight, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=171.94s)]
*  that by—we're sort of standing in Hamas in Iran's way, Iran with all its henchmen, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=176.4s)]
*  Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, they want to conquer the Middle East, and they want to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=182.88s)]
*  threaten you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=186.8s)]
*  They want to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear weapons to threaten [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=187.8s)]
*  you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=192.56s)]
*  Yes, you, Sean, where you're sitting, and every city in the United States. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=193.56s)]
*  Israel stands in their way. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  So for them, we are you and you are us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  On this, they're right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know where I saw that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  I saw that in the mobs and American—you know, these vocal, violent crowds in American [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  universities. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=211.68s)]
*  I mean— [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=212.68s)]
*  Parable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=213.68s)]
*  Yeah, what do they do? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=214.68s)]
*  Parable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=215.68s)]
*  They burn flags, and they burn American flags. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  They chant, Death to Israel, Death to America. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=218.12s)]
*  They don't hate America because of Israel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=221.44s)]
*  They hate Israel because of America, because we're part and parcel of this common civilization [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=224.12s)]
*  of ours with our common values. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=228.52s)]
*  And the most moving thing that I saw was in the University of North Carolina the other [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=231.16s)]
*  day, because the Palestinian supporters, they burnt an American flag, an Israeli flag. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=235.16s)]
*  Then they took down an American flag from the flagpole and hoisted a Palestinian flag. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=242.12s)]
*  And these frat brothers came, took down the Palestinian flag, re-hoisted the American [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=246.76s)]
*  flag and then stood around the American flagpole to protect it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=252.56s)]
*  And they got a million bucks in crowdfunding. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=258.42s)]
*  You know, it tells you where the American people are. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=261.14s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=263.08s)]
*  They understand that our war—our war is your war. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=264.08s)]
*  Our victory will be your victory. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=267.58s)]
*  I think that the vast majority of Americans understand it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=269.44s)]
*  And by the way, the vast majority of Israelis understand it, and that's why they support [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=273.24s)]
*  my goal of total victory over Hamas, releasing all our hostages and making sure that Gaza [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=276.8s)]
*  doesn't pose a threat to Israel in the future. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=283.12s)]
*  What has our aim, Winston Churchill, said? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=286.66s)]
*  I can tell you in one word, victory. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=288.48s)]
*  And then he expanded. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Victory against the monstrous tyranny. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=292.68s)]
*  Well, let me— [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=294.16s)]
*  Let me— [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=295.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=296.16s)]
*  I was going to say that no hit job and no absurdity and no perversion of justice and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  travesty of international law will make us not achieve these goals. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  And I appreciate the support we've been receiving from the American people over the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=308.12s)]
*  years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  We had—I deeply appreciate the support that President Trump gave us over his administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=320.8s)]
*  He moved the American embassy there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=323.6s)]
*  He recognized our sovereignty in the Golan Heights. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=325.44s)]
*  He got out of the disastrous Iran deal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  And I also appreciate the support we got from President Biden and his administration, even [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=331.28s)]
*  though we have our differences occasionally. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=335.32s)]
*  I think, by and large, what you see is that the vast majority of the American people across [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=337.56s)]
*  the political spectrum, not including the extreme fringes on the progressive side, really [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=342.76s)]
*  Understand our battle, which is your battle, and understand our values, which are your [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  values, and they're not going to be hoodwinked by this kangaroo prosecutor in The Hague. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=355.88s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question, and I know you have to run, sir. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=361.88s)]
*  There is a tape, there's about a 50-minute tape that the IDF has put together, and on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=366.84s)]
*  October 7th, the Hamas terrorists that were killing and raping and beheading and murdering [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=373.24s)]
*  innocent citizens in your country, it's all on tape. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  It—I mean, literally, it was as reminiscent as Nazi Germany. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=385.0s)]
*  And I don't use that analogy lightly as anything I've ever seen in my lifetime. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, there is a way—I don't think most people have seen it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=397.56s)]
*  I do believe if people saw it, it would change the opinion of many people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=401.96s)]
*  I understand the reluctance and resistance, because it would impact families, but you [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=406.84s)]
*  could certainly pixel out the faces of the innocent that are slaughtered in this tape. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  I would like to one day air that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=417.64s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to check that and double-check that, because I've asked the same question [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  and we've had the difficulty that you mentioned with the families. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=428.2s)]
*  We'll do what we can, because I think you're right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=431.76s)]
*  I think if people see the horrors, the savagery, the worst violence meted on the Jewish people [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  since the Holocaust, yeah, I think it would sway a lot of people to understand what we're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=441.4s)]
*  up against. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=447.4s)]
*  And in fact, 80 years ago in the Holocaust, we were completely defenseless. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=448.4s)]
*  I mean, nobody came to our aid, and we were slaughtered in horrible ways. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=453.52s)]
*  Here, these Hamas terrorists, backed by Iran, had the same intent as the Nazis. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=458.52s)]
*  They would kill every last man, woman and child in Israel if they could. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=463.52s)]
*  They would slaughter millions of Jews here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=467.6s)]
*  But they had the same intent, but not the same capability, because after the surprise [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  attack, you know, we rebounded, and now we're killing these terrorists, targeting them, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=474.4s)]
*  not the population. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=480.2s)]
*  We're comporting with the laws of war, but we're finishing them off, and we intend [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=481.68s)]
*  to complete the job, because the days when Jews are slaughtered and our defenseless are [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  gone. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=490.68s)]
*  They're not going to be. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=491.68s)]
*  That's—because we always say no more, you know? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=492.68s)]
*  Never again. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=495.44s)]
*  Well, never again is now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=496.44s)]
*  Is—go ahead, Embry. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, just to be clear, I would make every single consideration to protect the identity [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=499.96s)]
*  so these—I would not bring any more harm to families that have suffered evil in their [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=505.48s)]
*  lifetime. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=510.4s)]
*  There are many of us, sir, that stand with Israel and are pulling for your victory in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=511.96s)]
*  this war on terror, and frankly, I'm very confident you will win it and win it decisively. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=516.16s)]
*  And as President Trump says, I hope it happens quickly. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=521.52s)]
*  These are rough times. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=525.72s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for being with us. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=526.72s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=530.0s)]
*  Thank you, and God bless America. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=531.0s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2PxQQ91CE&t=540.4s)]
