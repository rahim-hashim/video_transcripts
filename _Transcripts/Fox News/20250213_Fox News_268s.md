# TRUMP EFFECT: President’s leadership sparks geopolitical changes
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E)
*  All right, joining us now, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, by the way, thank you for the role that you played in all of this, and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=3.52s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio and Steve and everybody else involved. I'm sure I'm going to forget names [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  here. What are the broader implications to this? Because I see this as a gesture that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=12.88s)]
*  Vladimir Putin would never show to Joe Biden. Well, first, Sean, let's be clear. You know, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=19.92s)]
*  there are a number of people involved, but this is President Trump. This is the Trump effect that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  we were talking about before he was even inaugurated. But even in the weeks since, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=34.32s)]
*  we're now up to 11 Americans released. The ones today, as you said, CNN just couldn't believe it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=39.68s)]
*  that Belarus just released them for nothing. This is the Taliban. This is Venezuela. This is now [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=46.4s)]
*  Russia. And of course, Gaza, when he said all hell to pay, Hamas said, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=53.28s)]
*  we're going to enter into a deal. So President Trump is like just one of the greatest of all [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  time coaches. He's deploying all of us out on the field, including now Ambassador Steve Wittkopf. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=63.44s)]
*  And what's so amazing about Steve is, you know, he's not burdened by all of the decades of talking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=71.92s)]
*  points and this can't be done and only that can be done. It's kind of like, you know, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=78.8s)]
*  that unconventional thinking that outsider that understands closing deals has the instinct when [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=83.36s)]
*  to walk away and not take, you know, sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal that led to the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=89.84s)]
*  Abraham Accords in his first term and is going to get both Europe and the Middle East back into [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=94.72s)]
*  peace, focus on our Western hemisphere from the Arctic to our border, the Panama Canal, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=101.92s)]
*  and all the way down into South America. So it's you ask for the broader implications. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=108.0s)]
*  This is the entire world reacting to President Trump leadership, President Trump's leadership. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=114.4s)]
*  And once again, seeing our adversaries and our allies respect the United States of America and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=120.16s)]
*  its commander in chief. And that's these amazing effects that you're seeing, not to mention the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=126.56s)]
*  great team that he put around them. And I have an honor to be a part of. You know, I didn't like [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=131.52s)]
*  that the war in Ukraine seemed to devolve into a proxy war between Russia and the U.S. because, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=136.8s)]
*  you know, Joe Biden was paying for all of the weaponry and escalating the war in the last [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=143.28s)]
*  couple of months he was president. But I really, for the first time, I think there's hope and an [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=149.12s)]
*  opportunity that killing and the war and the murder and the mayhem. And what is your take on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  what's going on in the Middle East? There's a noon Saturday deadline for all of the hostages [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=162.16s)]
*  to be released or all hell will break loose. What do you see happening there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=168.0s)]
*  Well, just very quickly, Sean, today in the Oval Office, I mean, it was literally being a part of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=173.76s)]
*  history as President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin and then spoke with Zelensky. And both of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=178.8s)]
*  them said they are ready to end this war and they could only do it with President Trump's leadership. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=187.44s)]
*  I mean, just think about that for a second. This is a war that should have never started, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=193.92s)]
*  would have been deterred under President Trump's leadership. Putin invaded a neighbor under Bush, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=199.12s)]
*  under Obama and under Biden, but not under President Trump first term. And he's ready to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=206.16s)]
*  end it in President Trump's second term. That just happened today. You have Secretary of Treasury [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=210.8s)]
*  Bascent, Scott Bascent in Kyiv negotiating for equity in Ukraine's resources so that the American [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=217.12s)]
*  people can be recouped the billions of dollars. You have the VP, you have Secretary of State [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=226.24s)]
*  immediately getting into negotiations. And in the Middle East, I think Hamas caves. They will cave [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=232.88s)]
*  by this Saturday because they know President Trump means it when he says there's all hell to pay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=239.12s)]
*  I think Hamas and Iran better take his threat seriously. If they don't, they do so at their [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=244.72s)]
*  own peril. Anyway, great job. Their leadership needs to wave the white flag. All right. Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  Job well done. Thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqvfxoWG-E&t=256.96s)]
