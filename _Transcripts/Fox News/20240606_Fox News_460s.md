# Donald Trump: We need the 'death penalty' for drug dealers
**Fox News:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8)
*  And here is part two of my interview from just a few hours earlier with former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, are you following at all the Hunter Biden trial? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=6.8s)]
*  I am. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=11.8s)]
*  Okay. Let me ask you about two aspects of it. There's the legal aspect of it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=13.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=18.6s)]
*  Okay. The case seems pretty overwhelming on the gun charge in this case, in my opinion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=19.1s)]
*  He does not quite have this hostile of venue in Delaware as you have in here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=24.6s)]
*  Very friendly venue. I had the most hostile venue you could have. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=28.4s)]
*  We asked for a venue change and we asked for a judge change. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  None of which happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=35.4s)]
*  And they wouldn't do it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=36.4s)]
*  Okay. So, however, there's another aspect of it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=37.2s)]
*  And it's something that if you look at like, for example, the fentanyl flowing into this country that is killing our children in massive numbers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=40.8s)]
*  and opioids killing our children in massive numbers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=48.4s)]
*  There is this issue that is very real. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=51.7s)]
*  And I guarantee you there's not a person that's watching this show that doesn't know somebody, family member, friend, neighbor that hasn't had to deal with addiction. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=54.1s)]
*  You've had to deal with it in your life. You don't drink. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  No. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=65.8s)]
*  Never have. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=66.3s)]
*  No. Never had a drink. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=67.3s)]
*  I had a brother who suffered tremendously from alcoholism and alcohol. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=69.7s)]
*  And it was a terrible thing to watch. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=76.0s)]
*  He was an incredible guy with the best personality. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=79.4s)]
*  He was the best looking person you've ever seen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=83.1s)]
*  Everything was perfect, but he had an addiction. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=85.3s)]
*  And so I understand addiction because I was very close. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=87.9s)]
*  He was very close to me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=91.1s)]
*  He was an incredible guy, but he suffered it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=92.0s)]
*  And I've had many friends, but my brother suffered tremendously from this addiction. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=94.9s)]
*  In fact, he was older than me and he'd go out and say never drink. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=99.1s)]
*  Never ever drink. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=104.6s)]
*  Now in those days, drugs were not prevalent. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=105.8s)]
*  You know, you didn't have that, but he'd say never ever drink. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=108.4s)]
*  He knew exactly what he was saying. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=112.7s)]
*  I used to say, what does he always say? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=114.0s)]
*  But I never had a drink. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=115.3s)]
*  I was, you know, I'm not bragging about it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=116.4s)]
*  I know one thing about addiction is a lot of people say, what do you tell children? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  I say, if you don't have a drink, you're never going to have a problem. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=125.0s)]
*  If you do have a drink, you have a good chance that you'll be addicted or drugs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=128.9s)]
*  Because now it's drugs are probably equal to or greater. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=133.0s)]
*  I mean, what's so bad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=136.2s)]
*  And they're dying from a drug. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=138.7s)]
*  The size of a pinhead, a little bit of fentanyl, literally what could fit on the end of a pin, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=141.9s)]
*  can kill 10 people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=149.0s)]
*  It's crazy and so dangerous out there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=150.5s)]
*  And so many are dying where they think they're getting something and going to have a little [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=153.5s)]
*  fun on a Friday night and all of a sudden they're dead because of the power of what's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=157.0s)]
*  happening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=161.1s)]
*  And the sad thing is that I had an agreement with President Xi of China. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=162.4s)]
*  I said, listen, you're killing our people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=166.1s)]
*  It's going through Mexico and Mexico is paying a big price also from me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=168.9s)]
*  It's going through Mexico, coming through most of it is 95 percent coming through the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=173.10000000000002s)]
*  southern border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=176.8s)]
*  I built 571 miles of wall. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  And I had the Mexican army protecting us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=181.9s)]
*  I said, you're either going to protect us or I'm going to charge you big tariffs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=183.8s)]
*  And catalog very well with the president of Mexico. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=187.4s)]
*  They gave us tremendous protection during the time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  We had the best level of numbers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=192.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever had numbers like the best we've ever had in terms of illegal immigration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=195.0s)]
*  In fact, my last week in office, we had less people coming into our country than at any [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=199.9s)]
*  time before. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=205.5s)]
*  But importantly, we also had drugs were down 19 percent, 20 percent. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=206.3s)]
*  And that's not enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=212.3s)]
*  And by the way, you'll never really solve the drug problem unless you do what other [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  countries do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=218.4s)]
*  And that's the death penalty for drug dealers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=219.6s)]
*  If you have the death, a drug dealer on average will kill during that person's life 500 people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=222.6s)]
*  unless you have a death penalty, unless there's a something that they're right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=229.6s)]
*  They don't even get charged with anything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=234.0s)]
*  If you don't institute the death penalty for drug dealers, you'll never solve that problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=236.2s)]
*  You'll get it down to a number that like I got it down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=240.9s)]
*  Actually, at one point it was 22 percent down. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  That was a good thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  But you'll never solve the problem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=246.9s)]
*  We set up committees. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=249.2s)]
*  We set up all of this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=250.2s)]
*  The cartels are are run by very smart, very vicious people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=252.0s)]
*  They're pouring drugs into our country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=256.3s)]
*  Now, the number coming in now compared to four years ago is 12 times higher drugs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=258.0s)]
*  So it's not only people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=265.2s)]
*  It's not only human trafficking. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=266.4s)]
*  It's drugs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=268.0s)]
*  The drugs are pouring into our country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=268.7s)]
*  Totally unchecked. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=271.0s)]
*  Back to Hunter. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=272.5s)]
*  So you have sympathy for addiction. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=273.8s)]
*  Okay, I think most Americans do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=275.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=277.6s)]
*  That's not what the trial is about. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=278.4s)]
*  And I think there are bigger issues involving the Biden family. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=280.0s)]
*  We discussed we touched on it earlier and that is, okay, how does somebody with no experience get paid millions of dollars? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=283.5s)]
*  Goes on Good Morning America. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=291.7s)]
*  No experience. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=293.3s)]
*  Oil, energy, gas, Ukraine, millions of dollars. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=294.1s)]
*  Then, of course, Vice President at the time, Joe Biden, leverages a billion tax dollars to get a prosecutor investigating the companies and business with his sons and business with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=297.0s)]
*  fired within six hours using a billion of our dollars. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=308.0s)]
*  There are other. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=312.8s)]
*  You have a statute of limitations. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=313.6s)]
*  There are real legal issues. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=315.3s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=316.8s)]
*  They're really big stuff and their trial is look, I feel very badly for them in terms of the addiction part of what they have right now because I understand the addiction world. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=318.0s)]
*  And I've also not only a brother, I've lost a lot of friends to addiction, drugs, alcohol, and there are other addictions also, frankly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=327.5s)]
*  It would be nice if people would do certain things and live certain ways, but you're not able to they're just not able to break it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  I've had I've had friends that are so strong. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=341.3s)]
*  My brother was a strong person. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=344.3s)]
*  I've had friends that were so strong, so powerful. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=346.2s)]
*  They couldn't stay away from a glass of alcohol. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=349.7s)]
*  They couldn't stay away from a drug. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=352.2s)]
*  They had to have a drug. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=354.1s)]
*  But you know the way that you solve the problem don't have them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  If you don't have a taste for alcohol. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=359.3s)]
*  I remember when I was going to school college, I had a friend he hated the taste of scotch, hated it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=362.5s)]
*  It was like but he wanted to develop it because socially he thought it was a good thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=368.9s)]
*  You know, it's it down with the bankers and you know all the the Wharton School of Finance. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=373.9s)]
*  They want to have there's with bankers, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=379.5s)]
*  And they want to develop this taste for scotch. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  And by the time he finished, he ended up being a very bad alcoholic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=383.5s)]
*  He's I mean 20 25 years later. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=387.2s)]
*  He ended up being an alcoholic and he couldn't stay away. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=389.8s)]
*  I say the way you stay away. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_P8XOyma8&t=393.7s)]
