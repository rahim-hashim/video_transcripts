# Lindsey Graham: Trump will beat Joe Biden ‘like a drum’
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY)
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is with us. So, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=0.0s)]
*  you got 10 million or so unvetted, Joe Biden, illegal immigrants. We're paying for food, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=3.6s)]
*  water, housing, education, healthcare. Cities are overwhelmed. Even Democratic mayors and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=10.4s)]
*  governors have had it. And yet they've been telling us the whole time that the border is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=16.48s)]
*  secure and closed. It's not. And look at the impact. I mean, what is the endgame here? Why [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=21.2s)]
*  do they have no interest? Do they not, do they not get alarm bells in their mind when you hear [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=28.16s)]
*  people from Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan and Russia and China there? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=34.0s)]
*  Because that's where they're coming from. Yeah. Well, fentanyl poisoning of our young people is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=38.8s)]
*  the leading cause of death among Americans from 18 to 35. It's coming across the Mexican border. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=43.44s)]
*  It's made in China, comes to Mexico, comes across the border, the drug cartels, human traffickers are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=49.2s)]
*  the biggest beneficiary of the Biden presidency. Why is President Trump leading in South Carolina [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=55.68s)]
*  by 30 points? The people of South Carolina believe that Donald Trump was the best Republican [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=62.64s)]
*  president since Ronald Reagan. People in South Carolina do not believe that Trump creates chaos. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=67.68s)]
*  They believe that Donald Trump can clean up the chaos being created by Biden, that Donald Trump [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=74.08s)]
*  is our best hope to secure the border, to make us energy independent, to manage the economy and to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=79.68s)]
*  put out all the fires in the world. Nikki Haley is a good person. Tim Scott is one of my best [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=84.96s)]
*  friends. I endorsed Donald Trump on day one because I saw from a front row position of four [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  years of the toughest guy I've ever seen in Washington who brought the world to a better place [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  on national security than anybody since Reagan, who made a strong at home and strong overseas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to win South Carolina big, not because we don't like Nikki Haley. We do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=111.36s)]
*  We just believe Donald Trump is the best person to be president. And without Donald Trump, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=118.0s)]
*  there are no Trump policies. Can you explain this to me? We're going to have an open primary. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=123.2s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins the general election or not, he's won decisively in both New Hampshire and Iowa. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=128.48s)]
*  That's not happened since 1976. She's not competing in Nevada. So now we have South [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=134.08s)]
*  Carolina next and she's down real clear politics average down 30 points. Why would she risk losing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=140.72s)]
*  in her home state by such a big margin when she could come back in three, four years and run a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=148.0s)]
*  campaign in an open primary where I think anybody's odds would be better? Don't you think? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=155.12s)]
*  Well, Nikki Haley has been her friend for a very long time. She was a two term governor [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=161.12s)]
*  and people like her, her numbers are good at home. Why is she losing to President Trump? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=166.8s)]
*  It's no fault of her. It's the assets and attributes of President Trump. I can't express [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=172.32s)]
*  enough to the people watching your show that those of us in South Carolina who respect Nikki Haley [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=178.48s)]
*  believe that Donald Trump is the most capable person to be president that can beat Joe Biden, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=184.48s)]
*  but not just beat Joe Biden, clean up a broken border, scare the hell out of the terrorist, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=189.68s)]
*  help Israel who's under siege, make us energy independent again. Why do I say that? Because [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=195.68s)]
*  he did it before. Nobody running on the Republican side can say they've been president except him, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=201.36s)]
*  Donald Trump. And when you compare his presidency to that of Joe Biden, he's going to beat Joe Biden [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=208.24s)]
*  like a drum. That's why he's going to win South Carolina. That's why he's going to be the next [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=214.88s)]
*  president of the United States. He's the best person to do the job and to clean up the mess [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=220.08s)]
*  created by Joe Biden. And by the way, the way that Tim Scott's been treated by liberals in the media, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  the way many African Americans are treated that are conservative in the media, it's repulsive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, good to have you back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVZBrqzJrY&t=238.8s)]
