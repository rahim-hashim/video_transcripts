# Ted Cruz: This disastrous bill codifies Biden’s open border
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM)
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, I saw your comments about Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Rightly, I think you're very angry with him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=6.4s)]
*  Rand Paul, did you hear the same thing he heard, that he didn't want people like me [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=9.36s)]
*  getting the information about the bill? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=16.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=18.0s)]
*  And this whole thing has been a disaster from the very beginning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=19.0s)]
*  It's been a disaster on policy, and it's been a disaster on politics. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=22.0s)]
*  On policy, this bill is terrible. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=26.0s)]
*  It is an absolute—it is a bill that Chuck Schumer wanted that is designed not to secure [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=28.6s)]
*  the border, not just not to secure the border. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=35.28s)]
*  It's designed to make it worse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=37.6s)]
*  So this bill, as you noted, it codifies Joe Biden's open borders. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=39.44s)]
*  Catch and release, the cause of this crisis, it codifies catch and release. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=44.2s)]
*  It puts it into the law. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=48.08s)]
*  Not only that, it normalizes 5,000 illegal immigrants a day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  That works out to 1.8 million a year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=54.44s)]
*  That works out to about 6 million illegal immigrants over the three years of Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=57.24s)]
*  We have in fact seen 9.6 million illegal immigrants. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=61.32s)]
*  So the idiotic Republican proposal was, let's be for two-thirds of the border invasion that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=65.2s)]
*  Biden has allowed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=70.4s)]
*  That made no sense. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=71.94s)]
*  Not only did it put it into law, 1.8 million every year in perpetuity, but it also put [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=73.08s)]
*  into law giving those illegal immigrants work permits, giving them lawyers paid for by the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=79.4s)]
*  taxpayers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=85.72s)]
*  It gave billions of dollars to sanctuary cities to keep their policies going, and it gave [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=87.12s)]
*  billions of dollars to left-wing nonprofit organizations that are bringing the illegal [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=92.12s)]
*  immigrants in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=98.32s)]
*  So it funds the process. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=99.32s)]
*  And I'll tell you the provision that just as a Texan that pissed me off the most, it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=100.96s)]
*  went directly after the state of Texas and it said any litigation filed challenging this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=105.48s)]
*  law has to be filed in Washington, D.C. in federal district court. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=110.22s)]
*  So Texas can't sue in the federal courts in Texas, where Texas has been winning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=115.02s)]
*  Instead, they've got to go to Washington with the very liberal judges. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=119.3s)]
*  This was a disaster on policy grounds because it did not solve the problem, but politically [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=123.02s)]
*  it was even worse. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=130.06s)]
*  Who won in this battle? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=131.18s)]
*  And his name is Charles Schumer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=132.78s)]
*  Chuck Schumer did this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=135.14s)]
*  He knew it would fail. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=136.46s)]
*  He wanted it to fail. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=137.54s)]
*  But the purpose of this bill was to let every Democrat running for the Senate and running [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=139.1s)]
*  for the House to stand up and say, self-righteously, I wanted to secure the border. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=143.88s)]
*  I really wanted to, but those mean Republicans wouldn't let me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=149.04s)]
*  And I got to say, Senate Republican leadership, I told them this months ago. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=153.16s)]
*  Other conservatives told them this months ago, and they proceeded down this path that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=158.08s)]
*  ended up, it was a box canyon with a kamikaze pilot crashing into a wall. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=163.56s)]
*  It was a disaster and it was entirely avoidable because what happened is Republican leadership [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=169.22s)]
*  ended up benefiting Chuck Schumer and the Democrats and doing nothing to secure the border. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=175.74s)]
*  The amazing part about all this, Senator, is there is no need for Biden to get legislation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=181.9s)]
*  from anybody. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  He threw the, just the stroke of the pen, as I've been pointing out, put back in place [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  the policies that were successful. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=195.02s)]
*  Here's one interesting thing I noted in your home state of Texas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=197.1s)]
*  99.99% of illegal immigration in Eagle Pass, where you put up the razor wire, it has ended. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=200.5s)]
*  It shows that barriers work. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=207.74s)]
*  And now they move to California and Arizona. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=209.78s)]
*  And if Texas can build out more razor wire, I say they should continue doing what they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=213.1s)]
*  doing because it worked. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=217.1s)]
*  Texas is going to continue leading the fight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=219.74s)]
*  And we've got to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=222.22s)]
*  This crisis, it is massive. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=223.48s)]
*  It is devastating and we've got to lead the fight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=227.02s)]
*  And you know what Joe Biden is doing? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden is siding with the Mexican drug cartels against the American people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  I got to say the image of it just a few days ago of those six illegal aliens who beat up [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=236.3s)]
*  two New York police officers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=241.58s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=243.22s)]
*  And they got arrested. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=244.66000000000003s)]
*  And of course, what happens? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=245.9s)]
*  They get released from jail with no bail. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=247.02s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=249.88s)]
*  Walking out, they flip the bird on both hands. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=251.18s)]
*  Walking out, that image, Sean, is the image of this campaign in 2024. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=255.98s)]
*  That image, flipping the bird, is what Joe Biden and the Democrats and the senators saying [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=262.02s)]
*  to every American. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=266.98s)]
*  They stand with the drug cartels, the human traffickers, the illegal immigrants, the criminals, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=268.6s)]
*  and they stand against law enforcement and they stand against American families. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=273.58s)]
*  That's the message of this radical policy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=278.58s)]
*  And we've got to stand up and fight against it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=280.82s)]
*  272 days is an election, Senator. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  Your election is important, too. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=287.66s)]
*  And I know you're being targeted, but you were the first person I called when the bill [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=289.98s)]
*  came out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  I said, Senator, am I reading this correctly? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  And you said, yes, you're reading it correctly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=295.94s)]
*  But it's sad. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=299.18s)]
*  The fact that they didn't want the people to know the details, that speaks volumes about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  the current leadership. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  Good for people like you in the Senate that hold them accountable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=306.42s)]
*  Ted Cruz, thank you, sir. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  Republican leadership wanted to hide it from you and from the American people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=311.14s)]
*  And I appreciate your pointing out. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=315.14s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and George Soros are coming after me hard. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=316.98s)]
*  So I want to encourage folks, go to TedCruz.org. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=319.86s)]
*  I need your help. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=322.54s)]
*  We're going to fight to defend Texas and defend this country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=323.54s)]
*  We're going to be down in Texas and hopefully we'll see you and we'll go tour the border [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  together that Joe Biden has left wide open. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=330.46s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91X6dNzIwKM&t=341.06s)]
