# Tim Scott: This is the plot of the radical left
**Fox News:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE)
*  Joining us now is South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, let's get your reaction to all these developments today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=3.0s)]
*  You know, the system is so obviously fair. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  There's no victims here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=8.32s)]
*  OK, they had a disclaimer in every contract. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=9.6s)]
*  Not one person that they did business with complained. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=13.68s)]
*  Everyone was paid back with interest on time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=16.88s)]
*  Then the worst valuation of all came from the judge himself, and he was steadfast. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=19.88s)]
*  Right now you can go online and find a two acre property, oceanfront property in Palm [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=26.44s)]
*  Beach, just an empty lot, two acres, $200 million. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=31.28s)]
*  You're going to tell me that 22 acres is 18 million. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=35.8s)]
*  By the way, I'll find the money tomorrow. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=40.44s)]
*  I don't know how, but I'll find the money. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=42.52s)]
*  I'll buy that property. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=44.8s)]
*  I'll pay twice that amount. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=45.92s)]
*  Twenty-two acres in Palm Beach is worth a billion dollars without the buildings, without [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=49.24s)]
*  the name, without identifying the actual value of the property. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  All you need to know is if the liberal elite will weaponize the United States justice system [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=58.28s)]
*  against a former president, every single one of your millions and millions of viewers need [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  to know we could be next. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=71.56s)]
*  This is egregious. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=74.32s)]
*  This is disgusting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  But this is the plot and the plan of the radical left. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=77.4s)]
*  Hear me clearly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=81.28s)]
*  President Donald Trump represents the working class of America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=83.6s)]
*  He represents the victim who understands clearly the only thing standing between the liberal [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  elite and the everyday American is former president Donald Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  That's why we have to all lean in on this election and make sure that the results are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  indisputable, clear, crystal clear. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=107.36s)]
*  We must elect Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=111.8s)]
*  Not only will we better off with Donald Trump, but if you want to eliminate chaos and return [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=114.08s)]
*  to law and order, which means that lady justice wears a blindfold, you must vote for Donald [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=119.56s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  If you want to make sure that kids in the poorest neighborhoods in this country are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  afforded a great education and not the teachers unions making decisions for adults and not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=130.92s)]
*  If you want to make sure that every single American has a chance to live their American [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=139.0s)]
*  dream, Donald Trump is our only choice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=146.84s)]
*  And finally, Sean, if you are disgusted by this, if you're disgusted by this two tier [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  legal system, if you're disgusted by the actions in New York or this attorney general, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=158.24s)]
*  you must have your voice heard loud and clear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=165.28s)]
*  And that happens on election day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=170.4s)]
*  They are absolutely petrified that Donald Trump is bringing a coalition of working Americans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=172.3s)]
*  They're going to lie about issues like a bloodbath, even though they've used the words and there's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=179.24s)]
*  been more violent rhetoric about Donald Trump coming out of their mouths. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=183.76s)]
*  And we played a lot of that last night. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  They're going to demo. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=190.96s)]
*  They have said they will lie about abortion. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=192.04s)]
*  So, the Republicans better be prepared for these arguments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=195.24s)]
*  They will say democracy is in peril. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=197.24s)]
*  The very people that unilaterally would allow elected officials to make a decision to kick [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=199.44s)]
*  somebody off the ballot, talk about democracy in peril. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=205.92s)]
*  They will demagogue, they will call Republicans racist. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=208.92s)]
*  Ironically, coming from the guy that was partners with a former Klansman to stop integration [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=212.32s)]
*  of schools and public and public housing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=217.96s)]
*  They didn't want those schools to become racial jungles. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=222.68s)]
*  So that is their technique. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=225.56s)]
*  They can't, they can't run on, are you better off? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=227.32s)]
*  How do Republicans fight back? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=230.8s)]
*  This is the predictable attack. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=233.9s)]
*  This is what we're going to hear for the next 230 days. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Your advice to the Republicans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=240.0s)]
*  1000%. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=242.0s)]
*  Hey, we have to be seen and heard. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=243.0s)]
*  Go where you're not invited. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=246.0s)]
*  Make sure that we campaign in every single community in this country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  President Donald Trump has a 50 state strategy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=252.4s)]
*  We need to make sure that every Republican, every patriot, every parent who believes that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=255.16s)]
*  they should have a voice in the education of their kids, we must stand with President [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=260.04s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=264.96s)]
*  By doing so, our neighbors, our friends, our relatives will join this movement. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=265.96s)]
*  We need momentum. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=272.36s)]
*  We have the right candidate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=273.52s)]
*  This is our time to stand up for what America is today. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=276.04s)]
*  Not this utopian American dream that is our nightmare. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=280.18s)]
*  They want socialism. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=284.42s)]
*  We believe in free markets. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=285.86s)]
*  We must fight for the America that we have today and make sure that our kids benefit [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=287.54s)]
*  from it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  So get in the race, get in the fight and let's win this because this is not about Donald [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=298.5s)]
*  This is about your kids and your grandkids. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=299.5s)]
*  We win, they lose. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=301.94s)]
*  Let's make it happen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=303.54s)]
*  Let's make it happen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=305.66s)]
*  I don't think we can survive. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=306.66s)]
*  Elon Musk said, I don't think we survive four more years of this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=308.1s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zSLuOeyIAE&t=311.82000000000005s)]
