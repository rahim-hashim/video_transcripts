# Sean Hannity: This is beyond outrageous
**Fox News:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI)
*  We are praying for everyone in California tonight, including the firefighters, those risking their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=0.0s)]
*  lives to battle these flames. Keep in mind, this is not a rural area. This is the city of Los Angeles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=5.28s)]
*  It is the second most populated city in the country. It is also one of the wealthiest and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=12.16s)]
*  highest taxed areas in the entire world. And because of its dry, arid climate, wildfires [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=18.16s)]
*  always pose a massive risk. There's a lot of drought in Southern California. I lived there [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=25.36s)]
*  five years. And yet the city, the state, they seem totally, completely, utterly unprepared. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  In fact, the city's mayor, Karen Bass, was absolutely nowhere to be found. As the crisis [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=35.44s)]
*  was unfolding, she was in Ghana and took quite a lot of time to get back to L.A. When she did arrive, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Mayor Bass had no interest at all in answering any questions. This is beyond outrageous. Take a look. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=48.64s)]
*  Are you considering your position? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=78.64s)]
*  Madam Mayor, have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today who are dealing with this disaster? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=83.84s)]
*  No apology for them? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=94.72s)]
*  Do you think you should have been visiting Ghana while this was unfolding back home? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=98.88s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=109.28s)]
*  Well, there's a real mayor of the people. But Mayor Bass, Governor Newsom, the federal government, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=119.76s)]
*  they have all failed the people of California. Much of the dry brush all across all of Southern [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=124.56s)]
*  California has not been cut back for quite some time. They have a science. It's called forestry. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=131.2s)]
*  You have controlled burns. You prevent fires like this from happening. Now, the L.A. Fire Department, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=138.0s)]
*  they are understaffed. They are underfunded. Mayor Karen Bass increased, by the way, this year's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=143.84s)]
*  library budget, nearly $15 million, while simultaneously she cut the fire department's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=149.36s)]
*  funding by $17.6 million. That was only a couple of months ago. The mayor also recently touted a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=155.28s)]
*  $400 million handout from the Biden administration, $400 million that they allocated for green [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=162.48s)]
*  environmental efforts at the port of Los Angeles. On top of that, they spent another $2-plus billion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  and they can't afford to pay firefighters, knowing that wildfires like you're watching on your [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=178.72s)]
*  screen are common. Meanwhile, the city's fire chief obsessively prioritizing her department's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=183.76s)]
*  time funding for DEI. The water management and infrastructure in Southern California [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  is also a huge problem. Firefighters all across the city, encountering malfunctioning hydrants [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  as part of the city, is completely, you know, now they've ran out of water. And get this, because of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=202.8s)]
*  the state's insane environmental regulations, their capitulation to the environmental movement, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  well, it's designed to protect a rare, what, fish species, billions of gallons of water, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=214.88s)]
*  literally are dumped into the Pacific Ocean instead of being stored in reservoirs for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  emergencies like this. And several months ago, before the election, Donald Trump, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  well, he predicted, about four months ago, that this was a disaster ready to happen. Take a look. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  They said, we have no water. I said, do you have a drought? No, we don't have a drought. I said, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=239.28s)]
*  why don't you have no water? Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. It's got a natural [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=244.08s)]
*  flow from Canada all the way up north, more water than they could ever use. And in order to protect [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=248.72s)]
*  a tiny little fish, the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=255.36s)]
*  gallons of water gets poured. You know, your forests are dry as a bone. Yeah. Okay. Dangerous. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=263.44s)]
*  That water could be routed. You know, you could have everything. Oh, not only dangerous, billions [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=268.24s)]
*  of dollars a year they spend on forest fires. Now, this was not Donald Trump's only warning [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=273.52s)]
*  to California back in 2018 during his first term with Governor Newsom standing right beside him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, President Trump urged the state of California to manage their forests and cut back the brush. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=285.68s)]
*  Common sense, the science of forestry. Take a look. We get all of this cleaned out and protected. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=292.64s)]
*  Got to take care of the floors. You know, the floors of the forest. Very important. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=300.56s)]
*  You look at other countries where they do it differently and it's a whole different story. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=305.52s)]
*  I was with the president of Finland and he said, we have a much different, we're a forest nation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=311.67999999999995s)]
*  He called it a forest nation. And they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=317.2s)]
*  and they don't have any problem. And when it is, it's a very small problem. So I know everybody's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=323.2s)]
*  looking at that to that end. Now, sadly, Donald Trump's warnings fell on deaf ears and now the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=330.16s)]
*  people of California, they are suffering, but this was a disaster that had been brewing for many [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=336.8s)]
*  decades. And you can go to school, you can get a degree in forestry. This is not complicated science [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  in deep blue California. One party, they have all the power. There's no oversight. There's no [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  accountability. They have been catering to the radical environmentalists over people's safety [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=354.64s)]
*  for decades. You know, they can have limited control burns. They can have brush removal, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=360.24s)]
*  which is the kindling for these fires. Just like when they denied, you might recall, we were in the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=366.96s)]
*  San Joaquin Valley and they were denying literally, you know, thousands and thousands of acres of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=372.56s)]
*  farmland water. Farmers were not allowed to farm in favor of a little minnow fish called the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=379.68s)]
*  Delta smelt. We went out there and covered that story. Not even, it's not even an endangered [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=386.24s)]
*  species, but they gave the water to the Delta smelt, not to the farmers. You know, there are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=392.56s)]
*  no reality checks in California's one party rule. Listen to Adam Carolla, detail, his experience as [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=398.16s)]
*  a young man when he tried to apply to the LA fire department. Listen to this story. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=404.48s)]
*  I could not find a job. I walked to a fire station in North Hollywood. I was 19. I was living in the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=409.76s)]
*  garage of my family home. My mom was on welfare and food stamps and I said, can I get a job as [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=415.6s)]
*  a fireman? And they said, no, because you're not black, Hispanic or a woman. We'll see in about [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  seven years. And I went to a construction site and dug ditches and picked up garbage for the next [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=427.44s)]
*  seven years. I got a letter in the mail sent to my father's house saying, your time has come to do [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  the written exam for the LA fire department. I took it and I was standing in line and I had a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=439.28s)]
*  young woman of color standing behind me in line. And I said, just out of curiosity, when did you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=445.44s)]
*  sign up to become a fireman? Because I did it or a person seven years ago. And she said, Wednesday. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=449.84s)]
*  Now in the near future, when the fire has been contained, there's got to be a reckoning in all [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  of California, not just Southern California, but for now we do pray for everyone impacted by [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=463.52s)]
*  the devastating fires still raging all across the city. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfHq8YGuHQI&t=470.0s)]
