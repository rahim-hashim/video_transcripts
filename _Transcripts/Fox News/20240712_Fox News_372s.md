# WATCH: The best ‘ducks and dodges’ on Capitol Hill about Biden’s health
**Fox News:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98)
*  Another rough day for Democrats on Capitol Hill. Every single reporter had [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=0.0s)]
*  the same question for all of them. Should Joe Biden drop out of the race? And [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=4.5s)]
*  surprise, surprise, the Democrats, they're not so willing to answer. Here's a look [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=8.28s)]
*  at some of the day's best ducks and dodges. Take a look. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=13.32s)]
*  We're going to talk to him and ask him to step down. I mean, do you need to know what he's saying? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=17.48s)]
*  Our conversations throughout this week have been candid, comprehensive and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=21.48s)]
*  clear-eyed and that will continue for as long as we are in town. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=27.9s)]
*  Do you think it's okay to have a president though where there's this open question about whether or not he's in cognitive decline? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=31.54s)]
*  Do you think it was okay to have President Trump in cognitive decline for his entire four years? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=37.82s)]
*  Do you think Joe Biden has dementia, Senator Brown? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  Do you believe that he'll lose to Donald Trump in November, sir? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=49.34s)]
*  You know, just nothing really to say about it really. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=52.34s)]
*  Nothing that has eased your concerns yet? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=59.34s)]
*  I have nothing more to say about this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=64.34s)]
*  Do you believe he's your run for reelection? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=67.34s)]
*  I'm not. Am I speaking English to you? I'm not going to be making any statements about any of that right now in the hallway. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=68.34s)]
*  Anyway, here with Reaction South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=78.34s)]
*  Not surprising that they really don't want to answer that question, Senator. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=85.34s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=88.34s)]
*  Not at all, Sean. Listen, the Democrats are in absolute full panic mode. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=89.34s)]
*  Not because the President of the United States is unable to perform his duties as the commander in chief and the leader of the free world. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=94.34s)]
*  They're in panic mode, Sean. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=102.34s)]
*  Because their poll numbers are dropping like a lead balloon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=105.34s)]
*  It is remarkable to watch these Democrats not be able to answer basic questions from reporters. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=113.34s)]
*  Listen, the national media has been engaged in the greatest political cover up in generations by hiding the true position, mental fitness of Joe Biden. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=120.34s)]
*  But at the same time, Sean, they have engaged in character assassination of Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=132.34s)]
*  Two impeachments, Russia collusion, then a show trial. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=139.34s)]
*  This is the greatest tragedy before the American people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=144.34s)]
*  And that's why so many Americans are coming to Donald J. Trump's defense, because they smell a rat and it is clear as a bell. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=148.34s)]
*  But, you know, it's been kind of fun watching the Democrats stumble, fumble and unable to answer the one basic question. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=157.34s)]
*  Can he run again? When the real question is, can he finish? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=165.34s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. Does it really matter? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=170.34s)]
*  Because I see a party that almost universally has been radicalized and it's a Green Deal, radical socialist Marxist Party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=174.34s)]
*  I don't see policies on the border changing, law and order changing, energy changing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=184.34s)]
*  I don't see our education policies changing. They're still changing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=190.34s)]
*  They're still going to be beholden to the NEA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=194.34s)]
*  I don't see President Xi, the mullahs in Iran. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=197.34s)]
*  I don't see Vladimir Putin respecting Kamala Harris or any other name that's being mentioned. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=199.34s)]
*  Will it make a difference if they swap him out? I don't think so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=205.34s)]
*  You know, you make a fantastic point, Sean. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=209.34s)]
*  Bottom line is, in 2021, the first piece of legislation that Joe Biden signed was a $1.9 trillion package, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=212.34s)]
*  not for COVID, not for vaccines, not for health, but for their wish list, $1.7 trillion, that caught the entire economy on fire, leading to 9 percent inflation, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=219.34s)]
*  54 percent more expensive today is the gas we put in our tanks. What does all that spell? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=231.34s)]
*  It means that the incompetence of Joe Biden preceded any question about his mental acuity. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=237.34s)]
*  We should remember that. It is his incompetence. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=243.34s)]
*  And frankly, every single Democrat walks in lockstep with the philosophy that has made our economy implode, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=246.34s)]
*  that has allowed 10 million illegal immigrants to come across our border, allowing the spread of cancer called crime in the poorest inner cities in this nation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=255.34s)]
*  That won't change if it's Kamala Harris, Joe Biden or any other Democrat name that's been circulating right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=266.34s)]
*  What we need is four more years of common sense, four more years of a closed border, four more years of inflation under 2 percent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=273.34s)]
*  All that takes one person, Donald Trump. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=282.34s)]
*  All right. So it's not your first rodeo. Have you ever seen anything like this in the years you've been in Washington? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=286.34s)]
*  And how do you think it plays out? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=295.34s)]
*  I have never seen anything like this whatsoever. We can go back to the debate night just a few weeks ago. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=299.34s)]
*  We saw three things manifest. Number one, a very dominant Donald Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=305.34s)]
*  Number two, an embarrassing Joe Biden. And number three, the greatest threat to the American Republic in decades. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=310.34s)]
*  Our adversaries saw that capitulation, that dereliction of duty, the deer in headlights. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=319.34s)]
*  That's in a signal all across the country that what they knew was true. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=326.34s)]
*  But around the world, they were chomping at the bits. We need strong, powerful American leadership. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=331.34s)]
*  When we have that, Ukraine would not have a war today. In the Middle East, there would not be a conflict. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=339.34s)]
*  China, their aggressions would be passive against Taiwan. We had that four years with number 45. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=344.34s)]
*  We'll have it again with number 47 being Donald J. Trump. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=351.34s)]
*  Senator Tim Scott, great to have you as always. Appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTivzIsKU98&t=356.34s)]
