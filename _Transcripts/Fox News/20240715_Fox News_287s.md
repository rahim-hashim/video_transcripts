# Peter Doocy: This is unusual
**Fox News:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc)
*  We'll check in with Dana Perino, Newt Kingrich, much more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=0.0s)]
*  First joining us with the very latest from the White House, where Joe Biden just delivered [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=3.68s)]
*  a short speech calling on Americans to lower the political temperature is our very own [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=7.4s)]
*  Peter Ducey. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=11.64s)]
*  You know, Peter, I can go on and keep playing just his comments and Joe Biden's comments [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=12.64s)]
*  from last week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Maybe he needs to start by being a good example, because last week he was not a good example. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=19.88s)]
*  Sean, the next couple days, he will have a chance to demonstrate whether or not he wants [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=25.56s)]
*  to follow through on what he was just talking about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  They canceled some remarks that were scheduled tomorrow in Austin, Texas, but tomorrow night [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=33.32s)]
*  he's flying out to Nevada for some pre-planned campaign stops talking to unions. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=38.72s)]
*  And the campaign is telling us, remember this time last night when we were talking, we were [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=43.76s)]
*  reporting that the campaign was going to pull down all their TV ads for the time being. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  They're going to pause outbound communications. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=51.84s)]
*  They are going to resume making their case starting at some point tomorrow, where they [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=53.92s)]
*  lay out their version for the future and they will explain why they think the Trump and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Republican version of the next four years is not as good. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=64.8s)]
*  But to do that, they are going to have to make some major edits to the things that they [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=69.72s)]
*  have been saying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=74.4s)]
*  We have heard President Biden use lots of words to describe Donald Trump since the 2019 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=75.4s)]
*  campaign and since he has been president. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=80.44s)]
*  Now he is just calling him Donald and he is saying that he hopes that he is doing well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=83.64s)]
*  That is different. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=89.0s)]
*  There was a lower third, as you guys were coming to me, that said the RNC is going to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=90.6s)]
*  go on as planned. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=93.72s)]
*  There's been a change on the Trump side too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=95.48s)]
*  Selena Zito, who was a witness to the shooting yesterday, is reporting in the Washington [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=97.4s)]
*  Examiner that she just had an interview with Trump and he has rewritten his entire convention [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=101.68s)]
*  speech to be less about Biden and more about unity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=106.28s)]
*  So if Joe Biden is saying it's time to lower the temperature and Donald Trump is saying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=109.6s)]
*  I'm going to give a whole convention speech about unity, it is possible that this entire [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  campaign is going to go forward a lot differently than the last couple of years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  That's just if you take both these men at their word. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=126.28s)]
*  You know, in the same speech, and I'll get into more detail with Luke Ingrich in a minute [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=129.88s)]
*  about this, in that same speech, he did bring up January 6th, but interestingly, Peter, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  we had 574 riots in the summer of 2020. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=139.96s)]
*  We had a couple of dozen dead Americans. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=143.2s)]
*  We had cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, and thousands of cops injured [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=145.56s)]
*  and billions in property damage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=152.04s)]
*  And I'll get into Vice President Kamala Harris' days after a police precinct in Minneapolis [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=154.16s)]
*  was burned to the ground. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=159.24s)]
*  She tweets out a bail fund for the people involved in the rioting, but they said they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=160.36s)]
*  were mostly peaceful protests. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=164.84s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure that he's even in his own speech is living up to his standard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, it seems like they're having a tough time figuring out what the message needs to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  be because they know so little about the shooter. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  That is unusual more than 24 hours after an assassination attempt like this to know so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=180.44s)]
*  little. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  But as we understand it, the FBI has the guy's phone, the attempted assassin's phone, at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Quantico at their lab, and they are not able to get into it right now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=192.28s)]
*  So while they are telling us that they believe he acted alone and this was a lone wolf action, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  being investigated as an act of possible domestic terrorism, they can't see who he was talking [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  to, who he may have tipped off about plans. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=208.16s)]
*  And so I think we will hear the White House message on this evolve a little bit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=210.64s)]
*  But the general theme, once we know more about the shooter, but the general theme with regards [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  to this assassination attempt on Donald Trump, at least between now and November, is going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=221.08s)]
*  to be one of trying to lower the temperature a little bit, especially because Joe Biden [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=225.96s)]
*  is the person in charge of the executive, is the one who is in charge of the Secret [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Service for Donald Trump and whoever he rolls out as his running mate in the next couple [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  days. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=240.56s)]
*  And so he wants to put out the word. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=241.56s)]
*  This is a terrible thing that happened. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=243.24s)]
*  He will do whatever President Biden will do whatever he can to get them the resources [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=244.84s)]
*  so that they can be safe and they can try to settle this election according to the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  president tonight on the merits of the arguments and the policies and less about personal attacks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=253.61999999999998s)]
*  So there have been plenty on both sides over the last several years. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=260.26s)]
*  But both men are suggesting that maybe not so much, at least for the next couple days. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=264.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=270.98s)]
*  Peter Ducey, always great to have you, sir. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qut2-NLA1Vc&t=272.09999999999997s)]
