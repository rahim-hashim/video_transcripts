# Sean Hannity: Democrats hate Elon Musk more than ever
**Fox News:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs)
*  All right, welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, in mere moments, Elon Musk will join us live from the Washington swamp, a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=5.68s)]
*  huge day for Elon Musk, for SpaceX, for President Trump and for our country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=9.76s)]
*  If you were watching all day today, how could you not feel inspired, grateful, so glad that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=14.96s)]
*  these astronauts lost in space, basically, are now safely back home? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=20.44s)]
*  Now, the president did ask Elon to go get our stranded astronauts from the International [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=25.44s)]
*  Space Station, and he delivered. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=29.8s)]
*  He delivered big time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=32.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=33.24s)]
*  And we're going to stand by for splashdown located in the Gulf of America, off the coast [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=34.24s)]
*  of Tallahassee, Florida. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=41.16s)]
*  And splashdown, crew nine, back on Earth. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  It really is amazing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that is incredible. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=59.6s)]
*  What human ingenuity, engineering, the human spirit on display makes you proud to be an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  American. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=67.2s)]
*  Mission accomplished just hours ago. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=68.2s)]
*  The SpaceX Dragon re-entered orbit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=70.12s)]
*  It splashed down off the coast of Florida, safely bringing home Suni Williams and Butch [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=72.56s)]
*  Wilmore back to Earth after being trapped at the International Space Station since June [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=78.68s)]
*  of last year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=83.48s)]
*  Now, this SpaceX capsule that you see right there on your screen was traveling through [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=84.92s)]
*  space at a whopping 17,000 miles per hour before re-entering orbit and then gently gliding [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=89.76s)]
*  down to the ocean within a minute of their expected landing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=97.32s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to have plenty of politics surrounding the increasingly radical [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=101.56s)]
*  Democratic Party and Chuck Schumer's disastrous media appearances today. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=105.48s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=109.36s)]
*  As he officially now is on the chopping block and is fighting for his political life, along [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  with a full rundown of the newly released JFK files, but first, for a moment, can we [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=115.84s)]
*  just put aside all partisanship for a second? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=121.4s)]
*  I don't know if some people, if they're capable of it, if you suffer from Trump Derangement [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=124.12s)]
*  Syndrome. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=128.56s)]
*  Just take in this moment, how remarkable this is, this moment of time, what we're witnessing, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=129.56s)]
*  history in the making. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=135.84s)]
*  Right here, the United States of America, on Friday, the SpaceX Falcon 9 propelled [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=137.32s)]
*  its Dragon space capsule and crew into space. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=143.4s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=147.56s)]
*  I mean, that in and of itself, what you're watching on your screen, is such risk-taking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=148.56s)]
*  at the highest level. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=154.04s)]
*  And a few minutes later, the first stage booster, remember, performed a separation and a flip [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=155.96s)]
*  maneuver and then touched back down precisely at the landing, at landing zone one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Look at this touchdown. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  Right where it was supposed to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  The Dragon then separated from Falcon 9's second stage and was piloted to the International [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=171.76s)]
*  Space Station, where docking happened successfully. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=177.28s)]
*  Now keep in mind, this was one of three Falcon 9 missions in less than 24 hours. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=181.16s)]
*  In addition to this rescue mission, the Falcon 9 also delivered 74 rideshare payloads into [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=186.76s)]
*  orbit, added 23 Starlink satellites to the constellation, and on March 16th, the Dragon [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  successfully docked at the space station, and two days later, it successfully departed, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  ultimately returning our two stranded astronauts back to Earth on time to the minute. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  This was a safe return. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  But after nine months in space, both astronauts will have their fair share of health challenges. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Now according to NASA, for example, bones lose 1% of their density for every single [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=218.44s)]
*  month in space. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  Muscle atrophy can pose a huge problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=226.04s)]
*  They have to exercise every day in space, and they exercise for two hours a day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  The eyes, the brain structure, also change in space due to the lack of gravity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=233.98s)]
*  This can cause blurry vision and other serious problems. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  There's also a variety of skin conditions that astronauts experience as they reacclimate [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=242.32s)]
*  to Earth. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=247.44s)]
*  That's not an easy acclamation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=248.44s)]
*  Now, tonight we all wish both astronauts a speedy recovery and good health. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=250.16s)]
*  We are also extremely grateful to Elon Musk, the team at SpaceX, for getting them home [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=256.44s)]
*  safe and sound, for President Trump, to giving the okay for this mission to go forward. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=260.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, so many on the left, they are not grateful. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=266.08s)]
*  They are not thankful in any way, shape, manner or form. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=269.02s)]
*  Simply, they loathe Elon Musk now more than ever. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  This is a guy that rescues astronauts that were trapped in space. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  They were only supposed to be there eight days. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  They were there for 286 days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  He sends life-saving communications via Starlink to North Carolina and Tennessee after Hurricane [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=283.12s)]
*  Helene. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=289.04s)]
*  He sent them to California after the California wildfires. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=290.04s)]
*  He sent them to Ukraine after they were invaded. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  This is a guy working on the cutting edge of technology to advance the human condition, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=296.0s)]
*  improve life, including one of the things I'm most fascinated in, and that's Neuralink, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=300.92s)]
*  using AI technology and the human brain, which hopefully one day we will be able to restore [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=306.96s)]
*  vision to the blind and movement to people that have been paralyzed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  But now because he's supporting President Trump and he's working to make government [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=319.14s)]
*  more efficient and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, this is the thanks he gets from [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=322.92s)]
*  the left. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=327.76s)]
*  Elon Musk experienced death threat after death threat, Hitler comparison after Hitler comparison, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=329.08s)]
*  acts of domestic terrorism at his dealerships and at his charging stations. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=334.84s)]
*  You have Teslas lit ablaze, Molotov cocktails thrown at Tesla dealerships, Tesla stations [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=340.44s)]
*  burned to the ground, shots fired into Tesla showrooms, one in Oregon early this morning [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=346.88s)]
*  in Las Vegas. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=353.24s)]
*  Another attack, a suspect armed with a gun fired shots into a Tesla collision center [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=354.24s)]
*  while also lighting multiple vehicles on fire and spray painting the word resist on the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  front of that building. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=365.04s)]
*  This is not a protest. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=366.5s)]
*  This is not a simple act of vandalism for those idiots at MSDNC. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=367.72s)]
*  As Elon Musk posted himself on X, quote, this level of violence is insane. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=372.94s)]
*  It is deeply wrong. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=378.16s)]
*  Tesla just makes electric cars. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=380.0s)]
*  They have done nothing to deserve these evil attacks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=381.92s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=386.12s)]
*  What we're witnessing is terrorism, plain and simple, domestic terrorism. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=387.88s)]
*  These left-wing lunatics are committing these acts of violence to intimidate Elon Musk, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=392.72s)]
*  to intimidate Tesla owners and anyone that dares to disagree with their twisted worldview. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  That is the very definition of terrorism. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=403.04s)]
*  And now Attorney General Pam Bondi will be investigating and trying these perpetrators [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  as domestic terrorists. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=410.88s)]
*  And like most terrorists, I think that we're going to find that they're not very smart. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=412.72s)]
*  We did have one suspect in South Carolina allegedly trying to burn down a Tesla charging [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=416.64s)]
*  station with a Molotov cocktail and accidentally set himself on fire in the process. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  He is now facing a 20-year jail sentence and a federal prison. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=427.64s)]
*  This kind of violence is unacceptable in the United States of America, but for the radical [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  It's all just a means to an end. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=437.68s)]
*  But that won't deter President Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=440.2s)]
*  It's not deterring Elon Musk. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=442.08s)]
*  And today is proof that all of their hard work is paying off. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=444.36s)]
*  Now, we'll check in with Elon Musk in a minute. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=447.64s)]
*  But think about this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=449.88s)]
*  You know, for all the talk about January 6, January 6, January 6, OK, all the talk about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=450.88s)]
*  that, what about the 574 riots that took place in the summer of 2020, where we had two dozen [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=457.24s)]
*  dead Americans, we had cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, we had [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=465.12s)]
*  billions of dollars in property damage. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  And why didn't Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney have a committee looking into that violence? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=473.32s)]
*  Why did the preferred candidate of the left go on Colbert and say, those writers aren't [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=478.2s)]
*  going to stop? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=484.84s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6CLI8WOmVs&t=485.91999999999996s)]
