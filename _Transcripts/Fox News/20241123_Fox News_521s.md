# Sen. Lindsey Graham: The election was a referendum on Biden-Harris immigration policies
**Fox News:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8)
*  All right, Pam Bondi is president-elect Donald Trump's new pick for attorney general, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=0.0s)]
*  the left, they are melting down. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=7.04s)]
*  Big shocker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=9.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=10.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi is exactly what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=11.28s)]
*  because she's competent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=15.84s)]
*  We may not agree with her ideologically, but she actually knows how to do this job. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=17.38s)]
*  So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=21.86s)]
*  well, maybe Matt Gaetz will screw this up, and that'll give us some time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=25.84s)]
*  Pam Bondi knows what she's doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=29.12s)]
*  She is a dangerous and effective pick, and that's frankly worse than what we would have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=30.64s)]
*  got with Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=35.68s)]
*  Now, the left, they do have a right to be afraid, because Pam Bondi is an extremely [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=36.68s)]
*  qualified nominee. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=41.68s)]
*  She's going to be confirmed, as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=43.24s)]
*  She is a grand slam, touchdown, hole-in-one, ace, hat-trick, slam-dunk, Olympic gold medal [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=47.86s)]
*  pick. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=53.8s)]
*  Anyway, by the way, Senator Graham also had very strong words for the International Criminal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Court after it issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=59.64s)]
*  He calls the ICC a, quote, rogue, politically motivated organization that is trampling on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  the very concept of the rule of law. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=71.6s)]
*  Senator Graham joins us now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=74.6s)]
*  Senator, great to have you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm really angry. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  First of all, I don't like any of these. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  I know you played a golf tournament earlier today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  You look great, by the way, with the hat, nice hat. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=83.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=86.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=87.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=88.2s)]
*  I hope you played better than the way Trump says you play. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=89.2s)]
*  Trump told me, you need to work on your game a little. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=91.88s)]
*  I hope you had a better day today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=95.64s)]
*  He's right about a lot of things, including that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=96.64s)]
*  Including that, yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=99.32s)]
*  But I do have a Trump hat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=100.32s)]
*  No, thanks for having me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=102.36s)]
*  A little bit about, yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=104.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=106.92s)]
*  You go. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=107.92s)]
*  A little bit about Pam. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=108.92s)]
*  Home run pick. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=109.92s)]
*  I've known Pam for years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=111.36s)]
*  She's competent, capable, ethical, former attorney general of the state of Florida. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=114.12s)]
*  President Trump could not have chosen better. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=119.0s)]
*  The only people that need to worry about Pam Bondi are the ones who want to use the law [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=120.48s)]
*  for the political purpose. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=126.64s)]
*  Those in the Department of Justice who really want to make the Department of Justice an [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=128.32s)]
*  extension of politics. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=131.96s)]
*  Those are the people that need to worry. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=133.96s)]
*  She's going to clean house. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=135.56s)]
*  She's not going to engage in lawfare herself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=137.24s)]
*  She's going to give President Trump good advice in fighting crime, helping clean up this immigration [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  mess, making sure that we have laws to protect us against terrorism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=145.72s)]
*  Pam is the right person at the right time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Well done, Mr. President. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think the left, especially on the immigration issue, we have known terrorists [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=155.72s)]
*  in the country, we have gang members, we have cartel members, we have dozens and dozens [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=159.6s)]
*  of Americans like Lake and Riley that have been murdered, dozens raped, including children, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=165.36s)]
*  thousands of Americans victims of violent crime. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And all you hear from Democrats, Democratic governors, people in Congress and the Senate, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=174.24s)]
*  they care more about, quote, the rights. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=180.72s)]
*  I was saying this in my monologue tonight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=183.08s)]
*  They care more about the rights that illegal immigrants don't have than they do about the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  safety and security of the American people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=189.8s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=192.24s)]
*  I do not understand why they don't put our safety first. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=194.55999999999997s)]
*  Well, all I can say is that this election in large part was a referendum on Joe Biden [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=200.32s)]
*  and Kamala Harris immigration policy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=205.6s)]
*  When President Trump was president during his first four years with the Lewis illegal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=207.92s)]
*  crossings in December of 2020 and the history of the country, the bad guys were, you know, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=212.04s)]
*  afraid of fentanyl. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=218.44s)]
*  All trafficking is at an all time high. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=220.72s)]
*  Americans are dying by the tens of thousands from fentanyl poisoning coming through Mexico, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  originating in China, more terrorists in our country than any time since we've been monitoring [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=227.96s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  The first thing he's going to do is clean that mess up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  We're going to use a budget reconciliation process to get money to secure the border. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=236.24s)]
*  I'm going to work with Stephen Miller and Pam Bondi. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=241.24s)]
*  Criminal gangs, your dates are numbered. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=244.52s)]
*  Pam is coming after you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=245.96s)]
*  In states who want to continue this, sanctuary cities, your own notice, we should cut all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=247.68s)]
*  your money off. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=252.12s)]
*  So I've never seen so many dangers to our country as I do now from a broken border, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=253.4s)]
*  crazy immigration laws. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=259.04s)]
*  These people care more about the illegal immigrant than they do the average American citizen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=260.72s)]
*  And that's not just talk. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=266.66s)]
*  That's reality after four years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=269.48s)]
*  Let me ask you about the ICC and what they're trying to do to Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=272.04s)]
*  Now, as a predicate here, the UN, for example, all of these globalist groups that we often [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=277.48s)]
*  fund, they have historically been anti-Semitic and anti-American. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=285.92s)]
*  The UN is a good case in point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  The WHO, they were the propaganda wing for the communist Chinese during COVID. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  The WEF, they don't have our best interests at heart. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  All these globalist agreements, the Paris Accords, yeah, okay, India, China, developing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  nations, we pay the freight. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=305.6s)]
*  So my question is, they don't have jurisdiction. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  What part of terrorism does this court not understand? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=311.48s)]
*  What part of murder, rape and kidnapping and torture and beheading do they not understand? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  Because that's what happened on October the 7th. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=322.8s)]
*  Yes it did. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=327.44s)]
*  And, you know, Israel's in a fight for its very life. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=328.44s)]
*  The Jewish state is under siege from Hamas and Gaza, Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=331.56s)]
*  Iran has directly attacked Israel. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  And we live in an upside down world where the Prime Minister of Israel and the Defense [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=339.96s)]
*  Minister of Israel are being prosecuted by a court in Belgium. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=344.72s)]
*  Now let me say this, the court ruled that Gaza is a state. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=348.0s)]
*  No, there is no Palestinian state under international law. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=352.4s)]
*  So that's the first thing they got wrong. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=356.04s)]
*  And Israel's not a member of the International Criminal Court, nor are we. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=358.16s)]
*  In 1998, I fought the idea that we would join the International Criminal Court. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  Sovereignty. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  I do not want a court in The Hague trying American soldiers or American politicians [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  defending our country. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  This is a direct threat to the state of Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=375.68s)]
*  There have been more resolutions condemning Israel and the UN than every other nation, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  all the nations combined. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=383.04s)]
*  This anti-Semitic body in this court is trying to literally put in jail the Prime Minister [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o1NvoP_yH8&t=384.72s)]
