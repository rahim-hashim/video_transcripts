# Tulsi Gabbard: The Biden admin is 'lying to the American people about their story'
**Fox News:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk)
*  Fox News contributor and former presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard joins me now. So Tulsi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=0.0s)]
*  everybody says Biden behind the scenes when he's not being produced is even worse than what we see [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=5.2s)]
*  on camera. Jesse, you know, I think there there's obviously concern about what people are seeing, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=11.36s)]
*  but I think there's there's a disconnect as that ad that they're running clearly shows. There's the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=19.44s)]
*  the reality that that lives within those who talk about politics as though it's a game and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=24.8s)]
*  are you on this team or on that team? But those who are showing concern are people who actually [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=29.76s)]
*  live in the real world, people who are understanding the consequences of Joe Biden's policies, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=35.28s)]
*  the real world that they live in, where they have to worry about whether or not their paycheck is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  going to go as far as it used to. Can they afford rent? Can they afford their mortgage? Groceries [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=46.56s)]
*  are costing more and more money. Maybe their kid just got sick and they don't know how they're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=51.36s)]
*  going to afford that hospital bill. We look at foreign policy under the Biden administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=55.6s)]
*  They see how President Biden is literally playing chicken with nuclear war with Russia, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  putting us closer to the prospect of direct conflict with both Russia and China and families [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=66.88s)]
*  and parents wondering, hey, are my kids, are my brothers and sisters in uniform going to be the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=72.72s)]
*  next part of that high body count that will certainly come as a result? So I think it's this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=78.4s)]
*  reality that people are seeing that come as a consequence of President Biden and his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=84.32s)]
*  administration's policies that will be harder to ignore as they approach their decision that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=89.6s)]
*  they'll make at the ballot box. You heard the NPR swing state voters. It wasn't just old. That was [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=94.32s)]
*  just one description. It was, we got two seniles and when you say senile, it takes an upper level [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=100.16s)]
*  and it connects it to the policy. Someone can be old, but they can execute policy. If you're senile, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  then you can't execute policy and that speaks to the danger of Biden's foreign policy. It [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  speaks to the danger of his border policy, the danger of his fiscal policy, inflation's nuts, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=120.72s)]
*  and if voters can connect the senility to the crazy policies, that's just deadly for a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=126.72s)]
*  presidential campaign. It is because as the Biden administration again showed in that ad, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=133.84s)]
*  they think that they have a messaging problem that somehow their beautiful story is not being [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=140.72s)]
*  told, but they're actually lying to the American people about their story. The reality that we are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=146.08s)]
*  living in this country is what we know to be true, regardless of whatever lies they may be pushing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=152.96s)]
*  out through their friends in the propaganda media and that reality is a very, very serious one that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=158.96s)]
*  has to do with our economy, our wellbeing, our livelihood, and most importantly, our ability to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=165.68s)]
*  live in peace and not have the prospect of war destroying us as a country or nuclear Armageddon, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  which is where Biden has put us as a country, closer to that potential and possibility. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the ad was crazy. He has Democrats arresting Donald Trump and he's complaining about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  him not getting enough news coverage for Bidenomics. That doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=192.48s)]
*  Exactly. It's completely out of touch with reality and I think you bring up how [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=200.32s)]
*  Biden has weaponized the Department of Justice and undermining the rule of law, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  trying to take out his political opponent, but we've also seen in the news this week how they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=208.64s)]
*  are also targeting peaceful pro-life protesters, literally locking up a grandmother who is in her [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=213.44s)]
*  upper 70s for years in jail for being a peaceful pro-life protester at an abortion clinic. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=220.72s)]
*  There are a lot of Americans who are being targeted by this administration who are not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=227.68s)]
*  seeing their names and their stories in the news, but this is the new norm that we can expect under [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=231.6s)]
*  a Biden-Harris administration or even if they take Biden out and put in Harris, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=237.84s)]
*  we will see the destruction of our democracy and an escalation pushing us closer and closer [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=242.72s)]
*  towards truly this banana republic that they are creating for us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=247.92s)]
*  Well, a Harris administration. I don't even know if I can say that on television. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=251.44s)]
*  I might have to bleep it. Thank you so much, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=256.32s)]
*  Thanks, Jessie. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-y6UkDk_Bk&t=261.03999999999996s)]
