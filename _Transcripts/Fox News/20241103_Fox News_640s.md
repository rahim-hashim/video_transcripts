# Hannity: This could be the closest election in American history
**Fox News:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY)
*  All right, Donald Trump, in Macon, Georgia, tonight, his third rally of the day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe he has four tomorrow. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=4.48s)]
*  In 48 hours, the polls will be closed and the results will start pouring in. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=6.8s)]
*  This could very easily be the closest election in American history. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=11.36s)]
*  Nate Silver put it this way. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=15.48s)]
*  He calls it a pure toss-up, with an advantage towards Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=16.72s)]
*  What does this mean for all of you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=20.52s)]
*  Please assume, as I have been telling you, that your one vote will determine the outcome [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=22.44s)]
*  of this election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=28.2s)]
*  For those of you who voted early, I want to say thank you, because you know what? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=29.48s)]
*  You're doing your part. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=33.44s)]
*  But for the 80 to 90 million people, Americans, that will be voting on Election Day, please [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=34.92s)]
*  know the stakes could not be higher. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=40.82s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to get to the latest polls from key battleground states around [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=46.16s)]
*  We have a lot of polling today with some of the top pollsters in the country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=47.16s)]
*  We begin with an unfortunate truth about today's radical, extreme, democratic, socialist Marxist [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=50.92s)]
*  party. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=57.88s)]
*  For most Democrats, power is the only thing that matters. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=58.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=61.68s)]
*  Look at Kamala Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=62.68s)]
*  She doesn't have a plan to improve your life for months. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=63.92s)]
*  She didn't even have a single policy proposal on her website until her poll numbers started [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  to take a dive. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=71.28s)]
*  She wouldn't talk to the press. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=72.28s)]
*  She wouldn't answer questions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=73.78s)]
*  Axios is calling Kamala the, quote, no comment candidate because of her lack of transparency, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  her shifting positions, her vague statements, word salads on top of it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=81.44s)]
*  She's not putting forward good ideas because she doesn't have any. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  When you look at her really deeply held principal views, she can't tell them to the American [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=91.24s)]
*  people because they're so out of the mainstream. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  She's not touted her own record because it's terrible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  She can't run, are you better off than you were four years ago, because you're not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  Instead, she's trying to scare people, trick people, and use fear and fear mongering into [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  voting for her. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=114.6s)]
*  Almost everything she is now saying is an outright lie. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=117.16s)]
*  For example, you have probably heard Kamala praising Gen Z over and over and over again [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  on the campaign trail. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=125.48s)]
*  Yeah, but here's what she actually said about that 18 to 24-year-old demographic before [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=126.72s)]
*  she desperately needed their votes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=131.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=133.72s)]
*  What's the other thing we know about this population? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=134.72s)]
*  And it's a specific phase of life. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Remember, age is more than a chronological fact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=139.28s)]
*  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=142.2s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=145.56s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=149.56s)]
*  And they have a resident assistant. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=153.44s)]
*  They make really bad decisions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=156.56s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=160.28s)]
*  Now, the only thing that would make them stupid, if they voted for somebody that called them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=161.28s)]
*  stupid. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=165.36s)]
*  Now, Kamala's not just lying about young people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=166.36s)]
*  She does this with every demographic in order to scare the elderly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=168.8s)]
*  She is lying to them and saying Donald Trump wants to upend Medicare and limit Social Security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=174.2s)]
*  It's an outright lie. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=179.28s)]
*  Benefits under Donald Trump, his first term, increased, and he has pledged to never, ever [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=181.2s)]
*  touch Social Security or Medicare. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=186.04s)]
*  It is beyond repulsive that Kamala Harris will scare old people and lie to old people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=189.28s)]
*  like this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=195.0s)]
*  And in order to scare women, Kamala is out there claiming Donald Trump wants a national [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  abortion ban. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  He has said over and over and over again, he does not, that he wants to limit contraception. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=202.16s)]
*  He has never said any such thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=207.56s)]
*  An outlaw, IVF, when he said just the opposite. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=209.8s)]
*  These are all egregious lies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=213.52s)]
*  The exact opposite is true. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=215.18s)]
*  I hope women won't believe her lies. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  And look at this headline. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=220.24s)]
*  The Harris campaign is now using two entirely different messages on Israel and Gaza, depending [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=221.24s)]
*  on whether you live in Michigan or Pennsylvania. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=228.24s)]
*  If you live in Michigan, well, Harris is pandering to the Arab communities with lofty words about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  the suffering in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=237.8s)]
*  But if you live in Pennsylvania, the ad is all about protecting Israel's right to exist. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=239.52s)]
*  And meanwhile, fear mongering surrounding minority voters across the country is through [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=244.4s)]
*  the roof. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=249.06s)]
*  But in reality, under Trump's first term, pay close attention, African Americans, Hispanic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=250.1s)]
*  Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, African American youth unemployment were thriving [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  like never before. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=262.64s)]
*  Let's take a look at the numbers from a 2020 Fox Business article. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=264.24s)]
*  Quote, while the overall growth rate was 6.8 percent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=268.48s)]
*  Now compare that to the 12,000 jobs just created that we found out about in the last month. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=272.68s)]
*  12,000? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=278.48s)]
*  That is anemic to say the least. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=279.94s)]
*  Anyway, 6.8 percent real median income grew by an even greater number. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=282.64s)]
*  Seven point nine percent for African Americans, seven point one percent for Hispanic Americans, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=287.64s)]
*  ten point six percent for Asian Americans, all record highs and record income levels. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=293.64s)]
*  We had record low unemployment for every one of those demographic groups, record after [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=300.44s)]
*  record after record. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=306.24s)]
*  In 2019, the poverty rate plummeted one point three percentage points to a 60 year low. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=307.44s)]
*  Over four point one million people lifted out of poverty. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=313.94s)]
*  The child poverty rate also decreased to a sixth decade low. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=317.74s)]
*  Kamala Harris says she wants to cut taxes on the middle class. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=322.14s)]
*  No, again, she is lying. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=326.04s)]
*  If she is elected, she has promised to let the Trump tax cuts that created that economic [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=328.04s)]
*  growth and prosperity for all demographics expire. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=333.74s)]
*  A massive tax increase for every American. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  And you will be guaranteed to keep paying more money for energy, for gas, for groceries [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=340.64s)]
*  on top of the taxes on unrealized capital gains. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=345.64s)]
*  And no, Donald Trump demanding free and fair trade with other countries will lower prices. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=349.04s)]
*  It will not increase them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  It is not a tax. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=355.54s)]
*  So in Kamala's first year in office, all of your taxes will go up and you will your take [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=357.04s)]
*  home pay will be far less. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=363.04s)]
*  But if you really want to know what your life is going to be like under a Harris administration, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=365.44s)]
*  you don't need a vivid imagination. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=371.04s)]
*  Ask yourself basic questions because there's going to be 80 to 90 million people voting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=373.44s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=379.14s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=380.74s)]
*  Is your border our borders? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=384.54s)]
*  Are they more secure or are they less secure? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=386.44s)]
*  Is the world more peaceful or more chaotic or in Europe or in the Middle East? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you have more money or less money in your pocket? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=395.14s)]
*  Do your groceries, are they more expensive or are they less expensive? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=399.04s)]
*  Are you paying more to heat and to cool your home? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=403.74s)]
*  When you fill up your car, your truck, is gas more expensive or less expensive? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=407.04s)]
*  About a buck fifty more a gallon. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=412.74s)]
*  Have your insurance rates gone up? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=414.54s)]
*  Interest rates much higher, almost doubling the cost of the average person's mortgage. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=416.44s)]
*  What about violent crime? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=422.73999999999995s)]
*  How's that defund, dismantle, no bail, re-imagine the police thing working out? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=423.94s)]
*  Do you feel more safe, more secure in your town, in your city? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, according to newly revised FBI numbers, violent crime is up a whopping 4.5 percent. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  These revised numbers detailed an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=439.04s)]
*  37,091 aggravated assaults. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=450.14s)]
*  And according to recently released federal numbers, more than 15,000 illegal immigrants [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=453.74s)]
*  now living inside our country have been convicted or accused of murder. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=459.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of suspected terrorists who crossed into Harris-Biden borders unvetted, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=464.34s)]
*  they're still living in the United States. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  We have terrorists here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=473.94s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=475.44s)]
*  We just don't know where they are. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, this has been the biggest failure on every level. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=478.44s)]
*  They can't run on a single program that they have implemented that has made your life better. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=483.94s)]
*  The so-called no-lie, smear, slander, besmirchment is the only thing the Harris campaign's got left. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  Remember, all Trump supporters, all of us, we are Nazis, fascists, racists and garbage on top of all of that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  We're just trash. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  And right on cue, New York's Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who said, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  conservatives like me need to get on a bus and go to Florida. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=509.34s)]
*  And I took her advice. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=512.8399999999999s)]
*  I went on a bus and I moved to the Florida Bureau of Fox because she's saying Trump supporters, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=514.04s)]
*  yeah, you're un-American. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=520.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=522.24s)]
*  If you're voting for these Republicans in New York, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=523.74s)]
*  you are voting for someone who supports Donald Trump and you're anti-woman, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=526.8399999999999s)]
*  you're anti-abortion, and basically you're anti-American because you have just trashed American values [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=531.04s)]
*  and what our country is all about over and over and over. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=537.54s)]
*  And you will wear this on Election Day. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=540.54s)]
*  It's like the governor before her, Andrew Cuomo, you know, talking about, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=544.14s)]
*  If they're not New Yorkers, if they're pro-life and pro-Second Amendment, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=548.04s)]
*  they're not New Yorkers and there's no place in New York. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  He actually said it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=557.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, another Harris surrogate said that he wanted to slap Republicans on the ass. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=558.3399999999999s)]
*  Go for it. Take a look. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  They want another giant tax cut for the wealthy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=570.54s)]
*  I'll tell you what, man. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  I just granted, I used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=575.74s)]
*  But I'm serious. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=581.74s)]
*  These are the kind of guys you like to smack in the ass. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=584.04s)]
*  Sounds like a threat of violence to me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=590.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=592.34s)]
*  It's better than biting off children's toes and biting children at Halloween parties. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=593.34s)]
*  Anyway, just to keep track, according to the Harris campaign, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=597.94s)]
*  anyone who doesn't vote for Kamala is un-American, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=600.64s)]
*  a fascist-loving Nazi who's also a piece of garbage, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=603.44s)]
*  and un-American now we hear from Kathy Hochul, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=606.94s)]
*  and somebody that Joe Biden wants to slap. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=609.84s)]
*  That's the closing message from the Harris campaign. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=613.34s)]
*  That's why her most egregious lie to date is that she actually claims she wants to unite the country. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=615.94s)]
*  She just wants to win the election and get more power, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  and she doesn't care about the state of our union. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eAH2jkDpY&t=625.1400000000001s)]
