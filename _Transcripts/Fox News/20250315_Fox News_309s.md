# Vivek Ramaswamy reveals plans to eliminate Ohio income tax
**Fox News:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY)
*  Other leaders can follow the Trump model, bring the same vision to their jurisdictions, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=0.0s)]
*  our next guest, who wants to bring the state into the fold of the few proud places in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=5.2s)]
*  country where there will be zero state income tax. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=10.68s)]
*  His name, Vivek Ramaswamy, candidate for governor, great state, Buckeye State of Ohio. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=14.08s)]
*  I got to give you a lot of credit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=19.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of people, they watch Donald Trump, but they don't seem to learn a thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  When I heard your proposal, I said, he gets it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  You know, Americans, the people of Ohio, they want bold, limited government, greater freedom, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  and they don't want the burden of government smothering their lives the way it is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=37.2s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=43.64s)]
*  I'm going to lead Ohio to be a zero income tax state. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=44.64s)]
*  We're going to get rid of the income tax because at the end of the day, it is your money, not [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=47.08s)]
*  the government's, and you deserve to keep what you earn. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=50.92s)]
*  Even Trump is being ambitious at the federal level. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=54.72s)]
*  We need leaders at the state level who are going to be equally ambitious as governors. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=57.04s)]
*  And I say this from a state, the state of Ohio, that sent the first man to walk on the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=61.36s)]
*  moon, Sean. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=65.96s)]
*  This won't be the greatest feat that Ohio has ever achieved. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=67.18s)]
*  There have been greater feats accomplished in human history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=69.88s)]
*  It's relatively straightforward, but what we actually need as a governor is to see that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=73.12s)]
*  grow. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=77.56s)]
*  Ohio State football accomplished a lot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=78.56s)]
*  That's right, exactly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=79.56s)]
*  They accomplished a lot too. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=80.56s)]
*  That's right, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=81.56s)]
*  If we want to be a championship team, let's play like one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=82.56s)]
*  And I want, the reason I'm saying this now, Sean, to be super frank about this, is I want [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=85.4s)]
*  families across the country to know, to put you on notice, you are able to come to Ohio, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=89.52s)]
*  even if it takes you a couple years to get here, we're going to be a zero income tax [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  state. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=98.6s)]
*  So I want businesses coming back here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=99.6s)]
*  I want people moving back into the state. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=101.28s)]
*  I don't want to take anything for granted, but it appears highly likely that I'm going [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=103.48s)]
*  to be the governor before very long. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=106.36s)]
*  And when I'm going to be governor, I'm going to be the governor before very long. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=108.04s)]
*  I'm governor. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=111.36s)]
*  We're going to bring down that income tax. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=112.36s)]
*  So I want everybody across the country to know we're going to be one of those zero income [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=114.16s)]
*  tax states. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=117.88s)]
*  So as much as our friends here, many of them, for good reasons, spend six months and a day [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=118.88s)]
*  in Florida or Tennessee or other states, I want to repatriate some of those people back [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=122.6s)]
*  to our own home state of Ohio. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=127.0s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do, Sean. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=128.92s)]
*  By the way, it's a bit of a myth. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=129.92s)]
*  If you come from a state like New York, they want to tax you every day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=131.36s)]
*  They want to, they will come after you with a vengeance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=135.44s)]
*  You have to cut that cord so hard that they can never come after you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=138.16s)]
*  I mean, that six months and a day thing doesn't work when you have, you know, first you'll [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=142.68s)]
*  have people like Andrew Cuomo say, if you're one of those New Yorkers that's pro-life [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=147.6s)]
*  and pro-second amendment, you're not a New Yorker and there's no place for you in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  state of New York. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=158.2s)]
*  And Kathy Hoco, Lee Zeldin, Trump, get on a bus, go down to Florida. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=159.2s)]
*  All right, so I go to Florida. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  And then all the tax people want to chase me down and take my money. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=163.88s)]
*  So I have to stay down here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=167.08s)]
*  But in all seriousness, a lot of people ask the question, okay, how do you make up for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=168.84s)]
*  that revenue? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  Now, Reagan cut taxes, doubled revenues in eight years to the federal government and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  gave us 21 million new jobs in the longest period of peacetime economic growth until [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=180.36s)]
*  the first three years of Donald Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=185.44s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you really nailed that, Sean, is economic growth is the answer that everybody forgets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  We're going to have a second industrial revolution worth of a boom in Ohio if we get rid of that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=194.92s)]
*  regulatory state, downsize government and actually get to a zero income tax state. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  So people are moving into the state rather than out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=204.32s)]
*  That alone is an economic win. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=207.16s)]
*  Combine that with a lot of the elimination of waste, fraud, abuse. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  You're seeing that at the federal level, as I believe we're going to have to see at the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  states. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  That's how you actually lift up an economy in a lasting way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Look, in the long run, I'm of the school of thought, Sean, that in the very long run in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  the United States, I'd like to see the elimination of the income tax across the United States [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=223.56s)]
*  of America. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=227.4s)]
*  It was only in 1913 that we adopted an income tax. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=228.4s)]
*  For most of our national history, we didn't have one. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=232.0s)]
*  I want Americans across the board to be able to keep as much of what they earn so they [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  have an incentive to work and incentive to achieve. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=238.08s)]
*  But I do think in the next step, a lot of states are going to have to step up and lead [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=241.52s)]
*  the way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=244.52s)]
*  We're going to do our part in Ohio. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=245.52s)]
*  And I want to see a population boom of attracting people back into the state as I expect we're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=246.96s)]
*  going to start to see, frankly, even in the next 18 months and then hopefully even longer [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=251.68s)]
*  after we then implement that in my first year in office. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=255.8s)]
*  Listen, I get what you're trying to do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=258.48s)]
*  You're trying to compete with my free state of Florida. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=259.92s)]
*  I'm betting on my state, but you can come in number two. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=262.24s)]
*  I'm fine with that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=264.64s)]
*  I'm OK with that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=265.64s)]
*  And we love your state, Sean. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=267.08s)]
*  In fact, we've got to learn some lessons, like the zero tax lesson. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=268.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=271.08s)]
*  We're bringing that over here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=272.08s)]
*  Now Governor DeSantis is talking about dropping the property taxes significantly because revenue [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=273.08s)]
*  has gone up so dramatically as property prices have gone up dramatically because of the influx [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  of people from places like New York and New Jersey and Illinois and California. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=285.6s)]
*  The Vague Ramaswami, thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=291.8s)]
*  It's a great trend. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=293.04s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=294.04s)]
*  What? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=295.04s)]
*  On those property taxes too. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=296.04s)]
*  I agree with you, Sean. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6pt52SNKY&t=297.04s)]
