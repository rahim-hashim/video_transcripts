# Sean Hannity: The chaos continues
**Fox News:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=0.0s)]
*  We start with this Fox News alert breaking tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  The chaos continues at college campuses all across the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  Alexis McAdams will join us live from New York University, where tonight agitators are [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=8.64s)]
*  desperately trying to regroup after many arrests today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=14.0s)]
*  Now, this includes Fordham University, where trespassers set up tents inside an academic [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  building and even unfurled their very own giant Antifada banner over a bridge. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=23.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the left coast, UCLA classes have been canceled after what was a brutal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=29.28s)]
*  night of violence and widespread hand-to-hand fighting as college administrators looked [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=34.52s)]
*  on and they did nothing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=40.28s)]
*  At the University of Wisconsin, four police officers were injured and nearly three dozen [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=42.44s)]
*  so-called protesters were arrested after anti-Israel agitators clashed with law enforcement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=47.32s)]
*  At UT, Austin, Texas, numerous weapons, including firearms, were confiscated as police began [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=55.0s)]
*  making arrests there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=61.52s)]
*  And last night, right on this program, as it was unfolding, Columbia University thankfully [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=63.2s)]
*  was liberated from the radical pro-Hamas agitators that were squatting on campus for weeks and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=68.2s)]
*  recently had pillaged an academic building, reportedly even detaining three janitors in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=74.52s)]
*  the process. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=79.64s)]
*  The order, thankfully, was restored in a matter of hours without any serious injuries or incidents, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=80.64s)]
*  all thanks to, frankly, the swift professional work of the NYPD. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=86.68s)]
*  They deserve a round of applause. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=90.8s)]
*  Anyway, they were forced to storm Hamilton Hall at Columbia through a second-floor window [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=93.28s)]
*  after the rioters barricaded the building and the building entryway. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=98.88s)]
*  But the big question moving forward is, will any of these criminals, any of them, be held [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=104.12s)]
*  accountable? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=108.8s)]
*  According to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, 280 arrests were made at Columbia [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  and City College last night. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=115.28s)]
*  Of those 280 arrests, 170 perpetrators were already released with a mere summons. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=117.44s)]
*  That's basically a little more than a parking ticket or a traffic ticket. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=123.72s)]
*  The rest, they were issued a desk appearance ticket, which is typically used for low-level [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=127.92s)]
*  misdemeanors, and a few might be charged with felonies, but that is TBD, to be determined. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  In Alvin Bragg's New York, that would likely only happen to somebody with the last name [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=138.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=143.0s)]
*  So, as of right now, it appears that very few will be held accountable and are now free [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=144.0s)]
*  to continue. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=148.76s)]
*  Go right back to the rioting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=149.76s)]
*  Now, just imagine if they were Trump supporters breaking into a building, holding staff against [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=151.28s)]
*  their will. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=156.56s)]
*  Do you really think that Joe Biden would be as silent as he is now? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=157.56s)]
*  Do you think his weaponized Department of Justice, do you think the state of New York [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=161.48s)]
*  would let them go off scot-free? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=165.88s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  And keep in mind those participating in Joe Biden's Summer of Love. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=169.2s)]
*  Well, they aren't all students at Columbia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=173.56s)]
*  A professional protest consultant was apparently spotted, quote, instructing a mob of anti-Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  agitators as they were taking over Hamilton Hall. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  So how is that not a conspiracy to commit a crime? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  And last night inside of Hamilton Hall, just listen to what the police recovered. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=190.32s)]
*  Entering Hamilton Hall. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=195.64s)]
*  This is not what students bring to school. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=198.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=199.6s)]
*  This is what professionals bring to campuses and universities. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=200.6s)]
*  These are heavy industrial chains that were locked with bike locks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  And this is what we encountered on every door inside of Hamilton Hall. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=209.04s)]
*  And so in order for our emergency services group to enter into the building, they had [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=212.64s)]
*  to first cut through these chains, but also get rid of debris and barricaded doors that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=216.72s)]
*  were barricaded with refrigerators, vending machines, chairs, you name it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=226.6s)]
*  They pushed it up against those doors to try and stop us from coming in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=231.36s)]
*  Now it's not just Columbia. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=235.32s)]
*  At UT, Austin, of the 79 rioters arrested, more than half were not students at all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=236.84s)]
*  At the University of South Florida, this 39-year-old was arrested while carrying a gun at an anti-Israel [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=243.2s)]
*  riot on campus. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=249.8s)]
*  This is a recipe for disaster. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=251.68s)]
*  And yet your president, Joe Biden, is still in hiding. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=254.0s)]
*  Today only one closed-door event on his calendar, and why would he ever deviate from that rigorous [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=257.04s)]
*  schedule? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=262.24s)]
*  Biden reportedly is penciled in to give a speech and address, and he will address this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=263.24s)]
*  on May 7th. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=269.12s)]
*  He needs another, what, six whole days to prepare and rest up for it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=270.68s)]
*  And even then, I wouldn't expect much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=274.68s)]
*  Joe desperately needs the votes from the anti-Semites that are in his party, the people in Congress, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  the squad, the people that hate the Jewish people, people that hate Israel, and really [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  people that are not particularly fond of this country as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=289.0s)]
*  But we do have some good news tonight. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=292.68s)]
*  All is not lost in every corner of America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  There are many people that love this country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  We don't hear from them a lot, because, well, they have jobs and kids and lives, and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=300.04s)]
*  they're responsible. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=305.48s)]
*  But these hardworking, peace-loving Americans are everywhere. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  At the University of North Carolina, amid what is a wave of projectiles, a group of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  frat brothers, they actually rallied around the school's American flag, protecting it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=316.04s)]
*  from pro-Palestinian rioters who had already ripped the flag down once and replaced it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  with the Palestinian flag. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=326.68s)]
*  Last night, right here, right in New York City, the NYPD ripped down another Palestinian [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=328.84s)]
*  flag, threw it on the ground, returning our country's flag to its rightful place. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=339.44s)]
*  That's our flag, folks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=340.44s)]
*  It's going to take over our buildings and put another flag up. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=342.44s)]
*  That may be fine to other people, but it's not to me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  My uncle died defending this country, and these men and women put their lives on the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  line. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=356.4s)]
*  And it's despicable that schools will allow another country flag to fly in our country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  So blame me for being proud to be an American. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=364.88s)]
*  And I thank Commissioner Daughtry for putting that flag back up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=367.56s)]
*  We're not surrendering our way of life to anyone. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=371.88s)]
*  That was New York City Mayor Eric Adams filling the void left by a president who is unable [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  and unwilling to stand up for our country. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  And tonight, the hate-filled protests, they continue. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVwsmCJ65ts&t=383.96s)]
