# Sean Hannity: The Democrats didn't see this coming
**Fox News:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I)
*  All right, please make sure to keep the deep state in your thoughts tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden's State Department reportedly, they had a therapy session. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=4.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=9.6s)]
*  To help government workers cope with the election results and Donald Trump's big win. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=10.6s)]
*  I'm sure emotions are running very high. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=16.28s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to bring in comfort animals any day now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=19.18s)]
*  But tonight, we end the week with more good news for Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=22.52s)]
*  The lawfare against the president-elect in New York has officially fallen apart. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=25.56s)]
*  Earlier today, Judge Juan Mershon canceled Donald Trump's sentencing, granted his request [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  to proceed with a motion to dismiss all charges, which they should have done and they never [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=35.96s)]
*  should have been brought in the first place. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, while Trump appears to be in the clear, you just never know though, with this judge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=42.64s)]
*  and DA Bragg. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=48.32s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=49.56s)]
*  Now, coming up, we're going to show you how New York's politicized and weaponized system [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=50.56s)]
*  of justice is putting everybody in danger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=55.44s)]
*  But we begin with something very interesting you might not have noticed after the election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=58.6s)]
*  All across the country, there were many devout Democrats who were not just angry that Donald [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=63.64s)]
*  Trump won, they were also in a complete state of shock. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=68.84s)]
*  Many totally, completely blindsided by Donald Trump's resounding win in both the Electoral [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=72.72s)]
*  College and the popular vote. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=78.64s)]
*  Now, despite the disastrous last four years, the terrible approval numbers of Kamala and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=80.72s)]
*  Joe, a wave of polls, we had pollsters on regularly in favor of Donald Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=86.76s)]
*  The Democrats, what? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=94.0s)]
*  They didn't see it coming? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  The legacy media didn't see it coming? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Probably because the primary source of news is legacy media, where, look, I said in 2007, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=99.0s)]
*  journalism in America is dead. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=106.4s)]
*  It's been dead and buried, with a few exceptions like Fox News for some time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=109.44s)]
*  And it's become a far-left echo chamber. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=113.64s)]
*  That is what has emerged. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=116.52s)]
*  Political hacks at the AP, Reuters, nearly every single major newspaper, New York Times, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=118.28s)]
*  Washington Post, L.A. Times, USA Today, you know, the other two cable news outlets all [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=124.12s)]
*  repeat the same Democratic talking points day in and day out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=129.08s)]
*  Most Americans, including most of you watching tonight, you have known this for years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=133.0s)]
*  Most Americans now have tuned out the noise. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=139.27999999999997s)]
*  Now people have choices. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  First they had talk radio, Fox News. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  Now they have social media. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Then they have podcasting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  They are very selective in where they're getting their information. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=149.64s)]
*  Democrats, they just have their heads in the sand. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=153.0s)]
*  Legacy media is refusing to change course. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=156.2s)]
*  Even as their numbers decline, their influence is totally evaporated. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, take a look at this headline published just yesterday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  This on MSDNC, quote, this makes me so angry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=166.92s)]
*  Lakin Riley's killer rate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  Again, Lakin Riley's killer never stood a chance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  The guy was caught red handed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  A young nursing student with a whole life ahead of her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  And he was out stalking, looking for somebody to rape. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=185.5s)]
*  He murdered this young nursing student. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=189.92s)]
*  Her whole life ahead of her, brutally murdered by a Harris Biden unvetted illegal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=192.8s)]
*  He deserves the death penalty, not just life in jail. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  But that article seemed to blame, quote, political controversy for his conviction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=201.8s)]
*  No, it was the act of murder that convicted him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=207.52s)]
*  The brutal, evil, senseless act of murder. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=211.24s)]
*  The only political controversy here is that this criminal lowlife was even inside of our [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  country to begin with. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=220.72s)]
*  Invited by Joe Biden, in his own words, across wide open borders to our south, Kamala and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  Joe, no vetting, 12.5 million unvetted Harris Biden illegals. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=229.32s)]
*  How is it possible to become that detached from reality that you publish a headline like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=234.68s)]
*  that? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=241.88s)]
*  Why do, why do liberals, why do these extremists put so-called rights for illegals, which [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=242.88s)]
*  they don't have over your safety and your security? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=249.56s)]
*  According to a study from the Media Research Center during their prime time shows, MSDNC, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  they didn't spend a single second on the Lake and Riley trial. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Not a second. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=265.84s)]
*  You know, meanwhile, fake news CNN, they barely covered it at all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=266.84s)]
*  Quote, between the morning of November the 15th, when the trial started and Wednesday, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=271.12s)]
*  November 20th, 2 p.m., when Jose Ibarra was ultimately sentenced, fake news CNN and MSNBC's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=276.04s)]
*  prime time coverage of the case amounted to a single 161 second news brief on the Monday [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=282.8s)]
*  night edition of CNN's Laura Coats. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  I guess we should tip our hat to whoever she is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=294.88s)]
*  Illegal immigration, violent crime were two of the top issues in this election, according [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=297.92s)]
*  to almost every poll. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=302.76s)]
*  And yet, these so-called cable news outlets, networks, completely ignored a major story [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=304.12s)]
*  during their prime time coverage. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=310.96s)]
*  But by the way, they've been ignoring illegal immigration for four years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  They went along with the big lie. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, the border's secured, the border's secured, the border's closed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  We here at Fox told the country the truth. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=322.4s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=324.88s)]
*  They didn't focus on high prices, inflation, the bad economy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=325.88s)]
*  They didn't focus on higher gas prices. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  They're not looking out for all of you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=332.28s)]
*  And that's why people are leaving them in droves. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=334.96s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=337.52s)]
*  The big three networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, they dedicated about four times more coverage to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=338.7s)]
*  an insult comics dumb joke about Puerto Rico three hours before Donald Trump ever got on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  stage at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden than the Lakin Riley murder trial. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  Apparently for ABC, CBS and NBC, a bad joke from a comedian. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=360.08s)]
*  And I'll grant you, you probably shouldn't have been there. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=368.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=369.28s)]
*  They're saying that's more newsworthy than the murder of a young woman nursing student [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=370.28s)]
*  by the name of Lakin Riley at the hands of an unvetted Harris Biden illegal immigrant. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=374.64s)]
*  By the way, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of dead Americans. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  We have dozens and dozens of Americans, including children that have been raped. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=385.06s)]
*  We have thousands of Americans victims of violent crime because of Harris Biden unvetted [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  illegals. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  This is why their far left viewers were in total shock when Fox News projected that Donald [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=396.06s)]
*  Trump is the 47th president of this country. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=403.16s)]
*  The legacy media has done nothing but lie and cover for the Democratic Party. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=406.48s)]
*  And now they have no influence. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=413.12s)]
*  And while they aren't particularly outraged that young women have been murdered and a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=415.56s)]
*  lot of people raped and other people victims of violent crimes by these illegal immigrants, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=420.24s)]
*  they are so deeply troubled by Donald Trump's political appointments that gets them triggered. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=425.88s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=431.68s)]
*  The legacy media also thinks it is dangerous to celebrate Donald Trump's huge win. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  Look at this headline from Politico, quote, calling Trump's win resounding isn't just [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=439.84s)]
*  wrong, it's risky. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=445.24s)]
*  What's risky about it? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=446.24s)]
*  Just so we're clear, the state run legacy media mob allowing more than what? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=448.08s)]
*  10, 11, 12 and a half million. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=453.64s)]
*  We don't know the exact number. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=455.64s)]
*  We don't know how many gotaways. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=456.88s)]
*  But all of these people coming into our country from over 180 countries, including countries [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=458.64s)]
*  with terror ties, our top geopolitical foes, but daring to call Trump's historic win resounding [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4DowAxn_6I&t=465.28s)]
