# Sean Hannity: Biden is ‘bribing voters’
**Fox News:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc)
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity Countdown to the election in just 210 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=9.96s)]
*  Joe Biden can finally be held accountable by you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=10.96s)]
*  And despite terrible approval numbers, the president is willing to do whatever he can [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=14.56s)]
*  do to cling on to power. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=19.52s)]
*  That includes turning his back on our closest ally, the only democracy in the Middle East, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=21.6s)]
*  all in an effort to appease people in Michigan chanting, Death to America, in this specific [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=27.88s)]
*  town of Dearborn. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=34.64s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=36.2s)]
*  I love the Africa! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=37.2s)]
*  I love the Africa! [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=38.2s)]
*  I love the Africa! [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=39.2s)]
*  I love the Africa! [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=40.2s)]
*  All right, we have a lot more on the threat from within. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=41.2s)]
*  Joe's political ambition is clearly way, way more important a priority than supporting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=50.32s)]
*  an ally after the worst radical terrorist attack in their history. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=56.56s)]
*  Truly repulsive, and that's saying a lot about Joe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=62.68s)]
*  Also, Transportation Secretary, your buddy, Pothole Pete, who enjoys the personal security [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=66.0s)]
*  detail, he doesn't see a problem with crime in D.C. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=71.4s)]
*  I'm sure he's living in his nice little bubble, and one report is now calling it the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=74.48s)]
*  trendy new splurge for millennials. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=79.44s)]
*  Most of you would know it as buying groceries. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  We have a full report on the inflation crisis that is not going away under Joe Biden. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  All right, but first, if you blinked, you might have missed it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  The president was in Wisconsin today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=94.48s)]
*  He had a huge, not-so-huge speech, under 15 minutes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  On the way there, Biden nearly tripped up the short little baby stairs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=103.12s)]
*  Oh, good, Joey, good job. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=107.0s)]
*  Anyway, of Air Force One, but was thankfully able to stay upright this time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=109.84s)]
*  I remember he abandoned the big boy stairs a long time ago. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  Joe then spoke to a handful of voters about instructions that he got from his wife. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  Always listen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=123.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=124.56s)]
*  And Madison Mayor, thank you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=125.56s)]
*  Where is she? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=127.84s)]
*  There you are. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=128.84s)]
*  Stand up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=129.84s)]
*  I get instructions from my wife, who's a school teacher. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=130.84s)]
*  She said, make sure you say hello to the mayor. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=135.88s)]
*  I really like being with her. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=137.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=139.6s)]
*  Back to that fun opener by Joe. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=140.64s)]
*  Well, he got to the real purpose of his speech. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=142.64s)]
*  The president announced another bold new plan. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=145.68s)]
*  Basically, I would view it as kind of bribing voters with your tax dollars. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=149.44s)]
*  Last week, it was a $500 billion green energy spending spree full of handouts to all of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=155.0s)]
*  Joe's allies and, interestingly, a lot of swing state money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  And this week, another round of student loan forgiveness. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=165.12s)]
*  By the way, a unilateral act that the Supreme Court of our land ruled was unconstitutional. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=168.56s)]
*  But the Bidens, they never let the rule of law get in the way of a good time, paid for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=174.68s)]
*  with your money. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Tens of millions of people's debt was literally about to get canceled. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  But then some of my Republican friends and elected officials in special interests sued [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=187.44s)]
*  us and the Supreme Court blocked us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=191.04s)]
*  But that didn't, well, that didn't stop us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=194.12s)]
*  No, I mean it sincerely. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=196.72s)]
*  We continue to find alternatives past the reduced student debt payment that are not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  challengeable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  Folks, I will never stop to deliver student debt relief on hardworking Americans, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  it's only in the interest of America that we do it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=211.44s)]
*  Defy the Supreme Court of the land. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=215.44s)]
*  Pick and choose what laws to enforce, not enforce. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=217.92s)]
*  Lie to the American people that the border is closed and secure when it's not. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=221.0s)]
*  Lie to the American people about never talking to your son, your brother or anybody for that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=225.48s)]
*  matter about their foreign business deals. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=229.64s)]
*  Hmm, interesting life of Joe Biden. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=232.6s)]
*  Now, if successful, this will be a massive transfer of wealth from Americans that did [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=235.16s)]
*  not go to college to 30 million people that have college degrees, including those that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=241.72s)]
*  attended graduate school. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=247.92s)]
*  They're the ones that put their signature to pay back the loan on it, not the rest of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=249.76s)]
*  you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=254.2s)]
*  And in case you're wondering, there is no income cap on this round of student loan forgiveness. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  In other words, a welder, maybe makes 60, 70 grand a year, will soon be paying the student [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  loan of a tenured sociology professor, for example, making 250 grand. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=266.28s)]
*  That sound fair to you? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=273.28s)]
*  Is that the definition of fairness? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the colleges, the universities win either way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=276.24s)]
*  Joe will never hold them accountable for jacking up prices year after year after year, because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=279.96s)]
*  as it turns out, the whole Middle Class Joe Act, that was all a big lie, too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=284.8s)]
*  Now, even some Democrats are having a hard time stomaching Joe Biden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=290.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=294.72s)]
*  I wouldn't go out there and extol the miracle of the Biden economy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=295.72s)]
*  It just drives me crazy when he does that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=303.0s)]
*  President Biden doesn't talk about the wars very often, should he? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=305.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  Not just in Israel, Ukraine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  We have superpower. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  He is the commander in chief. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=313.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=315.68s)]
*  He should speak out more. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=316.68s)]
*  And also, we should cover what he's saying, because often when he speaks, nobody listens. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=317.76s)]
*  Let's see, Donna Brazile, David Axelrod, James Carville. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=323.64s)]
*  Let's see, Van Jones, Maureen Dab. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=327.8s)]
*  A lot of prominent Democratic voices don't like Joe. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=329.76s)]
*  Privately, most Democrats have been frustrated with Biden for years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=333.24s)]
*  Remember, Obama himself famously looked down on Joe, warning, quote, never underestimate [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=337.12s)]
*  Joe's ability to f things up. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=342.42s)]
*  In 2016, Biden was passed over to be Obama's successor, despite all of her glaring problems. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  Even Hillary Clinton at the time was considered a better choice than Joe. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=351.14s)]
*  In reality, very few people actually like Joe Biden. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=355.98s)]
*  It's clear his family is not telling him the truth about probably it would be a good [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=360.06s)]
*  idea to retire. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=363.78s)]
*  He's been a horrible president for this country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=365.78s)]
*  He's in way over his head, always has been. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=368.26s)]
*  And he's trying to get by, win re-election, by handing out your money and smearing Donald [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  Trump and lying about abortion and calling Republicans racist and sexist and all the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=377.3s)]
*  other names they call conservatives and Republicans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, earlier today, President Trump announced his position on abortion, and he rightly believes, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=385.38s)]
*  if you believe in the Constitution, that it should be left up to the states and for the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=391.38s)]
*  people in every state to decide. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=395.42s)]
*  That is called, oh, democracy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=398.3s)]
*  That is called states' rights, for example. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=400.58s)]
*  It's something Democrats claim to love and revere. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  Not true. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=406.85999999999996s)]
*  Trump emphasized that, as president, he will respect every state's decision. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=407.85999999999996s)]
*  Gavin Newsom said in the debate with Ron DeSantis right here on this program, when I had to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=412.5s)]
*  press him again and again and again, do you support abortion on demand in months 7, 8 [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=416.94s)]
*  and 9, he finally answered and said, that should be a decision between a doctor, a woman [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=422.74s)]
*  and their conscience. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=428.62s)]
*  So no restrictions. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=430.22s)]
*  Now, Trump made it clear, he made it unequivocal, there will be no national abortion ban under [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=431.62s)]
*  his administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=437.06s)]
*  In response, the Biden campaign, they do what they always do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=438.62s)]
*  They just flat-out lied, telling supporters that Donald Trump has a secret plan to ban [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwmsuFTQVVc&t=441.70000000000005s)]
