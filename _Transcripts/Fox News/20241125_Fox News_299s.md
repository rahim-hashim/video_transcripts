# Democrats ‘overplayed’ their hand, says legal analyst
**Fox News:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM)
*  Here with reaction to all this news tonight, Fox News, legal analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I'm watching the reaction, and I think all the stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=3.6s)]
*  I learned a lesson, Greg, and I've told you this before. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=7.28s)]
*  When I was in Atlanta and I was on the air, I didn't know Richard Jewell, who's accused [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=10.48s)]
*  of being the lone bomber. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=16.62s)]
*  He fit the profile of the lone bomber because he lived with his mother. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=18.6s)]
*  And I was on the air at the time, had no idea he was listening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=22.36s)]
*  And I learned later that I was the only person he ever heard say, wait a minute, maybe he's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=25.32s)]
*  trying to save money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=30.0s)]
*  You know, maybe that does not make a terrorist out of somebody. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=31.6s)]
*  And then throughout my career between vetting Obama when nobody else would, the Russiagate, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=35.36s)]
*  you were a big part of our team, along with Sarah Carter, John Solomon, Catherine Herridge [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=41.44s)]
*  at the time, so many others. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=46.2s)]
*  I can't even name everybody. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=47.8s)]
*  But we unpeeled every layer of that onion, and it took us three years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=50.0s)]
*  Then we have FISA abuse, and we got to the bottom of that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=54.0s)]
*  Then we, you know, we got to the bottom of impeachment one, impeachment two, all of this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=57.56s)]
*  lawfare. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=61.52s)]
*  But also, there were other cases. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=62.52s)]
*  We were right on this program on Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  We were right on Freddie Gray Baltimore. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=67.92s)]
*  I was right about Duke Lacrosse, because I took the time to go meet with family members, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=69.84s)]
*  and I knew they had exculpatory evidence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=74.08s)]
*  Right about UVA. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And I can continue. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=78.0s)]
*  The reason legacy media is failing is because they rush to judgment constantly, and they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=80.04s)]
*  always get it wrong. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  And they've been wrong about Donald Trump, and they'll never apologize or acknowledge. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  I know a long statement leading into you, but how does this end? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, it ends poorly for Democrats. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=99.04s)]
*  They overplayed their hand. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, their eight-year-old lawfare campaign that began with a Russia hoax and ended with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  these federal cases backfired on them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  People resented it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=113.48s)]
*  They saw Trump as a victim, not a villain. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=114.64s)]
*  And you know, these two federal cases are so typical. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=118.92s)]
*  They should never have been brought. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=122.08s)]
*  No fair or neutral prosecutor would have done it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=124.04s)]
*  They were purely political, legally anemic. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=126.48s)]
*  They were based on untested legal theories that were dubious at best, and constitutional [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  roadblocks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=137.12s)]
*  The Supreme Court blew a big hole in the J-6 case on immunity grounds, but they also said [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=138.28s)]
*  obstruction charges you're using, you are misusing them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=143.0s)]
*  In the end, there was really nothing left of Smith's cases, especially since the Florida [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=148.2s)]
*  judge tossed the documents prosecution because the special counsel himself was unconstitutionally [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=153.08s)]
*  appointed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=160.44s)]
*  So Jack Smith now goes down in history, I think, as the poster child for failed, biased prosecutors [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=161.44s)]
*  their power, and it's a huge defeat for corrupt lawfare and a big win for Americans in our [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=170.4s)]
*  system of justice, Sean. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=176.52s)]
*  And it also, I think, convicts the legacy media because they were complicit the whole [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=179.28s)]
*  way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=184.36s)]
*  They wouldn't even vet Kamala Harris. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=185.36s)]
*  They had 100 days to do so. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=187.16s)]
*  I think this channel mostly, nobody, I don't think anybody else more than me played Kamala [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=189.88s)]
*  in her own words. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=196.36s)]
*  They wouldn't even do that and inform their viewers or listeners. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's so rudimentary and fundamental. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  What does it tell you about media today? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=203.8s)]
*  Well, it tells us that the media is lost. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  They have forgotten their role to be fair and unbiased, neutral, to tell both sides [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=211.96s)]
*  of the story. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=218.52s)]
*  They have become activists with an agenda, and many of them readily say, openly, that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=219.76s)]
*  our job is to serve as the resistance to Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=229.16s)]
*  Smith's misbegotten cases are so typical of how the media mishandled them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=235.64s)]
*  Smith knew that this would happen, which is why he unscrupulously tried to rush the prosecutions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=242.04s)]
*  before the election. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  And when he failed, then he attempted to harm Trump's chances at the ballot box by releasing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=250.48s)]
*  to the public damaging documents right before the election. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=255.92s)]
*  They were one-sided. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=260.08s)]
*  They were exaggerated. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=261.08s)]
*  He violated DOJ rules. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=262.08s)]
*  The media let him get away with it, and so did the judge. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=265.96s)]
*  She said, oh, well, this is irregular, but I'm going to endorse it and let you do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=268.88s)]
*  Smith didn't care about the law and procedure, and neither did the media. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=273.96s)]
*  They misrepresented it time and again because they had an agenda. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=277.44s)]
*  My warning to conservatives is there might be a desire to get back at them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  We can't become them, and we have to reject this outright, clean it all up so it can't [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=288.6s)]
*  happen again, and restore constitutional order. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=294.36s)]
*  Greg Jared, thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8iVP9O-MLM&t=297.72s)]
