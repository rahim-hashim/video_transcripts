# AOC's DNC speech 'didn't make any sense': Dana Perino
**Fox News:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60)
*  That's AOC on the stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=0.0s)]
*  About six minutes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=2.0s)]
*  Six minutes. We welcome our good friend, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=4.0s)]
*  our dear friend. We've got four great [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=6.0s)]
*  shows here at Fox. Of course, the hit show [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=8.0s)]
*  The Five. And [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm watching America's Newsroom every morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=12.0s)]
*  Are you? Of course I am. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=14.0s)]
*  Thank you. And I'm going to be [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=16.0s)]
*  on with you guys on Thursday. I know, I'm excited. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=18.0s)]
*  And our friend Charlie Heard is here as well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=20.0s)]
*  You know, this is important to me. I was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=22.0s)]
*  watching AOC and I thought it was important [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=24.0s)]
*  to run it because I used to say about AOC [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=26.0s)]
*  she was the Speaker of the House [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=28.0s)]
*  and Nancy was Speaker in Name Only. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=30.0s)]
*  Now, this has now come full [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=32.0s)]
*  circle. Think about this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=34.0s)]
*  Because here is the sponsor [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=36.0s)]
*  of the 93 trillion dollar [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=38.0s)]
*  radical communist socialist [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=40.0s)]
*  use whatever name you want, Green New Deal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=42.0s)]
*  And Kamala co-sponsored [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=44.0s)]
*  that bill in the Senate with Bernie [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=46.0s)]
*  Sanders like she co-sponsored [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=48.0s)]
*  Medicare for All, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=50.0s)]
*  Universal Health Care, which would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=52.0s)]
*  eliminate private health insurance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=54.0s)]
*  That is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=56.0s)]
*  this new radicalized [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=58.0s)]
*  Democratic Party that they're trying to hide [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=60.0s)]
*  from. Is that why they? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=62.0s)]
*  I found that whole thing totally [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=64.0s)]
*  bizarre in a way. But first of all, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=66.0s)]
*  she's a great speaker. She had the crowd [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=68.0s)]
*  hype. For the most part, Democrats always [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=70.0s)]
*  talk over the speakers. They [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=72.0s)]
*  listened to her. And [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=74.0s)]
*  she is a great opening act. Because I was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=76.0s)]
*  a bartender too. Maybe they one day, oh, they'll [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=78.0s)]
*  listen to me. I was a great waitress as well. But it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=80.0s)]
*  also seemed very disconnected to reality. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=82.0s)]
*  She was talking as if Biden and Harris [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=84.0s)]
*  hadn't been in office for the last three and a half [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=86.0s)]
*  years. She was talking about people having to go back to work [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=88.0s)]
*  because they couldn't afford things. I'm like, yeah, well, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=90.0s)]
*  when did that happen? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=92.0s)]
*  Right? And she's talking about immigrant [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=94.0s)]
*  families starting out and how Kamala Harris [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=96.0s)]
*  is their personal. Yes, yes, we know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=98.0s)]
*  Yes, that's absolutely true. She [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=100.0s)]
*  also is talking about [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=102.0s)]
*  how non-college [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=104.0s)]
*  educated workers. Like, well, Donald [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=106.0s)]
*  Trump has all those voters now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=108.0s)]
*  He has the rural vote. They are now [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=110.0s)]
*  the party of the elite. And then she said [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=112.0s)]
*  President Trump just wants [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=114.0s)]
*  to do things for his friends on Wall Street. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=116.0s)]
*  As far as I can tell, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=118.0s)]
*  he doesn't have any friends on Wall Street. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=120.0s)]
*  That's a good point. I don't understand [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=122.0s)]
*  what she was saying. It was a great speech, but [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=124.0s)]
*  it didn't make any sense. That's really [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=126.0s)]
*  a great analysis. Well said. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=128.0s)]
*  I think they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=130.0s)]
*  tapped into something that's really true. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=132.0s)]
*  And that is, I know they're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=134.0s)]
*  hiding their Hollywood friends. There'll be a few [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=136.0s)]
*  of them here, but not many. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=138.0s)]
*  I know they're kicking people out of a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=140.0s)]
*  diner so that they can put their friends [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=142.0s)]
*  in their place rather than talk to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=144.0s)]
*  everyday people. And I love [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=146.0s)]
*  diners. When I was done [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=148.0s)]
*  finishing closing the bar at 4 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=150.0s)]
*  30 and cleaning it, when [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=152.0s)]
*  I was 17, 18, 19 years old, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=154.0s)]
*  I would head straight to the diner [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=156.0s)]
*  and read the local newspaper. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=158.0s)]
*  But the point is, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=160.0s)]
*  everything about this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=162.0s)]
*  is phony. Everything about her [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=164.0s)]
*  is now phony. It is contrived. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=166.0s)]
*  It is not real. It is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=168.0s)]
*  the opposite of everything she has now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=170.0s)]
*  stated and stood for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=172.0s)]
*  for the last five [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=174.0s)]
*  years. How is that? Yeah. And it's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=176.0s)]
*  never more comical than when she says [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=178.0s)]
*  on day one. You're like, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=180.0s)]
*  wait a minute. I did the math and it's day [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=182.0s)]
*  1460, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=184.0s)]
*  I think, that you'll be president [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=186.0s)]
*  if you win. And you're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=188.0s)]
*  right. The last thing that she [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=190.0s)]
*  wants, the vice president wants to do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=192.0s)]
*  is to run on a record. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=194.0s)]
*  And I agree with you, Dana, that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=196.0s)]
*  AOC is a wonderful speaker. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=198.0s)]
*  She's a great hype person. She's got [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=200.0s)]
*  everybody on the edge of their [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=202.0s)]
*  seats. But I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=204.0s)]
*  that it's almost a little bit of a problem because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=206.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris does not command [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=208.0s)]
*  that kind of attention in a speech. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=210.0s)]
*  She can read a teleprompter very well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=212.0s)]
*  But it's not the same [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=214.0s)]
*  as what we just saw right there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=216.0s)]
*  And I think that's a poor [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=218.0s)]
*  comparison for the vice president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=220.0s)]
*  But was it a kind of unimaginable [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=222.0s)]
*  when AOC came out with the Green New Deal? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=224.0s)]
*  Like, there was a part of us that laughed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=226.0s)]
*  93 trillion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=228.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=230.0s)]
*  That's a good point. When you think about how [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=232.0s)]
*  the Biden-Harris administration [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=234.0s)]
*  raided the Medicare trust fund [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=236.0s)]
*  in order to help pay for electric vehicle [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=238.0s)]
*  tax credits for rich people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=240.0s)]
*  And you know, President Trump, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=242.0s)]
*  he is going to have to drive home this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=244.0s)]
*  message. The media is not going to do it for him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=246.0s)]
*  Explain that in more [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=248.0s)]
*  very specific detail because I was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=250.0s)]
*  asking [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=252.0s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, our replace [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=254.0s)]
*  Ramaswamy earlier. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=256.0s)]
*  I think the most effective ads will be Kamala [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=258.0s)]
*  and Tim Walz in their own words. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=260.0s)]
*  100%. And I think that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=262.0s)]
*  Dave McCormick, the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=264.0s)]
*  Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=266.0s)]
*  was one of the first to do an ad [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=268.0s)]
*  when she was going to be the nominee. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=270.0s)]
*  All that they did was they just put together all [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=272.0s)]
*  of these sound bites of her in her [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=274.0s)]
*  own words. It's the most effective thing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=276.0s)]
*  But you've got to be out there driving it. The media [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=278.0s)]
*  is not going to do it for them. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=280.0s)]
*  They have 78 days to just coast. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=282.0s)]
*  Well, it's actually less. We consider early [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJxnPgeEI60&t=284.0s)]
