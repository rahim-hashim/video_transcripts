# Marco Rubio: Liberals are 'playing with fire'
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw)
*  All right, welcome back to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=0.0s)]
*  On Friday, a federal judge in Illinois ruled that illegal immigrants have gun rights protected [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=2.32s)]
*  by the Second Amendment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=7.5s)]
*  Well, they were saying that while a ban on illegal immigrants owning guns is constitutional [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=8.5s)]
*  on its face, there is no precedent that allows the government to deprive an illegal immigrant [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  who has never been convicted of a violent crime from owning a gun. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=18.92s)]
*  Also tonight, a big win for the state of Texas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Now today, the Supreme Court is now allowing the state to enforce the state of Texas and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=25.64s)]
*  police there to arrest suspected illegal immigrants while a challenge to the law plays out in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=31.76s)]
*  an appeals court. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=37.64s)]
*  Here with reaction, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is back with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=38.64s)]
*  Senator, great to have you as always. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=41.64s)]
*  Let me get this straight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=43.08s)]
*  By the very nature of their presence in the United States, if you don't respect our [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=44.78s)]
*  laws, borders and sovereignty, you are here illegally. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=48.2s)]
*  Okay, you're not a citizen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=51.52s)]
*  You don't have constitutional rights like a U.S. citizen, do you? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=54.2s)]
*  Well, this is a ruling by an Obama-appointed judge, I believe. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  And look, what they're trying to do is blur the line between citizenship and everything [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=62.28s)]
*  else, people that are here illegally. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=65.76s)]
*  And so you've seen cities, for example, make an effort to allow people that are in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=67.88s)]
*  this country illegally, that aren't even citizens, to vote. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=71.36s)]
*  This is another example in this case. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=74.76s)]
*  And you almost wonder if it's not being done to sort of mock both gun laws and also the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=76.12s)]
*  whole understanding of the value of being a citizen of the United States of America. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=81.08s)]
*  There has to be a distinction between citizenship and non-citizenship, between being legally [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=84.84s)]
*  here and not legally here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=89.32s)]
*  If there's no distinction between being here legally or illegally, and there's no [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  distinction between being a citizen or not being a citizen, then what's the point of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=94.12s)]
*  even having citizenship? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  What's the point of even having immigration laws? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  And this is just one more mockery that we're finding in our court system. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=101.28s)]
*  Luckily, I expect that this is going to be appealed and overturned at some point, because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=104.12s)]
*  it's an absurd outcome. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=109.36s)]
*  Well, can you explain this? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=110.36s)]
*  The New York Post had this today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=112.36s)]
*  Biden knows that terrorists are crossing the border. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=113.96s)]
*  And we know we're catching people on the terror watch list, even from our northern [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=117.44s)]
*  border now, a significant number of them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Then you have tens of thousands of people coming from Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Egypt, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=131.92s)]
*  So they know terrorists are coming into the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=133.2s)]
*  And Joe Biden is not only allowing it and not enforcing the law, but he's facilitating [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=136.28s)]
*  the lawbreaking and aiding and abetting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, can you explain that to me? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=143.96s)]
*  Because I would argue it's not if, it's when, one of these terror cells is going to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  attack this country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  And maybe it'll be as significant as 9-11 or maybe worse. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=153.74s)]
*  And if that day comes and he allowed that to happen, he will have that blood on his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=157.68s)]
*  hands. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=162.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=163.72s)]
*  It's inevitable that something horrific will happen in this country as a result of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=164.88s)]
*  our open border. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=168.32s)]
*  It's only a matter of time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=169.32s)]
*  I would say a couple things that I wouldn't focus too much on the terror watch list, because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=170.32s)]
*  that's not a comprehensive list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  That's just a list of people we know are wanted for links to terrorism. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=175.2s)]
*  But it is notâ€”there's trafficking networks that operate all over the world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, so we know that there are trafficking networks with ties to ISIS and al-Qaeda and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=181.96s)]
*  others who, as a business, as a way to generate money, they move migrants to the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=185.84s)]
*  Now, you're telling me that they own this business. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=190.92s)]
*  They move people across the border who are not terrorists, and they're not willing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=192.7s)]
*  to move some of their own into this country? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=196.14s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=197.82s)]
*  It's just common sense and it's logical that if you're a terrorist, you're trying [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=198.82s)]
*  to get into America in order to conduct an attack, you know that you can do it by simply [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=202.17999999999998s)]
*  crossing the border. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=206.28s)]
*  And you can do it with fake documents and passports that you can buy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=207.28s)]
*  And there's no way we can verify that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  You can't call some of these places and verify if that person is really who they say [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=212.94s)]
*  they are. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=216.26s)]
*  And it's actually a real document. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=217.26s)]
*  It's not really the person, but it's a real document that they bribe someone to produce [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=218.62s)]
*  from them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=222.0s)]
*  So I think the dangerâ€”they're playing with fire here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=223.0s)]
*  It's only a matter of time before something terrible happens. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  And you ask me, why are they doing this? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=228.36s)]
*  Because there is an element of the Democratic Party that believes in open borders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=230.52s)]
*  They do not believe thatâ€”they believe people should be allowed to live anywhere in the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=234.24s)]
*  world they want to live. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=237.44s)]
*  That's what they believe, and that no country should be able to prevent people from coming [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  in and out as they please. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=242.44s)]
*  They believe these things. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=243.8s)]
*  Some of them even admit that they believe these things. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's a big part of the Democratic base. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=247.56s)]
*  And he's afraid to lose their support. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=250.72s)]
*  He's already lost the pro-Hamas people, and now he's afraid to lose these guys. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=251.92s)]
*  Well, and what was the result of that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=256.12s)]
*  The result of that was, in the middle of a war, our chief ally, Israel, thrown down the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=259.08s)]
*  stairs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=264.12s)]
*  In the middle of a war, they are now calling for elections in Israel to now make what is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=265.12s)]
*  a fight for their survival even that much more harder politically. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  I can't even fathom a lack of loyalty and friendship. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=274.44s)]
*  They stood by us after 9-11. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=279.22s)]
*  All they are looking for is us to stand by them and support them in their right to win [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=281.26s)]
*  their war on terror. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Senator, you know a lot more about TikTok than I do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=287.42s)]
*  You have seen a lot more intelligence than I have seen on the issue of TikTok. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  I listen very closely when people like you and Josh Hawley and some others talk about [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=294.06s)]
*  TikTok and it being a spying mechanism of the communist Chinese. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=298.82s)]
*  I believe you when you say it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=302.26s)]
*  I would not have a problem if Elon Musk or Larry Ellison, whoever, an American or somebody [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  that would remove those spy applications from that site, if they were to buy that from the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  communist Chinese that only own a part of it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=321.54s)]
*  What makes you so convinced it's a spy mechanism and why is it imperative that the American [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=324.3s)]
*  people understand this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=330.54s)]
*  Well, TikTok is not the issue. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  TikTok is a company, it's a social media app. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=334.62s)]
*  That app is powered by an algorithm that picks the videos you see. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=336.62s)]
*  It literally reads your mind and it knows what you like before you even know you like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=339.94s)]
*  it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  It picks the videos, it drives the content. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the golden goose of the whole operation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=346.3s)]
*  That's owned by a company named ByteDance. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  That company, ByteDance, is a Chinese company. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't care who's on the board of directors, I don't care who their shareholders are. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=353.54s)]
*  Every company in China has to comply with the 2017 national security law of China and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=357.12s)]
*  that law says, you must do, you must give us the data and you must do with your algorithm [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  whatever we tell you to do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=367.66s)]
*  And if the Chinese Communist Party goes to ByteDance and says, we want you to change [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  the TikTok algorithm so that Americans will not be willing to defend Taiwan or surrender [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=373.38000000000005s)]
*  to China on this and that or poison the minds of young Americans over a long period of time [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  so that their society crumbles. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=383.98s)]
*  If they tell them that they have to do that, ByteDance will have to do that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=385.58000000000004s)]
*  They will do that and you will not be able to perceive it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=388.86s)]
*  So it doesn't even matter where you store the data because those engineers at ByteDance [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=392.06s)]
*  have to have access to that data in order for the algorithm to work. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=395.38s)]
*  And so what I support is saying, TikTok can continue. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=398.94s)]

*  ByteDance has to be sold to a company that's not in China and not subject to the national [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=403.62s)]

*  That's what we're trying to achieve here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWbErGFWBw&t=409.58s)]
