# 'UNHOLY': Democratsâ€™ education alliance is about to end
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM)
*  But we begin tonight with Linda McMahon, the 13th and possibly the very last secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=0.0s)]
*  of education. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=5.16s)]
*  That department was formed in 1979. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=6.58s)]
*  Now, the Department of Education days are now officially numbered. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=8.64s)]
*  And after President Trump signed a sweeping executive order to dismantle the Department [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=13.26s)]
*  of Education once and for all, take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Today, we take a very historic action that was 45 years in the making. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=20.52s)]
*  In a few moments, I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the Federal Department [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=26.6s)]
*  of Education once and for all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=32.32s)]
*  Everybody knows it's right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=35.78s)]
*  And the Democrats know it's right, and I hope they're going to be voting for it because [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=37.92s)]
*  ultimately it may come before them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=41.86s)]
*  But everybody knows it's right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=43.88s)]
*  And we have to get our children educated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=46.6s)]
*  We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=49.64s)]
*  time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=55.96s)]
*  And we're pleased to be joined today by the woman who I chose because she's an extraordinary [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=56.96s)]
*  person. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=63.32s)]
*  And hopefully she will be our last secretary of education, Linda McMahon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=65.06s)]
*  Linda. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=69.76s)]
*  All right, huge Trump derangement syndrome and the predictable meltdown from the left [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=70.76s)]
*  in three, two, one, hit it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=75.66s)]
*  They're just taking opportunity away from kids that don't have it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=78.92s)]
*  So billionaires, kids and billionaires, they have it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=82.44s)]
*  They go to private schools. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=85.36s)]
*  Everyone else, 90 percent, go to public schools. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Don't take away their opportunity. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=90.56s)]
*  Sue, let's stay on the facts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=92.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=93.84s)]
*  No, do not apologize. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=94.84s)]
*  I'm really angry about this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=95.84s)]
*  No, because this is what keeps me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=96.84s)]
*  I'm really angry. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=97.84s)]
*  Oh, really angry. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=98.84s)]
*  That was Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=100.56s)]
*  Now, she's the leader of one of the largest teachers unions in the country, quivering [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  with rage and despair, all because federal dollars earmarked for education will go directly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  to the states instead of the Department of Education. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, I have never seen her express that kind of outrage, that the Department [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  of Education has failed, systemically failed to improve test scores since its creation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  in 1979, despite dramatic and massive increases in funding year after year after year after [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=129.82s)]
*  year over three trillion dollars in systemic failure. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  In fact, in 2023, U.S. reading and math scores dropped to the lowest level in decades. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  And look at this chart. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=146.82s)]
*  SAT scores also plummeting, despite high school graduation rates. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=147.82s)]
*  That means an increasing number of students are basically being handed high school diplomas [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=153.14s)]
*  without actually becoming proficient in core fundamental subjects. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=157.62s)]
*  But no tears then from Randi Weingarten, no demands that her teachers step up, no merit [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=162.62s)]
*  pay for teachers, no choice or vouchers for parents, nope, just more money from the Department [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=168.62s)]
*  of Education for that institution. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=174.02s)]
*  When you do the same thing over and over and over again and you expect a different result, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=177.74s)]
*  what do we call that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=182.62s)]
*  The definition of insanity. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=183.74s)]
*  But Randi Weingarten, other union leaders, the Democratic Party, they never ever seem [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  to care about the results of your children. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  Finally, this unholy alliance, as I call it, between teachers unions and the Democrats, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=193.34s)]
*  the ones that, the unions that donate a fortune to Democrats every two and four years, officially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=198.62s)]
*  will be broken. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  And as you can see, they are only worried about the flow of money. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  They're not worried, they're not passionate, they're not screaming, they're not hemming [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  and hawing about their massive failure to educate our children. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=214.6s)]
*  The federal government writes big checks, the union organized support and donations [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  for Democrats, and our students, your kids, they get left behind with no accountability [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=224.98s)]
*  at all whatsoever. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, most of the money isn't even getting to teachers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  Instead, administrative costs have exploded in the past several decades. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  But thanks to President Trump, this corrupt system, it is all about to change. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=239.88s)]
*  States, local school districts, parents will have more freedom, and by cutting out the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=243.82s)]
*  middleman at the Department of Education, they might even get more money. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=248.56s)]
*  And their massive failure to educate your kids, that will come to an end. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=252.8s)]
*  But let's be clear, money alone does not improve education. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=257.12s)]
*  If you look around the country, this is interesting, some of the worst performing school districts [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=260.48s)]
*  also spend the most money per student. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=264.96s)]
*  Example, case in point, New York allocates more than $36,000 per student, the highest [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=267.64s)]
*  in the country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=274.82s)]
*  New York's test scores in reading and math rank near the bottom. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=276.06s)]
*  In contrast, according to one report, quote, over the past 20 years, Idaho, they have outperformed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=280.72s)]
*  New York in fourth grade math, eighth grade math, eighth grade reading, and Idaho averages [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=286.84s)]
*  just over one-third of what New York is spending per student year over year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=292.54s)]
*  And meanwhile, Washington, D.C., they spend the second most per student, but they rank [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=297.4s)]
*  50th, that's dead last, in eighth grade math and 45th in reading. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=302.28s)]
*  And let's not forget about the city of Baltimore, which spends well above the national average [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=309.4s)]
*  of more than $23,000 per student. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  But these are the results. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=316.56s)]
*  Twenty-three Baltimore school districts, 23, not a single student, not one proficient in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=318.24s)]
*  math, not one student in 23 schools. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=324.56s)]
*  How can any honest Democrat look at that and support the status quo? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  Entire communities are being failed by the status quo. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=334.7s)]
*  Randy Weingarten, other union bosses, they're getting paid well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Democrats get elected. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=343.38s)]
*  They're fine with the system. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=344.38s)]
*  But your students, our kids, never learn how to read, write, do math, learn history, science, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=345.96s)]
*  computers, in other words, develop the skills that are needed for a career and a productive [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  life. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  Education is the ladder to success in America. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=359.08s)]
*  Teachers, unions and Democrats have failed your children spectacularly. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=361.08s)]
*  If you tried, you couldn't even fail. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=366.44s)]
*  You know, in Reagan's term in 1980, they did a landmark study, it was called The Nation [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=368.48s)]
*  at Risk, and it literally determined what has happened to our educational system were [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=373.24s)]
*  done by an outside entity or force would be tantamount to an act of war. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=378.76s)]
*  And you know what's especially bad? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=384.36s)]
*  In the majority blue states and blue cities, Democrats have never lifted a finger to help [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=386.26s)]
*  these kids, as long as they get their campaign donations every two and four years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=391.54s)]
*  In the 1980s, a principal at an inner-city high school in Patterson, New Jersey, his [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  name Joe Lewis Clark, gained nationwide fame for bringing order and discipline and education [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  to a school once wrought with nothing but chaos and violence and drugs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=408.62s)]
*  And Clark even inspired the 1989 movie. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=413.52s)]
*  Morgan Freeman at his best, lean on me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QSAZ5fzIEM&t=416.74s)]
