# Jonathan Turley: These are glaring errors in the NY v. Trump case
**Fox News:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI)
*  Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I labeled a few of the areas that I've identified that President Trump should appeal. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=3.0s)]
*  I think because of the circumstances and the severity of the conflicts in this case and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=10.48s)]
*  constitutional issues that are at hand here, it should be expedited. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=16.14s)]
*  I think the American people have a right to know if it's going to be overturned before [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=20.52s)]
*  the election. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=24.32s)]
*  I would urge Trump's attorneys to pursue every avenue to get there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=26.18s)]
*  What would you advise them? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=30.34s)]
*  Well, I think they are going to pursue every avenue. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=32.14s)]
*  I must say I do not hold out much hope that the Supreme Court will allow them to go directly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=35.86s)]
*  to the highest court for review. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=43.14s)]
*  The reason is that the Supreme Court previously turned down Jack Smith, who wanted to expedite [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=45.78s)]
*  his own prosecution of Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=52.1s)]
*  And I think that some of the justices are going to want to stay within that same lane. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=54.74s)]
*  Now, that means it goes through the New York criminal system, and many of us don't have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=59.54s)]
*  a lot of faith after this trial in that system. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=65.02s)]
*  I think that initially, at least, he may have some tough going. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  But I have to tell you, I think that these errors are rather glaring and obvious. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine this verdict being sustained on review. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=79.66s)]
*  It just may take a while. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=84.3s)]
*  It may occur later. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it may not occur until they get to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=87.82s)]
*  But I think the Trump campaign has to assume that it will not get a final review before [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  the election. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=95.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=96.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=97.86s)]
*  So we have July 11th sentencing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=98.86s)]
*  Somebody — it's a class, what, EV felony. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=102.9s)]
*  We had the upcharge, of course, the novel legal theory that we spoke so often about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=107.14s)]
*  We have somebody that's never been convicted before. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=112.7s)]
*  Usually, I would think that somebody would be released on their own recognizance pending [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=116.14s)]
*  appeal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=121.38s)]
*  I suspect anything is possible with Judge Mershon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=123.02s)]
*  Will he try to put him in jail and have him miss his own Republican convention? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=127.38s)]
*  Is he going to have home confinement as part of this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=133.9s)]
*  You know, how far does he go? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=138.1s)]
*  Well, before I sat in that courtroom, I would have said that all of these options were almost [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=141.33999999999997s)]
*  fanciful. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=148.61999999999998s)]
*  I was really surprised. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  And what I saw in that courtroom, I felt that the judge was dead wrong on a number of his [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  decisions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  He ruled very heavily towards the prosecution. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  Even liberal legal analysts have admitted to that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  But to — first of all, to sentence him to jail ultimately as an elderly first offender [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=165.5s)]
*  in a nonviolent crime would be just such a huge departure from the norm in Manhattan [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=170.9s)]
*  and other courts that I think that even many liberals would object, that they would say [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=178.06s)]
*  that that's — that you're adding to this notion of a special criminal system just for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=184.22s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=190.58s)]
*  It's bad enough that they effectively created a crime for him, zapping a dead misdemeanor [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  into life and coming up with this rather novel theory. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  In terms of any sentence being imposed before appeal, I would hope that Judge Mershon would [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  suspend it or allow the appeal to go forward. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=210.82000000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of options here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  If he doesn't go with a jail sentence, which I think would be absurd, there's community [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=215.66000000000003s)]
*  service, there's home confinement. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=220.82s)]
*  In most of these cases, I think you would have a conditional dismissal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=223.54s)]
*  The type of go out and sin no more, you're on probation or parole and you're under court [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=228.5s)]
*  review. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=235.38s)]
*  I think that's what most judges would view a case of this kind. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=236.98s)]
*  But nothing that has happened in this case is how things are usually done in the criminal [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=240.42s)]
*  justice system, in my view. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan Turley. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=250.34s)]
*  We'll see soon enough, only a few days before the Republican National Convention. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=251.34s)]
*  This will be interesting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7LBp9usgI&t=255.54000000000002s)]
