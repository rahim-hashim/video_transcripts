# Sean Hannity: Democrats don't care about the people who make America great
**Fox News:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A)
*  And tonight we begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=0.0s)]
*  It is another good night for Republicans. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=2.72s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump has announced his new pick for attorney general. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=5.36s)]
*  That is Pam Bondi. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=8.9s)]
*  Now, this is a terrific nomination for many, many reasons. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=9.9s)]
*  Now, Pam worked as a prosecutor for nearly two decades, was the first woman elected—two-time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=13.76s)]
*  elected—attorney general, the great state of Florida, where she served for eight years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=19.76s)]
*  Pam Bondi, known for being tough on crime, worked hard to curb drug trafficking, pill [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=24.48s)]
*  mills in Florida, and during her tenure, Florida became one of the safest states in the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=29.52s)]
*  Florida's balance of freedom and security is a big reason why people like me and so [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=35.84s)]
*  many others have decided to move to the great free state of Florida in the past decade. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=41.04s)]
*  Now, as we continue, of course, during the election, one of the top concerns for voters [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=45.92s)]
*  was rising crime, wasn't it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  You have small towns, big cities all across the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=52.16s)]
*  This nomination is a clear sign that President-elect Trump intends to make good on his promise to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=55.36s)]
*  make America safe again. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=60.72s)]
*  If you need any more evidence than that, Pam Bondi will do a great job. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=63.12s)]
*  Take a look at the reaction at MSDNC. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=67.28s)]
*  Kind of priceless, actually. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=70.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=72.08s)]
*  Pam Bondi is exactly what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=73.76s)]
*  because she's competent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=77.6s)]
*  We may not agree with her ideologically, but she actually knows how to do this job. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=79.28s)]
*  So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=83.76s)]
*  well, maybe Matt Gaetz will screw this up and that'll give us some time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=87.84s)]
*  No, Pam Bondi knows what she's doing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=90.72s)]
*  She is a dangerous and effective pick, and that's, frankly, worse than what we would [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=92.56s)]
*  have gotten with Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  I think Matt Gaetz, who saw that it politically was becoming untenable, I think they both share [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=100.4s)]
*  the same values in this sense, is we must not ever weaponize the Department of Justice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  What they did to Donald Trump and people around him can never, ever happen again, ever. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=110.16s)]
*  And we've got to restore institutions like the FBI, the CIA, to their former greatness, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=114.72s)]
*  because they have been politicized, weaponized. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=121.44s)]
*  That has to end. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=123.6s)]
*  It can't be, they go after us when they're in power, we go after them when they're in power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=124.8s)]
*  No, this has to end altogether. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=128.4s)]
*  In other good news, Democrats sore loser Bob Casey, wow, amazing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=130.4s)]
*  He finally conceded weeks after Republican challenger Dave McCormick was declared the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=134.56s)]
*  winner. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=139.36s)]
*  Republicans now have a 53-seat majority in the U.S. Senate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Even though vote counting continues in California, the 2024 elections pretty much now in the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=144.24s)]
*  rearview mirror. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  And after a humiliating loss, Democrats, they kind of stop pretending. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=150.24s)]
*  The mask is coming off. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=155.44000000000003s)]
*  In other words, the big lie, you know, they're not pretending anymore. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  They're no longer the party of hardworking middle class men and women, all of you watching [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  this show, the people that make this country great. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  Get up, work hard, play by the rules, pay your taxes, obey the laws, take your kids [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  to church, study with them at night, cook them dinner. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=173.2s)]
*  You make the country great, because they literally don't care, they don't care about the people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=176.0s)]
*  that make America great. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=181.04s)]
*  They are, they are, you know, West Coast elitist and East Coast elitist. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=182.48s)]
*  Hollywood, San Francisco, New York, D.C., that's them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=187.44s)]
*  The DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, the FBI director, they won't even bother to show [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  up for their annual hearing on threats to our homeland. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  By the way, threats created by Harris and Biden and Mayorkas and their insane open borders, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=200.8s)]
*  crimes that should have been stopped by the FBI director, who had an opportunity to change [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=207.68s)]
*  course and reclaim the greatness of the finest law enforcement institution ever designed [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=213.6s)]
*  by man. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And the first time in 15 years America's top security officials will not tell you what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=220.96s)]
*  state of safety and security in our country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, they're accused of skipping out to avoid, quote, awkward questions about the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=230.8s)]
*  heinous murder of Lakin Reilly at the hands of an illegal immigrant just sentenced to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  life in prison, should have gotten the death penalty, in my view. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=240.16s)]
*  Sadly, Lakin is only one of a long list. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  We show you this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=246.16s)]
*  We showed you this throughout the whole campaign. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=247.28s)]
*  Americans murdered, raped, assaulted by unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=249.68s)]
*  who were welcomed into our country for now almost four straight years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=255.92s)]
*  But Alejandro Mayorkas and the FBI director Christopher Wray, they don't seem concerned [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=260.96s)]
*  to warn the American people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=266.4s)]
*  Christopher Wray has been saying the threat level has never been this bad. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=267.84s)]
*  Now that the election is over, say what? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=271.84s)]
*  They're no longer pretending to care. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the Biden administration, they just loosened illegal immigration restrictions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=276.48s)]
*  Yet again, Biden's DHS is now allowing all illegals who are abusing the asylum process, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=281.04s)]
*  aided and abetted by Harris and Biden, to skip their in-person check-ins at an ICE office [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=288.16s)]
*  and just use an app that's not working too well to check in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  According to FoxNews.com, quote, the app reportedly has severe glitching issues, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=297.36s)]
*  does not track a migrant's location if he or she is using an Android phone or a laptop, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=302.88s)]
*  and further, the app does not check illegal immigrants for past arrest, outstanding warrants. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=308.32s)]
*  Now, what does that mean? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=313.76s)]
*  That increases the odds dramatically that they will not be discovered ever again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=315.04s)]
*  That includes known terrorists in this country, murderers, rapists, gang members, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=321.36s)]
*  cartel members, other violent criminals. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=326.8s)]
*  In other words, Harris, Biden, Mayorkas, their legacy is one where they have literally put [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=328.88s)]
*  what they consider the rights, and there are no rights for illegal immigrants, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=335.2s)]
*  but the rights of the illegals in their mind over every single American safety and security, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=339.04s)]
*  and they put it over the rule of law and our constitution. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=345.76s)]
*  One New York City council member remarked, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=349.28s)]
*  this doesn't seem to be in the spirit of the peaceful transition that Biden promised. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=351.36s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=355.6s)]
*  I think that city council member is right, and the problems don't stop there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=356.8s)]
*  According to a report from the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=361.2s)]
*  criminals might actually be using Biden's lax parole program to traffic women, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=363.92s)]
*  young girls across the border, sex trafficking, prostitution. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=370.64s)]
*  The report also shows, quote, welfare recipients, people involved with criminal activity and even [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=375.84s)]
*  other illegal immigrants have been approved as sponsors for those paroled after crossing the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=381.76s)]
*  border illegally. Remember on the campaign trail when borders are, Kamala Harris claimed, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=388.56s)]
*  she tried so hard to secure the border, but Republicans, they got in the way. No, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=393.92s)]
*  her bill was an amnesty bill that would allow 2 million people in the country every year, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=398.32s)]
*  unvetted, of course, and it also gave them discretion not to enforce the law. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=403.12s)]
*  She was straight up lying, but now she's at it once again, totally unbothered by what has been. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=407.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris, still vice president, still border czar, on a lavish vacation in Hawaii, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=414.16s)]
*  not a care in the world. And as for your president, Joe Biden, he's still president. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=420.32s)]
*  The days are short, the naps are long, and the ability to do much of anything is waiting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=424.88s)]
*  before our very eyes. Take a look. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=429.44s)]
*  I didn't know any of these guys behind me, but they just showed up. I don't know where the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=432.88s)]
*  hell they came from. 2024 NBA champions, the balls. You're celdics, right? The Boston celdics. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=436.48s)]
*  Why is that not funny? A sad, tragic end to a terrible presidency. And while Democrats, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=451.68s)]
*  while they struggled to pick up the pieces, maybe they could take some notes from Donald Trump. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  Voters love the president's authenticity. They love that the president-elect says what he [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=463.84s)]
*  believes. And with Democrats during an election, it's all smoke and it's all mirrors and it's all [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  lies and it's all name calling. It's all demagoguery. I mean, it's all disgusting and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=474.0s)]
*  repulsive, to be honest. And frankly, it's exhausting. Even disgraced former NBC news [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  anchor Brian Williams, who himself, to be honest, knows a thing or two about smoke and mirrors, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK7zoZW9E4A&t=483.91999999999996s)]
