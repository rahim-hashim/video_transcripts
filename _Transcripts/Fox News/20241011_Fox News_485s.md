# Kamala Harris ‘hid’ from Americans this week: Karoline Leavitt
**Fox News:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas)
*  National Press Secretary Caroline Levitt, we will get back to the rally in just a minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to get some initial reaction. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=5.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor, he's got his hat on, he's made millions from his hat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Leo 2.0. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=11.36s)]
*  Terrell. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=12.36s)]
*  That's true, that's true. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=13.36s)]
*  Welcome all of you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=15.36s)]
*  Caroline, let's get your reaction to this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=16.84s)]
*  The—Univision denies the story, by the way, about the teleprompter, just for the record. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=19.84s)]
*  On the issue of immigration, I thought that video that President Trump played was really [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=25.48s)]
*  powerful. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=31.68s)]
*  And, you know, we do have gang members here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=32.68s)]
*  We've had dozens of Americans murdered. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=35.92s)]
*  We've had dozens raped. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=38.28s)]
*  We know the fentanyl crisis. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=40.68s)]
*  We know the opioid crisis. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=42.74s)]
*  We also know a lot of other things that have happened in this country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=45.6s)]
*  We have gang members in this country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=49.84s)]
*  We have people from 180 countries, including Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=52.42s)]
*  Venezuela, as the president pointed out, and tens of thousands from China and Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=58.38s)]
*  And I doubt they're all coming here because they want a better life for themselves and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  their family. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=66.5s)]
*  Between the economy, which the president also discussed, and immigration and law and order, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=67.9s)]
*  you're talking about three of the biggest issues that I think will impact this country [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=73.54s)]
*  come Election Day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=76.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Sean. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=78.5s)]
*  You just heard President Trump in Nevada capping off a week that he won. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=81.02s)]
*  He won the week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=85.86s)]
*  He traveled from Nevada, where he is tonight, to Aurora, Colorado today to highlight the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=86.86s)]
*  impact and the consequences of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's wide-open border invasion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=91.94s)]
*  He was in Pennsylvania earlier in the week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  He was in Detroit, Michigan yesterday announcing his plan to revitalize the American auto industry, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=98.82s)]
*  his Build It in America plan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=104.3s)]
*  He barnstormed the country, offering real solutions to the problems that Kamala Harris's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=106.86s)]
*  terrible policies and incompetence have created. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=112.26s)]
*  And what did Kamala Harris do this week? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=115.18s)]
*  Well, she hid from the American people who are suffering in the wake of Hurricane Milton [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=117.02s)]
*  and Hurricane Helene. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=121.14s)]
*  She botched her 60 Minutes interview. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=122.98s)]
*  It was a complete train wreck. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=125.06s)]
*  And she said the quiet part out loud on The View of All Places with the very liberal ladies [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=127.1s)]
*  there who were astonished by her answer when they asked, what would you do differently [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=131.88s)]
*  over the past four years? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=136.38000000000002s)]
*  And Kamala Harris answered saying, not a thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=138.02s)]
*  There is not a thing she would change from the past four years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=142.06s)]
*  Not the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that left 13 service members dead. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  Not the inflation crisis that's robbing American families of their paycheck every single week. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=150.0s)]
*  Not the border crisis that has left innocent American women raped and left for dead by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=154.3s)]
*  heinous monsters who shouldn't be in this country in the first place. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=159.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris wouldn't change a thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=162.22000000000003s)]
*  So the American people found out the truth this week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=164.06s)]
*  If you want more crime, chaos and inflation, vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=166.62s)]
*  But if you want safety and law and order and real affordability in this country, again, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=170.02s)]
*  there's only one man on the ballot. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=175.02s)]
*  He's speaking in Nevada tonight to a fired up crowd, and it's Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=176.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to get back to it in a second. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=179.86s)]
*  I just want to get some commentary. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=182.34s)]
*  Joe Concha, one thing that has frustrated me, and you analyze the media better than [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=183.82s)]
*  anybody, is the fact that they don't vet her. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't talk about the murder, the rape, the violent crime, the cost, the total number, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=193.14s)]
*  12-plus million under her watch, as borders are, illegal immigrants, the free housing, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=199.98s)]
*  healthcare, food, education, sex change surgery, path to citizenship, legal driver's licenses, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=205.77999999999997s)]
*  college education from Tim Walz if you go to Minnesota. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  They don't talk about any of that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=216.1s)]
*  And you know, it's such a disservice to the American people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=218.42s)]
*  They're not going to describe the Green New Deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=221.14s)]
*  They're not going to describe, you know, why she co-sponsored it or eliminating the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=222.86s)]
*  filibuster or, you know, government healthcare for all, no private health insurance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=226.58s)]
*  There's so much on the table that doesn't come out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=231.22000000000003s)]
*  Thirty-one flavors of flip flops, Sean, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  That's what we have here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=239.3s)]
*  So many things to analyze, so many things to ask her about in terms of this was your [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=240.3s)]
*  position then when you ran for president in 2019, when you couldn't even get to the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=244.62s)]
*  California primary because Democratic voters rejected you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  Now, why did you change all these positions and all the things you just said, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=252.38s)]
*  So let's go through the Kamala Harris 2024 timeline, Sean. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=256.98s)]
*  Kamala Harris didn't earn one single vote when she ran in 2020, which was really 2019. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=260.42s)]
*  Again, she didn't get to 2020. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=265.54s)]
*  And when she was gift wrapped the 2024 nomination, again, not one vote. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=267.56s)]
*  And then from there, she didn't need to say a thing outside of a teleprompter for two [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=271.8s)]
*  months. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=276.3s)]
*  It was Brat Summer. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=277.3s)]
*  It was the August of Joy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=278.3s)]
*  She then was handed a rigged debate on ABC. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=279.8s)]
*  Eleven fact checks and follow-ups for Donald Trump, zero fact checks and follow-ups for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=282.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=287.22s)]
*  But then not long after, it's DEF CON 1 in the Democratic Party. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Suddenly, wow, she's not getting in the polls. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=292.68s)]
*  How could that be possible? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=295.44s)]
*  Well, it's possible because she has an authenticity problem. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=296.56s)]
*  She simply is not likable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=300.2s)]
*  She's not good at this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=301.6s)]
*  And to your monologue earlier, Sean, she is losing at an alarming rate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=304.0s)]
*  Black voters, Hispanic voters, Jewish voters, Catholic voters, but most importantly, union [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=308.2s)]
*  voters, teamsters, steelworkers, autoworkers, restaurants, service workers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=313.44s)]
*  That's a big deal in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=317.96s)]
*  If the election were held today, Donald Trump wins in an electoral landslide because Kamala [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=321.5s)]
*  Harris is arguably the worst candidate in presidential election history. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=326.98s)]
*  Fake, phony, no authenticity, all icing, no cake when it comes to actual substance. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  And it must be hard to be brilliant when there's no way to prove it, Sean, but think of it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=337.74s)]
*  this way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  In the real clear politics average right now, Trump is leading in six of seven swing states. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  That's the average. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=348.12s)]
*  Not one poll, the average of all polls. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=349.12s)]
*  He'll likely make it seven of seven when he overtakes Wisconsin very soon. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  So here's how this election is going to work. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  If Kamala Harris has a focus, like she has been during this media blitz during this week, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  when she's oftentimes a human Chernobyl, she loses. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=361.72s)]
*  The polling goes south because she is not authentic and her answers are substance free. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=364.92s)]
*  It's all frosting and no cake. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  So the Trump campaign knows this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  They should show some discipline, let Kamala be the focus, sink herself simply by speaking [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=373.72s)]
*  and let Donald Trump do his rallies, do a town hall on Fox News like he's going to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=379.68s)]
*  do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=383.68s)]
*  No more debates. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=384.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=385.68s)]
*  That's the way this election is going to be decided. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=386.68s)]
*  Let Kamala Harris be the referendum. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  All right, Leo, we're going to go back to President Trump, but first I want to get your [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=389.8s)]
*  comments, your observations about this and about the state of the campaign with 25 days [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=394.44s)]
*  to go. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, the state of the campaign is basically it's Trump momentum. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  And I agree with what my two colleagues have said. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=403.6s)]
*  It's going to be a Trump victory. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=406.32000000000005s)]
*  But here's the point. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=407.88s)]
*  They threw out their best weapon. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g_cvER8aas&t=408.96000000000004s)]
