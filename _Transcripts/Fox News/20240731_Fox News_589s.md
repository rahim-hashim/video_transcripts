# Hannity: The world is on edge tonight
**Fox News:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, the world is on edge. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=1.48s)]
*  In the span of 48 hours, two top terrorists were eliminated, including the leader of Hamas [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=3.36s)]
*  inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=8.3s)]
*  At this hour, we are monitoring the situation abroad, where Iran's supreme leader has now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=11.32s)]
*  vowed to retaliate against Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=16.0s)]
*  So now Israel, they are battling Hamas in the south, out of Gaza, Hezbollah in the north, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=18.48s)]
*  out of Lebanon, and likely facing more missile attacks from Iran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=24.0s)]
*  And the Democrats, they are now running a presidential candidate that thinks Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=28.8s)]
*  should not defend itself, should constantlyâ€”are constantly lecturing them to show restraint, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=32.6s)]
*  and we should have the courage to never again use the term radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=38.68s)]
*  Things have gotten extraordinarily dangerous around the globe, and they might get worse. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=44.6s)]
*  Back at home, Democrats, the state-run media mob, they are prioritizing identity politics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=49.68s)]
*  Today, former President Trump participated in a panel at the National Association of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=55.04s)]
*  Black Journalists, and that was a conference in Chicago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=60.12s)]
*  And apparently, ABC reporter Rachel Scott was not happy about it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=63.48s)]
*  In fact, she didn't open with Mr. President. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=67.48s)]
*  I hope you're feeling better after your assassination attempt. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  No, she opened the question-and-answer session with several hostile allegations. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=72.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=77.92s)]
*  I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room, sir. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=78.92s)]
*  A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=82.92s)]
*  You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=87.64s)]
*  Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=92.6s)]
*  You have told four congresswomen of color who were American citizens to go back to where [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=97.44s)]
*  they came from. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=101.56s)]
*  You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  You've attacked black journalists, calling them a loser, saying the questions that they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=108.32s)]
*  ask are, quote, stupid and racist. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=111.96s)]
*  You've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=114.88s)]
*  So my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, why should [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=118.44s)]
*  black voters trust you after you have used language like that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=124.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=128.56s)]
*  the first question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=135.84s)]
*  You don't even say, hello, how are you? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=136.84s)]
*  Are you with ABC? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=140.76s)]
*  Because I think they're a fake news network, a terrible network. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=142.04s)]
*  And I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=146.48s)]
*  I love the black population of this country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=153.28s)]
*  I've done so much for the black population of this country, including employment, including [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=155.64s)]
*  Opportunity Zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=163.44s)]
*  programs ever for black workers and black entrepreneurs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=168.76s)]
*  Maybe if ABC was an honest network and they had fair journalists, maybe President Trump's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=175.44s)]
*  real record with African Americans would be front and center because he has a strong record. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Also, maybe it's time for Donald Trump to reject any appearance at ABC. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  For example, why would he show up at their debate if the, quote, journalists clearly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=190.16s)]
*  have opinion and want to debate Donald Trump themselves? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=195.56s)]
*  And maybe he should just accept the Fox News channels offered a debate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=199.16s)]
*  The first debate was on CNN. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  Why not have the second one on Fox News? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=203.52s)]
*  But back to my point. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=205.8s)]
*  Under President Trump's administration, well, black unemployment in America hit a record [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=207.44s)]
*  low. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=212.12s)]
*  The wealth gap was closing and income was rising. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=213.12s)]
*  He said record high after record high unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Asian Americans, women in the workplace and African American youth unemployment. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=221.28s)]
*  New Special Economic Opportunity Zones spurred development in predominantly African American [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=225.84s)]
*  neighborhoods that Democrats had long given up on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=230.88s)]
*  Under President Trump, federal funding for historically black colleges and universities, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=234.52s)]
*  that hit an all time record high. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=238.96s)]
*  And criminal justice reform, spearheaded by Donald Trump, it freed countless of African [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=240.84s)]
*  Americans who were serving lengthy prison sentences for nonviolent crimes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=246.08s)]
*  We called it disparate, disparate sentencing that they were experiencing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=250.64s)]
*  President Trump also granted clemency and pardons to many African Americans, including [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  prominent African Americans, also including, remember, the great grandmother, Alice Marie [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=260.44s)]
*  Johnson, who could forget that moment, who was sentenced to life in prison for one drug [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=266.64s)]
*  related charge. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  But ABC's Rachel Scott wasn't interested in any of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  And apparently neither was the reporter from Semaphore. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=276.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=279.8s)]
*  I'm going to get my J.D. Vance question in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=280.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  To your point and to Rachel's point, he, you know, has a lot of opinions about childless [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  women like myself or divorced people like yourself. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=289.88s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=294.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, my point is here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=295.0s)]
*  But at least it was said in a friendly manner. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=298.0s)]
*  My point is... [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=299.72s)]
*  He does have a sense of humor. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=300.72s)]
*  You got to give it to him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=304.72s)]
*  Before the noise, this election does need to be about the issues and beliefs and performance [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=306.68s)]
*  of both candidates. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=310.84s)]
*  Now, but what the state-run media mob will never focus on is Kamala Harris, her track [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=312.12s)]
*  record, her in her own words and her extreme beliefs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  The media refuses to vet her political positions, which now seem to change with regularity, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=322.0s)]
*  which is somewhat laughable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=327.0s)]
*  She wanted to ban private health insurance and, of course, Medicare for all. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=328.68s)]
*  And now she doesn't. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=334.12s)]
*  She sponsored the bill in the Senate with Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=335.48s)]
*  She wanted to abolish ICE, even comparing them to the KKK. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=338.56s)]
*  Now she wants to give them more funding. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=342.12s)]
*  She wanted to reimagine public safety and the police and take police off the street, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=344.0s)]
*  praised L.A. for defunding the police. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=349.16s)]
*  And now she no longer supports that, she says. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=351.52s)]
*  And strongly she advocated for mandatory federal gun confiscation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=354.6s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, no longer supports it, out of nowhere. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=359.08s)]
*  And she frequently called for a ban on fracking, but is apparently now pro-fracking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, remember the mandatory gun buyback program? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=367.5s)]
*  Yeah, that was a program that would be like confiscation, except they give you a few bucks [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  for it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=376.06s)]
*  Anyway, sounds like the quintessential ambitious politician in the swamp that will say and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=377.06s)]
*  do anything to get into power and stay in power. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=381.94s)]
*  It's almost like a caricature of a bad politician. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=385.18s)]
*  But no one really truly knows what she believes, because that's now changing daily. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=388.38s)]
*  Again, state-run media mob that won't bother to even ask. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  Kamala has given few interviews during her time as vice president, zero interviews on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=397.5s)]
*  Fox News, and since announcing her bid for president, she has conducted zero press conferences, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=402.54s)]
*  given her track record as border czar and a senator. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  I think it's a safe bet that Kamala is extremely far left, more radical than any major party [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=412.06s)]
*  presidential candidate, frankly, in American history. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  I can think of nobody more left. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  On the other hand, Donald Trump says what he believes, like it or not. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  He will tell you what he plans to do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=425.62s)]
*  And as four years as president, he followed through on his promises. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=427.58s)]
*  You want border security? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=431.26s)]
*  Did it before? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=432.7s)]
*  He'll do it again. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=433.7s)]
*  You want peace through strength? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=434.7s)]
*  You think the world will be safer and more secure with Donald Trump? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=435.7s)]
*  Did it before? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=439.06s)]
*  I would imagine he would do it again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=440.06s)]
*  You want lower inflation, lower gas prices? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=441.7s)]
*  You want a stronger economy? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=444.14s)]
*  He did it before, and he will do it again. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akUfeRp4G4A&t=445.82s)]
