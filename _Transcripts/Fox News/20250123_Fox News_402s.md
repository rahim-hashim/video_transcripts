# Hannity: Trump is executing his agenda at a ‘lighting pace’
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight part two of my Oval Office interview with the President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  That's only moments away. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=7.24s)]
*  We talk about tax cuts, Putin, Ukraine, China, President Xi, North Korea, Iran, so much more. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=8.64s)]
*  Also breaking tonight, Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth has officially cleared his procedural [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  vote in the Senate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  We'll now advance to a confirmation vote, likely around this time tomorrow night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  If you are counting, it is only day four of the new Trump administration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=28.52s)]
*  The activity level is off the charts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=33.08s)]
*  The president dialed in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=35.86s)]
*  He is executing his agenda at a lightning-fast pace. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=37.32s)]
*  Now, here's something we rarely see in American politics. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  President Trump is actually keeping his campaign promises, and he's doing them as quickly as possible. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=45.64s)]
*  Breaking tonight, the president signed a new order to declassify the JFK, RFK, MLK assassination [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=52.64s)]
*  files without delay. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=59.88s)]
*  As promised, the president is committed to government transparency. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=61.72s)]
*  He's also committed to securing our borders. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=65.8s)]
*  Look at this headline, quote, border encounters drop sharply as Trump launches crackdown on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=69.12s)]
*  illegal immigration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=75.6s)]
*  I think he said he was going to do that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=76.6s)]
*  Now, of course, that crackdown does include deportations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=78.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going back to Haiti. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  One of those threats is this illegal alien from Haiti. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=84.72s)]
*  ICE says he's a gang member with 17 criminal convictions in recent years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  You feel me? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=93.0s)]
*  Yo, Biden forever, bro. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=94.72s)]
*  Thank Obama for everything that he said for me, bro. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=96.68s)]
*  I think he's going back to Haiti. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=99.48s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump has empowered immigration and customs enforcement to do their job in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  all 50 states. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=105.68s)]
*  Yep, even sanctuary states and cities. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=107.0s)]
*  He also declared a national emergency at the border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=109.76s)]
*  He's deployed U.S. Marines to the region. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=113.28s)]
*  He has now reinstituted the stay of Mexico policy for so-called asylum seekers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=115.8s)]
*  And Donald Trump also pressuring Mexico to secure their own southern border and, by the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=121.52s)]
*  way, close the newly renamed Gulf of America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=127.52s)]
*  The president also making good on his promise to demolish globalism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=130.76s)]
*  He has already removed the U.S. from the destructive Paris climate accords. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=135.6s)]
*  Those accords say China and India are developing nations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=140.96s)]
*  He also withdrew our country from the horrendous global minimum tax, the WHO. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=144.52s)]
*  He's again moving at lightning speed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=151.2s)]
*  Today, during his speech in front of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=153.32s)]
*  president vowed to always put America first. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=158.4s)]
*  And he delivered a powerful blow to the censorship-loving elites. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=162.36s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=167.0s)]
*  Now, the president, he also used that speech to call out someone sitting in the very room [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=192.36s)]
*  in Davos, Bank of America's CEO. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=204.24s)]
*  According to a 15-state coalition, the Bank of America has discriminated against Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=208.08s)]
*  for political and religious reasons. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=214.56s)]
*  The attorney general of Virginia also accused the bank of, quote, voluntarily cooperating [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=217.36s)]
*  with the FBI, the U.S. Treasury under Biden to profile conservative and religious Americans [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=221.76s)]
*  as potential domestic terrorists. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=227.88s)]
*  And here is what President Trump had to say to the bank's CEO. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=230.64s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  By the way, speaking of you, and you've done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=240.56s)]
*  to do business within the bank. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=245.84s)]
*  And that included a place called Bank of America. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=247.6s)]
*  They don't take conservative business. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=251.28s)]
*  And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=253.72s)]
*  Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=258.52s)]
*  what you're doing is wrong. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=262.12s)]
*  Now, Bank of America's CEO did not respond at the event, but the bank later issued a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=263.52s)]
*  statement denying that they have a political litmus test despite multiple serious allegations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=268.0s)]
*  Now, the president is not going to play nice after years of political rot. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=274.2s)]
*  He's going to stand up to anyone. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=279.24s)]
*  He will hold them accountable in front of the entire world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=280.8s)]
*  And that includes America's deep state spy apparatus. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=283.92s)]
*  Now after meddling in the 2020 election with that deceptive letter suggesting that the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=287.76s)]
*  very real and true Hunter Biden laptop story was likely Russian disinformation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=293.2s)]
*  Remember, 51 former intel officials. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=298.72s)]
*  Well, they have now been stripped of their security clearance. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=301.24s)]
*  And that includes a notorious liar, former Marxist John Brennan, who is still lying. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=305.32s)]
*  And by the way, very sad, he will no longer be able to abuse that special access. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=310.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=316.2s)]
*  As you point out, he misrepresented the facts in that executive order because it said that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=317.2s)]
*  we had suggested that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=320.76s)]
*  No, we said it was for the hallmarks of Russian information operations, including the dumping [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  of accurate information, which is what we said in that letter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=330.76s)]
*  And that's right where he belongs over there at the conspiracy peddling MSDNC. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=335.04s)]
*  Frankly, he's just lying. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=339.68s)]
*  Look at this old headline from The Guardian, quote, John Brennan lied to you and to the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=341.48s)]
*  Senate fire him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=346.2s)]
*  As you can see, Brennan has long been accused of leaking classified information, lying to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=347.84s)]
*  Congress, spreading baseless smears on MSDNC. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=353.28s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=358.04s)]
*  President Trump is actually draining the swamp as promised. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=359.44s)]
*  He's firing political hacks. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=362.44s)]
*  He is forcing bureaucrats back to the office five days a week. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=364.24s)]
*  He is pausing all federal regulation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=368.32s)]
*  He is getting rid of all the DEI programs and employees. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=370.96s)]
*  Our country is now positioned to make the greatest comeback ever seen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=374.84s)]
*  Trump is calling it a new golden age in America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=379.8s)]
*  We talked about this and so much more yesterday in the Oval Office. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=382.88s)]
*  Here is part two of my interview with the president. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=394.2s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdSvzEPYEk&t=398.12s)]
