# The winds in LA were ‘historic’: Harold Ford, Jr.
**Fox News:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA)
*  Here with reaction co-host of the hit show the five also a friend of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=0.0s)]
*  program our friend Harold Ford jr. Good to see you happy new year sir. Same to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=4.32s)]
*  you happy new year congratulations on the great personal announcement. Oh I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=8.72s)]
*  really appreciate it means the world thank you and everyone's been really [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=12.88s)]
*  really kind and supportive. Alright so you're you're from Tennessee you're a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=15.6s)]
*  congressman from Tennessee. I always knew you and you would always come on the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=21.56s)]
*  show and you'd always be reasonable. Look at California is there anything about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=26.56s)]
*  what is happening out there be it with the fire high level of taxation burdensome [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=32.12s)]
*  regulation that you that you think is smart. Well a lot of people Sean live [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=38.12s)]
*  there and a lot of people that I have a lot of friends and family some have been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=43.84s)]
*  affected adversely by the by the fires in the last several days and my prayers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=48.32s)]
*  continue to go out to families who've lost loved ones and obviously people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=52.72s)]
*  trying to recover and rebuild but people make a decision to live there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=56.16s)]
*  and there's a lot of beauty and there's a lot of majesty about living in a lot [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  of prestige about living out there. I think as we sit here at this moment and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=63.72s)]
*  I listen to some of the criticism which I think is warranted for some of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=67.32s)]
*  leadership out there the only advice that that I would have for both sides [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=70.96s)]
*  those who have been critical and the leadership is I think the timing of some [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=75.0s)]
*  of our criticism of them probably could wait a bit because I think there's a lot [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  of accountability and blame the go-around. I think for the elected [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=83.24s)]
*  officials the frustration that I have living in New York and I hear from those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=86.08s)]
*  in California is that the political leadership doesn't seem to be able to do [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=89.44s)]
*  the two or three things that people want to know most. First what are you doing to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=92.96s)]
*  contain the fires and give us very honest in real time and current updates [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=96.52s)]
*  a forthright updates on what's happening we see some of that on our own network [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=100.28s)]
*  we'll see in the bottom right hand corner how fires are being contained. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=104.08s)]
*  Tell us what security measures are being instituted in communities and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=107.28s)]
*  neighborhoods to ensure that looters aren't able to run free. And then [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=110.48s)]
*  finally I think some of the political markets there's no question will hold [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=114.92s)]
*  the mayor and the governor and others who need to be held accountable for what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=118.04s)]
*  they did do what they didn't do with the tax dollars. I think what you put up [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  early right before I came on Sean those are compelling numbers and you think [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=124.56s)]
*  about the tax numbers you think about the people leaving the state those are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=128.56s)]
*  questions that voters will eventually ask of these elected officials and as you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=131.8s)]
*  and I both know when elected officials are unable to answer questions like [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=135.52s)]
*  that about quality of life issues during times of crisis that you'll get re-elected. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=139.56s)]
*  What do you say now these Santa Ana winds are predictable wildfires they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=143.56s)]
*  happen regularly they have hydrants that don't have water the governor says well [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  that's up to the local people they have a reservoir in Pacific Palisades that's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=154.96s)]
*  empty they don't practice the science of forestry they're not clearing the brush [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  they're not doing controlled burns they're cutting the budget to the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  firefighters they have the highest taxes in the entire country and then [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=167.72s)]
*  they're going to spend 650 million dollars making the port of LA green and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=172.32s)]
*  they're going to spend billions of dollars on wind turbines. Now that to me [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=176.48s)]
*  seems like they're misprioritizing pretty much everything out there and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=181.36s)]
*  they're misappropriating taxpayer dollars and people are leaving with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=184.92s)]
*  their feet they're leaving in droves. So Sean all of those numbers are are [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=188.84s)]
*  daunting and I think as voters out there and residents out there these are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=193.28s)]
*  decisions they'll have to make and will make I believe in the coming the coming [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=197.04s)]
*  months and coming years as they think about leadership retaining leadership or [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  even electing new leadership but listening to those numbers one can't but [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=203.84s)]
*  help ask the question. Now I do I do give them a break here I think these 60 to 90 [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=207.48s)]
*  mile-per-hour winds were unusual were historic and I hope that whatever one of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=212.56s)]
*  the things I hope they draw from this and learn from this is how they can [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=217.56s)]
*  better address this issue you can note no politician for that matter Democrat or [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=220.44s)]
*  Republican can control wind speed nor we asking them to but I think we have to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=225.88s)]
*  be better prepared they can be better prepared going forward and I pray that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=230.0s)]
*  they're able to get through this enormity of a problem and if they are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=235.32s)]
*  able to prepare and be better prepared I should say for the challenges going forward. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=238.56s)]
*  Last thing's a question in the state of Tennessee where you once were a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=244.6s)]
*  congressman they have zero income tax in the state of New York you I don't know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=249.24s)]
*  if you're living in New York City you are you're paying you're paying 13 and a half percent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=253.56s)]
*  Where would you rather live financially? Well Sean you live in a state that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=257.24s)]
*  has some of that that that as well and I enjoyed that but I love I love New York [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=263.16s)]
*  and I know and I have and I'm with my kids my kids love it it's all yours 11 [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  and 9 but I think but but that's the point everyone is able to make that make [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=273.48s)]
*  those decisions but I don't want it all minimize what you put up that the fact [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=276.92s)]
*  if you live in California and you're faced with the kind of challenge the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=280.68s)]
*  unfortunate the tragic challenge that faced with right now you want more from [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  government officials and I hope that they get more. You're probably the best [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=287.64s)]
*  spokesperson for the Democratic Party than anybody else out there they really [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=292.44s)]
*  should hire you because you you can talk reasonably to people and I think this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=298.2s)]
*  is one of the major reasons why they lost this election. Harold Ford jr. we [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=304.44s)]
*  appreciate you as always thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PD-TK1DqA&t=308.56s)]
