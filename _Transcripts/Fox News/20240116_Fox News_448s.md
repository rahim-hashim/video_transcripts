# Ted Cruz endorses Trump for president: 'Time to unite'
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc)
*  As Biden's poll numbers continue to slump, well, buckle up for what will be, as I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=0.0s)]
*  just saying, one of the most negative campaigns in American history without anything positive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=5.08s)]
*  for Joe Biden to run on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=10.26s)]
*  If you can name something, please text us, email us at The Hannity Show. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=12.26s)]
*  We'd love to hear from you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=16.3s)]
*  The Biden campaign, as I said, democracy in peril. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=17.64s)]
*  Well, by the way, that's simultaneously trying to kick Republicans off ballots. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=20.78s)]
*  A little ironic, isn't it? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=25.26s)]
*  They'll obsess about Donald Trump, Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=27.18s)]
*  They'll never want to talk about Joe's records. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Everything about January 6, except the facts, you know, like the police chief, Capitol [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=32.68s)]
*  Police Chief's son, the remarks, peacefully, patriotically, march to the Capitol so your [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=39.12s)]
*  voices will be heard. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=45.96s)]
*  Those facts, that narrative, anything that doesn't fit their narrative, they, in fact, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  won't tell you about. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=52.04s)]
*  They will demagogue abortion and, as I said, employ the left-wing classic identity politics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=53.3s)]
*  That playbook like never before, right on cue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=59.16s)]
*  Anti-Trump, Fulton County DA Fannie Willis now blaming the serious misconduct allegations [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=62.48s)]
*  against her on racism. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=68.0s)]
*  Anyway, here to respond to all of this, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, by the way, another person [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=70.2s)]
*  that actually, you beat Donald Trump in 2016 in Iowa, at the Iowa caucuses, and you ran [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=74.84s)]
*  a very tough campaign against him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts about last night? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=85.8s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's great to be with you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=87.84s)]
*  Listen, last night was decisive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=89.64s)]
*  It was, it was a dominating victory for Donald Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=91.64s)]
*  I got to say, there's no place like the Iowa caucuses. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  I know it intimately. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=98.72s)]
*  The men and women of Iowa, they take their responsibility incredibly seriously. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=100.04s)]
*  They scrutinize the candidates. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=104.16s)]
*  It's an amazing process. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=106.14s)]
*  And I'm a big believer in letting democracy play out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, last night it played out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=110.16s)]
*  And I got to say, Trump's victory was across the board. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  He won 51% of the vote. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=115.4s)]
*  He won 98% of the counties. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=117.44s)]
*  Congratulations to President Trump on that dominating victory. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=119.2s)]
*  And at this point, I believe this race is over. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=123.8s)]
*  So I am proud to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=126.88s)]
*  I look forward to supporting him enthusiastically, because I think it's time for the Republican [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=131.04s)]
*  Party to unite, for us to come together. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=136.32s)]
*  We've got to beat Joe Biden. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=138.88s)]
*  We've got to beat this disastrous cultural Marxist agenda in the White House. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=140.76s)]
*  We've got to retake the United States Senate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=145.32s)]
*  We've got to hold the House. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=147.56s)]
*  We got to come together and win. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=148.84s)]
*  And with the results last night, the people have spoken. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=150.68s)]
*  It's time to move onward to victory in November. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=153.76s)]
*  So you basically think when you look at the map, it's going to be New Hampshire, Nevada, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=157.24s)]
*  South Carolina, Super Tuesday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=161.48s)]
*  You know the map as well as anybody. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=163.32s)]
*  When you look at that map, what do you see? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=165.3s)]
*  Look, I don't see any path to victory for anyone other than Donald Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=168.4s)]
*  New Hampshire may be closely contested. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=175.88s)]
*  I think after New Hampshire, it will go to South Carolina. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=176.88s)]
*  I believe in South Carolina, you're going to see Trump win a dominating victory in South [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=179.76s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=183.92s)]
*  And after that, you've got Super Tuesday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't see a path for any candidate after that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=187.44s)]
*  And I'm a big believer we need to let the process play out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  It did. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=193.76s)]
*  And the results last night, 51 percent, 98 counties, that's compelling. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=194.76s)]
*  And at this point, I think the contrast needs to be on substance and policy and records. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=200.8s)]
*  You mentioned a minute ago, the classic test of any presidential race. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Are you better off today than you were four years ago? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  And I got to say for just about every person in America, the answer is hell no. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=213.34s)]
*  Unless you happen to be a big tech billionaire or a Mexican drug lord, those guys, they ought [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=217.8s)]
*  to vote for Joe Biden because they have done fantastic over the last four years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=225.44s)]
*  But Senator, I've got to take issue with you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=230.86s)]
*  You're obviously not listening to the media mob and you're not listening to Joe and the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=233.34s)]
*  vice president and Harris and you're not listening to circleback Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=238.46s)]
*  and Alejandro Mayorkas because they have been telling us the border's closed and the border's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=243.74s)]
*  secure. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=249.38s)]
*  Those 10 million people that we know now have entered this country illegally, many from [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=250.38s)]
*  countries that don't like us, our top geopolitical foes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=255.22s)]
*  Many with deep ties to terrorists are showing up at that border. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=258.66s)]
*  But you know, obviously it's closed and it's secure because that's what they keep saying. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=263.26s)]
*  Are they lying to us? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=267.9s)]
*  They are absolutely lying. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=270.3s)]
*  And I got to say, I really enjoyed that montage you started your show with of Jake Tapper [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=271.68s)]
*  and Rachel Maddow and all these leftists crying. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=276.04s)]
*  It reminded me of, I will confess anytime I'm a little bit, little bit down, I like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=279.26s)]
*  to play Rachel Maddow on election day in 2016 and the absolute shock and pain and agony. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=283.62s)]
*  Schadenfreude is not a pretty instinct, but, but they are, look, they hated Trump in 2016. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=289.54s)]
*  They hate him even more now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=296.42s)]
*  They are broken. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  They are liars. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  There's a reason. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  I agree with what Mike Huckabee said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a reason they cut off Trump's speech because if they actually believed it was as [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=302.82000000000005s)]
*  horrible as they said, they would want to play it, but they don't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  Jake Tapper just wants to say anti-immigrant. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=309.94s)]
*  Listen, I'm the son of an immigrant from Cuba, but there's a right way to come that is legally. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=312.54s)]
*  And I'll tell you, my home state of Texas, there is no state in the country that is bearing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=316.7s)]
*  the brunt of this invasion more than the state of Texas. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=320.58s)]
*  And Joe Biden and the Democrats, they don't give a damn. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=325.22s)]
*  They don't care about the dead bodies that are piling up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=328.0s)]
*  They don't care about the children who are brutalized, the women who are sexually assaulted, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=330.54s)]
*  the more than 100,000 people have died of drug overdoses. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think the American people are fed up with this chaos of the border, and they recognize [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=338.54s)]
*  that much of the corporate media is just lying to them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=342.9s)]
*  Senator, let me ask this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=346.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=347.02s)]
*  Well said. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=348.02s)]
*  I noticed Chuck Schumer has targeted you, number one. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=349.02s)]
*  You will likely be facing, at the time, Beto Bozo, as I called him, a Rourke, was considered [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=352.68s)]
*  a real candidate and got a ton of money, over $100 million, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=358.68s)]
*  I don't know why, but every time you run for reelection, you are maybe the second most [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=363.38s)]
*  hated man behind Donald Trump in politics. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=368.3s)]
*  They really, they're gunning for you big time, politically speaking. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=370.94s)]
*  Well, listen, I wear that as a badge of honor, but you're right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=374.7s)]
*  If you are a left-wing Democrat, after Donald Trump, there's nobody in the country you want [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=378.38s)]
*  to beat more than me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=383.3s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer's made clear I am his number one target in the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=384.86s)]
*  The Democrats are going to spend $100 million this year trying to beat me and trying to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=388.98s)]
*  flip Texas blue. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=393.82s)]
*  Now that ain't going to happen. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=395.5s)]
*  I got to say, last time I went on your show, the incredible viewers of Hannity, I encourage [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=396.7s)]
*  folks, go to TedCruz.org, TedCruz.org, TedCruz.org. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=401.14s)]
*  Thousands of people went to TedCruz.org. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVGeh08zFc&t=406.26s)]
