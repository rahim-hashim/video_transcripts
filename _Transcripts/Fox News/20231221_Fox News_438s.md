# Biden, Harris 'solely responsible' for lives lost from border chaos: Stephen Miller
**Fox News:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8)
*  The Biden administration has no answers, literally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=0.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=3.64s)]
*  Some illegal border crossers are being given court dates in 2031. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=4.64s)]
*  What are they supposed to do here for seven years? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=10.24s)]
*  Again, that's a better question put to the DHS. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=12.4s)]
*  I'm not in a position to talk about specific cases like that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The president believes that we've got to do better at immigration, and he's willing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=18.88s)]
*  to talk and negotiate with members of Congress about immigration policy, just as well as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  he is about border security. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=26.48s)]
*  Biden and Harris can't get to the border, but Sarah Carter is on location in Eagle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=29.84s)]
*  Pass, Texas, the site of some of the worst illegal immigration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  She joins us now, along with former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=38.02s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=42.92s)]
*  Sarah, you heard the report from Bill Mollusian. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=46.72s)]
*  You heard the report from Bill Mollusian. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=47.72s)]
*  Walk us through what you're seeing in Eagle Pass and why is it one of the worst places [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=49.92s)]
*  right now for illegal immigration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=53.06s)]
*  Well, it's certainly an area, Kelly, right behind me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=56.88s)]
*  I have probably around 1,500 people that are still being processed through. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  So you ask the question, why is this area so imperative? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=66.04s)]
*  Well, it's because it's an area controlled by trafficking organizations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=69.72s)]
*  The drug cartels own this part of the border. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=74.64s)]
*  They move people in with impunity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=78.62s)]
*  They are running on the opposite side from Piedras Negras all the way up to Mata Moros [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=81.08s)]
*  and straight down the line to Lukeville where we have Bill Mollusian. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  They utilize this area to move through because it's easier for them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=92.56s)]
*  They also know that Border Patrol is going to be processing the people that they are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=95.6s)]
*  pushing through. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=99.84s)]
*  This is what's so incredible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=101.88s)]
*  It's as if the Biden administration is aiding and abetting the drug cartels and the human [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=103.84s)]
*  traffickers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=109.56s)]
*  They're working in sync. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=110.56s)]
*  And we've seen it all day, Kelly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=112.28s)]
*  I've been watching busloads of migrants, illegal immigrants come in and then they've been pushing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=113.84s)]
*  them out and sending them out on private buses to other parts of the state where they will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=120.68s)]
*  then push them out into airplanes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=125.56s)]
*  Some of them are private. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=128.52s)]
*  Some of them are commercial aircraft like Delta, American Airlines. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=130.02s)]
*  We've seen that all online where they take them out and they fly them out to cities like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Philadelphia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=139.52s)]
*  The biggest concern right now is the special interest aliens as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  These special interest aliens that are coming from Mali, from Senegal, from Bangladesh, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  from other areas of the world like Sierra Leone are not being properly vetted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  They are coming into the country and they are being set free. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=155.08s)]
*  And even if we run background checks on them, Kelly, if they pass a background check in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=158.68s)]
*  the United States, which they more than likely will, they'll be let go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  And this is what is concerning to law enforcement here on the ground as well as intelligence [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=168.2s)]
*  officials that are monitoring this situation in the FBI all the way to overseas when we're [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=173.32s)]
*  dealing with CIA and other Western intelligence agencies that say that we are putting our [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=179.72s)]
*  nation in a massive predicament and we are exposing our citizens to a national security [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  threat that is unmeasurable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, it really is incredible. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=194.04s)]
*  And you can find your way there, but Joe Biden and his borders are, Kamala Harris somehow [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=195.56s)]
*  can't. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=199.72s)]
*  And Stephen Miller, I wonder why that is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=200.72s)]
*  I mean, clearly, President Biden has great political risk here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=203.12s)]
*  If he doesn't have the compassion, if he doesn't have the guts and the courage and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=207.32s)]
*  the strength as our commander in chief and our president, can he actually look at what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=211.44s)]
*  a liability this is for his election since the Democrats seem to care most about that? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=215.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris too, I mean, Stephen, you remember when we were in the White House together, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=221.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris and eight or nine other Democrats running for president in 2019 went to a teenage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=224.12s)]
*  migrant facility in Homestead, Florida. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=229.6s)]
*  And this is what they do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=232.6s)]
*  They preen, they pander, they pretend to care about people while they're running for president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=233.6s)]
*  And Kamala Harris went down to Homestead, Florida. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=237.94s)]
*  I'm going to call for the tweet that she put up after that in June of 2019 so we can [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=239.88s)]
*  say it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=244.16s)]
*  She said, I went to the Homestead detention center to see firsthand the horror of Trump's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=245.16s)]
*  family separation policy and was denied entry under the Harris administration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=250.56s)]
*  I will end all for-profit detention centers and ensure kids are where they belong with [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  their families. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=260.16s)]
*  She can't go down to the southern border now for some unknown reason. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=261.36s)]
*  When she went, she wasn't even close to the border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  She was in Texas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=268.2s)]
*  But Stephen, I mean, I'm wondering about the political implications. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=269.2s)]
*  And I want you to also tell us what can a president do, a different president and vice [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=272.32s)]
*  president in the first days or weeks or months of a new administration that actually would [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  make a difference for what Bill and Sarah are seeing and reporting? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  Let me start with the point about kids to show how shameless and remorseless this administration [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=287.44s)]
*  is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=292.64s)]
*  The number of unaccompanied minors coming across the border, these are people 17 and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=293.64s)]
*  under who are traveling alone, who are often sold into sexual slavery, labor trafficked, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=297.84s)]
*  and who are put into terribly inhumane conditions involving sexual assault and battery. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=304.24s)]
*  The numbers coming across in those demographics are two and three times the highest levels [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  recorded in American history. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Probably half a million minors have been smuggled or trafficked across the border without any [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=317.68s)]
*  adult other than the individual smuggling or trafficking them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=322.92s)]
*  Those individuals now, by the tens of thousands, are completely lost, gone and missing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=327.62s)]
*  That is a moral stain on the conscience of this country for which Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=333.8s)]
*  Harris are 100% solely responsible. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=338.72s)]
*  As for the political risk, it is enormous, but it does require the Republican Party to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  get in the game and do its job, to be on top of this every hour of every day of every week [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=347.94s)]
*  with the moral urgency this situation demands. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  That you and I were there when President Trump secured the border and what he handed over [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=358.24s)]
*  to the next administration was a remain in Mexico policy that worked tremendously, safe [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=362.48s)]
*  third agreements that shut down asylum fraud, border security partnerships all around the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  world to expedite and speed deportations and enhanced ICE authorities to remove illegal [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=372.8s)]
*  aliens as rapidly from the country as humanly possible, and of course, Title 42. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  These policies together sealed that border shut tighter than a submarine hatch. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=383.24s)]
*  every single one of those policies by choice, by deliberate design to mass resettle and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=389.28s)]
*  release millions of illegal aliens into this country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=395.2s)]
*  On day one, a future president, as President Trump has said he would, you put back in place [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=397.84s)]
*  every single one of those policies and then you begin the process of removing every single [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=404.67999999999995s)]
*  person that Joe Biden illegally allowed into this country. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=409.64s)]
*  That is how you seal it shut again. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=413.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller, my former White House colleague who had immigration and national and border [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=415.72s)]
*  security in his vast portfolio, and Sarah Carter joining us from Eagle Pass, Texas. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=419.72s)]
*  Thank you both very much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cv_z6F9f8&t=424.52000000000004s)]
