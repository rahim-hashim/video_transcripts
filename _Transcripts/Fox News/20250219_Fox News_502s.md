# Kristi Noem: President Trump is allowing deportation in record numbers
**Fox News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk)
*  And breaking moments ago, President Donald Trump landing at Joint Base [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=0.0s)]
*  Andrews, a delivered remarks in Miami. We are told that he spoke with the press. As [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=4.86s)]
*  that gets fed into us, we will bring it to you momentarily. Now the Department of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=10.76s)]
*  Homeland Security has a message for illegal immigrants. Get out before you [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=15.32s)]
*  deported. And anyone thinking of coming here illegally should think again. Take a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=19.76s)]
*  look. If you try to enter illegally, you will be caught. You will be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=24.28s)]
*  removed and you will never return. Follow the law and you'll find opportunity. If [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=29.8s)]
*  you break it, you'll find consequences. Now the new ad campaign comes as the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=35.32s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security is trying to figure out the source of leaks [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=41.56s)]
*  that have disrupted ICE enforcement operations around the country. The [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=45.36s)]
*  department is now warning that polygraph tests have been ordered to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=49.32s)]
*  determine whether or not staff were involved in any of these leaks. And the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=52.96s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, joins us now with all the latest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=57.24s)]
*  First things first, we know these leaks have occurred, correct? We're 100% sure [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=60.96s)]
*  of that. Correct. Yes, we do have leaks that have occurred in the last couple of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=67.48s)]
*  weeks that have jeopardized operations that we've had in different areas, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=72.12s)]
*  different cities and towns, and they have put law enforcement officers and our [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=76.16s)]
*  agents at risk. So we won't tolerate it anymore and we're going to use every [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=80.68s)]
*  tool that I have available to me to find out where they're coming from and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=84.8s)]
*  make sure that those who have leaked will face consequences. And you hit the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=87.92s)]
*  keywords, it's putting ICE agents' lives at risk because the element of surprise [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=93.24s)]
*  is now gone. Do you have suspicions where it's coming from? Because you did speak [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=98.24s)]
*  briefly in the past about that. By the way, the president has just arrived, he's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  leaving, he's departing Air Force One now. I see that and I'm glad that he's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=110.12s)]
*  back. But what I would say is that we are in a situation where, yes, I do [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=115.04s)]
*  have suspicions, but I need to be sure and I need to be certain. So we have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  different tools we can use and one of those is ensuring that we're using [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=123.2s)]
*  polygraphs to look at all of our employees, all of our people involved in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=127.0s)]
*  these operations to make sure that they are telling the truth on what they have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  done in the past that may have jeopardized some of our operations. That [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=134.84s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security is a national security agency. It's a law [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=138.84s)]
*  enforcement agency. So this is one of the authorities that I have and I'm [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=142.52s)]
*  going to use it to make sure that we find those who have done this nefarious [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  activity and that it will no longer be tolerated. You know, a lot of people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=150.96s)]
*  on the left and a lot of Democrats, they're scratching their head, they can't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=155.52s)]
*  really figure out, well, what happened in November? How big a part, they lied [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  about the economy, they lied about Joe's cognitive state, they protected the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=163.56s)]
*  Biden syndicate and then they lied about immigration repeatedly, your [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=167.6s)]
*  predecessor telling the American people, President Joe Biden, Vice President [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris, the border is closed, the border is secure. I mean, it's such a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=177.16s)]
*  spectacular lie. Did they think the American people didn't have eyes to see? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=181.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, the people could see because it was changing in their communities [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=186.56s)]
*  right around them and we watched families lose their children. We saw [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=190.76s)]
*  families like Lake and Riley's family that tragically lost a daughter that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=194.48s)]
*  they'll never have in their lives again. They saw children that were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=198.28s)]
*  trafficked, drugs that were killing our generation of kids and it was all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=201.44s)]
*  happening because of that open border. So the American people knew what was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  happening and saw it and there was consequences for that and now we have a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=208.48s)]
*  president that puts America first and that has closed the border, has secured [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  it and is allowing us to deport people in record numbers and we are deporting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=216.76s)]
*  dangerous criminals. In fact, Sean, we're picking up people that have been raping [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=222.04s)]
*  children, have been trafficking children and proliferating the use of drugs and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=226.54s)]
*  going out there and, you know, murdering and raping individuals and we're getting [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  them out of the country. Every day we're saving lives because of the work that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=236.92s)]
*  we're doing and so we're going to make sure that we do it and do it with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  integrity and continue to make sure that we're securing the homeland of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=243.06s)]
*  United States of America. You know, the thing, Madam Secretary, that scares me the most is that we have... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=246.6s)]
*  I thought you said Madam Secretary was scaring you. No, no, no. And you did a great job as governor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=255.6s)]
*  I'm sure the people of South Dakota are proud of you but also probably miss you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=263.96s)]
*  But the thing that scares me the most is, well, first of all, do we have an actual [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=266.84s)]
*  number of how many illegals were unvetted, allowed in the country? Do we [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=272.72s)]
*  have any idea the number of known terrorists? We know we have terrorists. We [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  know Biden and Harris admitted, you know, around 15,000 murderers and then we had [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  about the same number of rapists and other violent criminals. We have cartel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=286.56s)]
*  members, gang members. Do we know about how many and how do we ever, how do we [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  root out every single one of them? Because every one of them to me [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=296.32s)]
*  represents a threat to the homeland. We have hundreds of thousands of criminals [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  that were let illegally into this country. That means they have criminal [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=306.0s)]
*  records. They've perpetuated crimes in this country. They're members of gangs [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=309.4s)]
*  and cartels that have committed crimes around the world and tomorrow is the day [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=313.64s)]
*  that we're going to be able to make sure that gangs and cartel members are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=318.88s)]
*  foreign terrorist organizations and it'll give us new authorities to go [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=322.64s)]
*  after them and get them out of the country. So this is not a small operation, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=326.12s)]
*  Sean. This is an operation that we're going to have to work aggressively at [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=329.6s)]
*  for a period of time to make sure that we're getting all those dangerous [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  individuals out of our country and then go on to those who have overstayed and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  have final removal orders. We're going to go forward and make sure that our [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=342.0s)]
*  federal laws are upheld and that every single law is followed in this country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=345.0s)]
*  The Biden administration didn't do that. They didn't ensure that the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  American people were their number one priority and that's why we're in the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=353.12s)]
*  situation that we're in today. So what keeps me up at night is the fact that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  until we get all of these dangerous individuals out of the country, I can't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=360.12s)]
*  ensure that we won't have another family that loses a child because of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  these people that were let into the country by the Biden administration. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=369.12s)]
*  That we have families that may still lose their kids and grandkids to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  fentanyl and to drugs because it's being trafficked over the border by, you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=376.16s)]
*  know, the cartels that are partnering with the Chinese government to take out [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=380.88s)]
*  our next generation. They're weakening and destroying America from the inside [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=384.36s)]
*  and it's my job as secretary to make sure that I'm stopping it and getting up [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  every single day using every tool that I have to make sure that we're making [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=392.76s)]
*  America more safe. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=395.76s)]
*  You know, do we have a total number or around a total number? I've heard [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=396.92s)]
*  estimates, 10 million, 11 million, 14 million. Do we even know? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=402.36s)]
*  Well, you've heard the president talk about the fact that there are 20 million [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=406.2s)]
*  people in this country here illegally but we literally do have hundreds of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  thousands of people that are criminal aliens. We have many, over thousands of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  them that are on the suspected or known terrorist watch list. We know that we [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  have thousands of gang members, just TDA members. We have, we're using Gitmo, you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=424.32000000000005s)]
*  know, as a detention center right now and our camp five and six are full of TDA [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=429.36s)]
*  members, entire gang members that were getting out of this country and off of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  our streets. So these are individuals that are the worst of the worst from [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  other countries that President Biden invited to come to America and other [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=441.12s)]
*  countries sent them to us. We are now sending them back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=445.88s)]
*  And by the way, currently the Department of Homeland Security, you do [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=450.16s)]
*  administer polygraphs during the hiring process for CBP officers, agents for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=454.52s)]
*  suitability for employment. This, you know, this is overreach, this is too much. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=460.88s)]
*  They're going to check if people, you already do that when they get hired, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=465.2s)]
*  don't you? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=468.56s)]
*  Absolutely. And we're a national security agency. We're a law enforcement agency. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=469.72s)]
*  We have the authority to do this and we'll continue to do it. It'll be random. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=474.56s)]
*  It'll be a process that we'll use to make sure that we're not going to allow [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  these leaks anymore. And we'll be able to use it when we have suspected [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=482.16s)]
*  activities going on as well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=485.08s)]
*  All right. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, we [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=487.52s)]
*  appreciate that update. Thanks for your time as well. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=490.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aqOCYiJBk&t=499.56s)]
