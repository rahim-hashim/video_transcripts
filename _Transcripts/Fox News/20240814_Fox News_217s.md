# Vivek Ramaswamy: Kamala Harris is one of the most radical nominees we have seen
**Fox News:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA)
*  All right, fake news CNN anchor Kaitlyn Collins yesterday appeared on Stephen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=0.0s)]
*  Colbert's show and Colbert made a joke that was actually funny for once except [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=4.92s)]
*  he was trying to be serious. I'm serious, take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I know you guys are objective over there that you just report the news as it is. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=13.68s)]
*  I know, I know, CNN makes it... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Was that supposed to be a laugh line? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=21.0s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to be, but I guess it is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a laugh line. Not even liberals in that audience believe [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=27.0s)]
*  that fake news CNN is objective. Anyway, here was reaction. Former 2024 GOP [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=31.6s)]
*  presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. You see, all of the lying, all of the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  distortion, all of the media protection, and now we're back to square one and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  that is now we've got 34 days before early voting starts and the American [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  public is not aware of who Kamala Harris or Tim Walz are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=54.52s)]
*  Well that's exactly part of the plan, Sean, is the reality is that Kamala Harris never went through the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=58.52s)]
*  primary process where she had to cater to the left so now she gets to appear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=64.76s)]
*  like she's in the center when in fact she's one of the most radical nominees [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=68.92s)]
*  we've seen from the Democratic Party. There's exactly one reason she's rising [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  in the polls. It's because the media is propping her up and our formula to win [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=76.12s)]
*  this Sean is ultimately we got to take this back to our vision for policy in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=80.68s)]
*  the future of the United States. If we do that we win, if we steer from that path [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  we lose. I think it's that simple and you know what the media does present an [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  uphill battle but it's up to us to actually overcome that and to win. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=93.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm in favor of. You see, I agree we've had this discussion about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  inflation and the economy and illegal immigration and open borders and law and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  order and energy and America's you know role in the world we've talked about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=106.56s)]
*  that but doesn't there also have to be an information process where the American [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=111.08s)]
*  people become fully acquainted with who they both are, what they both said in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  their own words and how they're changing and flipping and flopping and flailing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=120.92s)]
*  Absolutely and if the media is not doing their job that job then falls to us. To [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=126.64s)]
*  explain to Americans Kamala Harris has stood consistently for single-payer [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  health care and nationalization of the US health care system. She favors [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=135.0s)]
*  abolishing private health insurance. That means if you like the private health [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=138.68s)]
*  insurance plan you're on right now under her you won't have access to that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=142.4s)]
*  because she favors a single government-ordained plan. She actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=146.16s)]
*  favored changing the filibuster in the Senate to ram through a Green New Deal [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=149.92s)]
*  that would replace aviation travel with rail travel. She favors a tax on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  unrealized capital gains which means that people across this country will [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=158.52s)]
*  actually have to pay taxes with cash they don't even have. That's farmers, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=162.56s)]
*  that's small business owners across the country. So yes should the media be [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=166.84s)]
*  questioning Kamala Harris and explaining her views to the public? Absolutely. Are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=170.56s)]
*  they doing that? No they're not. That leaves one option though Sean because we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  have a country to save we don't have a long time to do it. So it falls on us not [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=178.48s)]
*  just to complain about the media failing but for us to now step up and explain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=182.28s)]
*  that to the American people ourselves to make sure we get the right president in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=186.16s)]
*  office. That's gonna be Donald Trump. Well I've got all of it on my website [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=189.6s)]
*  Hannity.com. You can literally get it for free you can send it out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=194.0s)]
*  and blast it out and bypass this corrupt media. That's a big part of it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=198.6s)]
*  Alright Vivek thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbSZT-HQOA&t=202.88s)]
