# Hannity: Democrats have a math problem
**Fox News:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns)
*  Now, to some actual drama at Rock Center. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  It's no secret NBC News is in the tank for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=2.44s)]
*  But now, by the way, that's the network that is running—that called Madison Square Garden, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=6.68s)]
*  that event, a Nazi rally and showed images of Nazis on their network. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=11.8s)]
*  Anyway, the network accused of violating a federal equal time rule after Kamala's recent [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=18.6s)]
*  appearance on Saturday Night Live. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=23.78s)]
*  Here to explain, Fox News contributor Joe Concha, former White House Chief of Staff [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=25.8s)]
*  Reince Priebus. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=30.04s)]
*  We'll start with you, Joe, on the issue of NBC. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=31.04s)]
*  And my understanding is they might be offering other time to Donald Trump, but they certainly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=36.08s)]
*  didn't invite him on Saturday Night Live. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=40.16s)]
*  Correct, Sean. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=42.56s)]
*  So Donald Trump was not invited to go on Saturday Night Live. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=44.72s)]
*  Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of that show for the last 50 years, said that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=48.2s)]
*  he would not invite either candidate on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=53.96s)]
*  And then sure enough, there's Kamala Harris there last night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=57.32s)]
*  Donald Trump was not invited. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=60.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter, actually, because not a lot of people watch that show anymore. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=62.68s)]
*  The bottom line is, Sean, that Kamala Harris has nothing to run on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=67.04s)]
*  Even we're talking about, you know, comedy shows. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=71.04s)]
*  Can she run on the economy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=73.56s)]
*  No. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=75.0s)]
*  Can she run on wages increasing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=76.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=77.44s)]
*  Can she run on the prices of food or gas or anything going down? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=78.44s)]
*  No. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=83.88s)]
*  Can she run on violent crime being reduced? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=84.88s)]
*  No. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Can she run on the border as her role as borders are? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  So how about the wars overseas? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=92.24s)]
*  Or should boys compete against girls and youth in college sports? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=94.8s)]
*  No. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's message is clear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  To remind voters of his record while in office, while Kamala Harris wants you to ignore her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=102.28s)]
*  record in office, which continues to this day. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  She never says what she means. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=111.32s)]
*  She never means what she says. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=113.04s)]
*  She can go on Saturday Night Live and have that airtime fine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=115.28s)]
*  It's not going to matter, quite frankly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is poised to win here because not only is Kamala Harris a profoundly horrible [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=120.56s)]
*  candidate, unions don't trust her, the teamsters don't trust her, UAA in terms of culinary, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=126.28s)]
*  black voters, Hispanic voters, she does not have those votes there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=133.12s)]
*  I'm bullish on Trump right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=136.84s)]
*  I don't care what happens on Saturday Night Live because, quite frankly, he is in position [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  to win based on the conditions on the ground and the fact that Kamala Harris is not Joe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=142.8s)]
*  Biden and not a very good candidate for that matter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=147.44s)]
*  Reince Priebus, let's go to what I was discussing with Laura Trump for a minute here, and that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  is in terms of early voting, Democrats clearly have a math problem. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  You can hear the vitriol now coming out of them, fascist, racist, Nazi, et cetera, et [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  cetera. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=170.36s)]
*  It's interesting to me, and you know Wisconsin, use Wisconsin maybe as an example of a lot [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=171.64s)]
*  of the swing states, they are not meeting the numbers that they would need to win. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=175.7s)]
*  Their percentages are down and percentages compared to Republicans are way down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=181.44s)]
*  What does that mean for a state like Wisconsin? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=186.88s)]
*  Because to me, where I see Kamala right now, she needs to win all of the blue wall states [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=189.56s)]
*  for her to actually win this election. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=193.88s)]
*  She seems to have one path left in my mind. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=197.72s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  So for the viewers out there on that piece, and I'll get to Wisconsin in a second, barring [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  a surprise in Georgia or North Carolina, basically what you've got to look at is Donald Trump [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  needs to win one of those three states, Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=215.92s)]
*  So things also look good in Nevada for Donald Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=221.0s)]
*  And let me explain what this is about, because we don't really spend any time talking about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=224.44s)]
*  this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  There are buckets of votes that we always talk about. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=230.0s)]
*  There's the early vote bucket, and then there is the election day bucket. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  The parties know exactly, once that early vote is done, who's left in that election [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  day bucket to turn out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Traditionally, the Democrats have always beaten the Republicans on early vote, so traditionally [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=245.16s)]
*  Republicans always have to do better, and they do always do better on election day. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the Democrats hardly ever beat Republicans on election day in any of these battleground [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=254.36s)]
*  states. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=261.88s)]
*  So the early vote is going so poorly for the Democrats, about 40% in Wisconsin, there has [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  been a decrease in early vote by 40% in Wisconsin. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=270.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  It means that the Democrats actually now have to beat the Republicans by a greater percentage [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  than they've ever beaten the Republicans in Wisconsin. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  It is very, very difficult for the Democrats to do that, and it's happening across the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=289.96s)]
*  This is a big topic. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=290.96s)]
*  It could take a long time to explain, but you guys get the picture. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=291.96s)]
*  We're going to watch it carefully, but for the 80 to 90 million people that haven't voted, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  assume your vote wins the election is a deciding vote. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthmsW7K0Ns&t=302.03999999999996s)]
