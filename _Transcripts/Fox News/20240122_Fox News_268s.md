# Sean Hannity: Nikki Haley has an uphill battle in New Hampshire
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo)
*  I'm John Hannity, and tonight we are broadcasting live from Bedford, New Hampshire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=0.0s)]
*  It is the night before the primary, and at this hour we are monitoring what is a huge [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=7.8s)]
*  unity rally in the Granite State, featuring three former 2024 hopefuls, Senator Tim Scott, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=12.88s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, and Governor Doug Burgum is there, along with the current GOP frontrunner [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=19.16s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=24.68s)]
*  We're going to take you there live. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=25.68s)]
*  We should be taking the stage any moment when the 45th president steps up to the podium. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=27.2s)]
*  Now, in the general election, President Trump now leads Biden more than ever. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=32.48s)]
*  Look at this morning consult poll, 2024 tracking. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=36.76s)]
*  And meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Trump is expected to win big in tomorrow's primaries. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  When you look at the Real Clear Politics average, look at this, The Washington Post, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=45.04s)]
*  16-point lead, according to Emerson. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=49.04s)]
*  He's leading by a whopping 27 points, the latest inside advantage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=51.16s)]
*  That would be the Matt Towery poll. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  They nailed it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=59.099999999999994s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  He's up by 22 or more. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  That was 62-37. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  The Boston Globe has him up by 19. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=63.81999999999999s)]
*  The new fake news CNN poll even has him up by 11, and last week it was 7. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  That same CNN poll found that the DeSantis supporters are more likely to back Donald [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump now that the Florida governor has pulled out of this race. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  And while Governor DeSantis won't be the 2024 nominee, let me just say one thing about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=81.5s)]
*  him, his campaign. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=86.98s)]
*  He is without a doubt a leader in our current conservative movement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=88.3s)]
*  He's an American first conservative, one of the most successful governors in Florida's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=92.5s)]
*  history. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=97.78s)]
*  And you might recall, in 2018, Governor DeSantis won the state of Florida by around 30,000 [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=98.78s)]
*  votes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=103.9s)]
*  Four years later, he won re-election by more than 1.5 million. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=104.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=108.94s)]
*  Because he did a great job as governor for the people in the free state of Florida. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=109.94s)]
*  He's a fighter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=114.34s)]
*  He always puts America first. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=115.7s)]
*  He was especially trueâ€”we saw this during the COVID pandemic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=117.06s)]
*  And despite hysteria from the woke mob, he withstood all those attacks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=122.42s)]
*  He was one of the first governors in the country to reject lockdowns. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=126.66s)]
*  He opened schools in August of 2020, and he defended freedom. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=130.26s)]
*  And the free state of Florida is now, well, my new home, on top of everything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=134.42s)]
*  But it is one of the hottest destinations in the world and growing at a very rapid pace. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=139.06s)]
*  And of course, politics is a blood sport. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=144.42s)]
*  During this primary, Governor DeSantis was up against, well, someone that is capable [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  of defying all conventional political gravity. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=152.18s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis is only 45 years old. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  His future, incredibly bright, and Florida, lucky to have him as a governor. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=158.7s)]
*  And now we're down to a two-person race between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=162.86s)]
*  You do have to give Nikki Haley credit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=166.26s)]
*  She is the last challenger standing, but she is in a pretty tough spot as of tonight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=168.78s)]
*  Not only is she losing, according to the Real Clear Politics average, by 18, but she is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=173.66s)]
*  almost down by 30 points in her home state of South Carolina, according to the latest [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=178.3s)]
*  Emerson poll. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  Still, the former governor ambassador is picking up support from an unlikely group of voters, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Biden supporters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=190.9s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=191.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=192.9s)]
*  So have you decided you're going to support on Tuesday? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=193.9s)]
*  Yes, I think I have. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=196.9s)]
*  I think I'm a Nikki supporter. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=197.9s)]
*  Are you open to supporting Joe Biden? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=199.9s)]
*  I am. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=201.9s)]
*  I voted for him in the last election. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  I love the live free or die state. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  I love New Hampshire. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  I love the people of New Hampshire. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't like their voting system. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  Independence, Democrats, they call it an open primary. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  They register as independents. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  Democrats sometimes do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  And then they can vote in the Republican primary. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  Based on multiple reports, Haley has a ton of support from Americans who will likely [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  vote for Biden, regardless if Nikki Haley won here in the New Hampshire primary. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't like that system. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, still, Nikki Haley has an uphill battle in New Hampshire, and Trump is expected to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=232.06s)]
*  win, if you believe the polls. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=237.06s)]
*  But the only poll that really matters, that will be tomorrow's primary. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=238.06s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=242.06s)]
*  But if, in fact, Haley does lose and lose by a pretty big margin, she will have an important [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=243.06s)]
*  decision to make, and that is, does she want to go into her own state and risk losing by [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=248.06s)]
*  a big margin? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=253.06s)]
*  In a moment, we'll take you live to that Trump rally. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=254.06s)]
*  For the hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pAkCbkmLo&t=261.98s)]
