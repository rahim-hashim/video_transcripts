# Stephen A. Smith: I could beat any of these Democrats for president
**Fox News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I)
*  So the Democrats went radical left. They picked new party leaders. They're struggling to find out who to rally behind in 2028. A recent poll of potential presidential nominees shows former vice president Kamala Harris in the lead at 33 percent, followed by former transportation secretary, pothole Pete Buttigieg, at 9 percent, Gavin Newsom at 7 percent, and the recent vice presidential nominee Tim Walz sits at 3 percent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=0.0s)]
*  One point behind him is our friend Stephen A. Smith, who is currently the star of first take on ESPN, and he said he might consider a run. Really, Stephen? Look. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=28.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=39.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=40.0s)]
*  I might entertain running. I just might change my mind one day. I doubt it, but I might. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=44.0s)]
*  Because how much would it take to beat y'all? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=53.0s)]
*  And Trump can't run again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=57.0s)]
*  Now, Stephen A. also has come out strong against Trump recent actions to dismantle the DEI wokeness that took over our government under Biden and, of course, before him, Barack Obama. And he is preparing for a presidential run? Let's ask him. Stephen A., how are you? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=59.0s)]
*  What's going on big time? How are you, man? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=77.0s)]
*  I might entertain running for president. You can't afford the pay cut by your own admission, and if you run, your party would never nominate you because you're far too reasonable, although I have a couple of bones to pick with you tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, number one, you're absolutely right. My lifestyle is quite lovely, and I would not want to ruin that by running for presidency in the United States of America. I have no interest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=96.0s)]
*  But I was just trying to make a profound point, and that is that I think the Democratic Party in the state that they find themselves in, I think somebody like me could actually win. I certainly think that I could beat any of those candidates that you put on the screen. I can tell you that right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=106.0s)]
*  I certainly think if I was running up against somebody like you, I would win that race too. So when you think about the candidates that you possibly go up against... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=120.0s)]
*  If you run, I'm running. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=128.0s)]
*  You run, I'll run. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=129.0s)]
*  Listen, you have no chance in hell of beating me because you're too rigid. You don't have any patience for people that disagree with you. You'd lose your mind. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=130.0s)]
*  You're going to lecture people on patience? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=141.0s)]
*  I'm the man of the people. The American people want it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=144.0s)]
*  I'm the one that wants lower taxes, limited government. I'm the one that wants energy dominance, controlled borders, law and order, better schools. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=148.0s)]
*  You want it all. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=156.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. You're going to lose that debate. Now, but put that aside for a second. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm mad at you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=161.0s)]
*  I'm mad at you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=162.0s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=163.0s)]
*  Okay. You actually said about DEI, what you're really saying when you talk about DEI, what you're really saying is we want white dominance again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=164.0s)]
*  Let me put up on the screen, and this was first instituted, you know, as it relates to the FAA under Barack Obama. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=175.0s)]
*  Their diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=182.0s)]
*  Now, Stephen A., you fly a lot. Do you want people with intellectual and psychiatric disabilities in that control tower? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=191.0s)]
*  Not at all. Not at all. And by the way, quote me, actually. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=200.0s)]
*  Checkmate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=203.0s)]
*  I don't know how many times I have to tell you this. Quote me accurately. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=204.0s)]
*  My issue with the eradication of DEI was not that on its premise. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=207.0s)]
*  It was the explanation that the Trump administration and others were giving about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=211.0s)]
*  I don't want to hear DEI automatically being about people who happen to be minorities that are unqualified. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=217.0s)]
*  That is what I was saying. I said it's one thing to get rid of it altogether. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=224.0s)]
*  It's another thing entirely to articulate and verbalize the position that, excuse me, you know what, everybody that was associated with DEI are unqualified individuals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=228.0s)]
*  We don't want unqualified individuals, particularly in public safety. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=238.0s)]
*  I'm saying that's how people are coming across. That's how people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=242.0s)]
*  Of course we agree on it. Of course we agree on it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=244.0s)]
*  But when you have somebody like Hegseth, for example, let's use him because he was speaking about your former colleague at Fox News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=247.0s)]
*  Hold on. That's not a defense secretary. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=253.0s)]
*  Excuse me. Listen, I respect. Listen, I'm not bringing up anything personal. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=255.0s)]
*  I'm simply saying, my God, Sean, when you're talking about people who are unqualified, I wish him nothing but the best. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=258.0s)]
*  He served our country, you know, in the military. I get all of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=264.0s)]
*  But when you are weak in host on Fox News and now you're the defense secretary of the United States overseeing three and a half million people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=268.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, did you serve in Iraq, Afghanistan and Gitmo? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=276.0s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=281.0s)]
*  Did you go to Harvard? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=282.0s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=283.0s)]
*  Did you go to Princeton? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=284.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=285.0s)]
*  Well, he's certainly a pretty intelligent guy. So I would say. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=286.0s)]
*  I didn't say he wasn't intelligent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=288.0s)]
*  Why don't we give a real soldier an opportunity? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=289.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=291.0s)]
*  OK, that's fair. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=292.0s)]
*  But say that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=293.0s)]
*  One thing I'm not qualified for. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=294.0s)]
*  But say that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=295.0s)]
*  I just said it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=296.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=297.0s)]
*  All right. Last thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=298.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=299.0s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=300.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=301.0s)]
*  I'm not qualified for this and we're going to show it at the end of the show. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=302.0s)]
*  But I'm going to be in a Super Bowl ad and you're at the Super Bowl. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=304.0s)]
*  Oh, God. You in a Super Bowl ad? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=307.0s)]
*  What the hell is this world coming to? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=311.0s)]
*  What kind of Super Bowl ad are you going to be in? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=313.0s)]
*  You and your non-sports knowing self. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=315.0s)]
*  Talk about standing in your lane. That's you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=317.0s)]
*  You in a Super Bowl commercial? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=319.0s)]
*  Who did this? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=321.0s)]
*  Did Trump pull strings to make this happen? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=322.0s)]
*  I mean, what the hell is going on, Fox? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=324.0s)]

*  What do I have to be jealous of? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=336.0s)]
*  I'm in the Super Bowl ad and you're not. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=338.0s)]

*  I mean, my time will come. My time will come. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=344.0s)]
*  Don't worry. I'll be around a long enough time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=346.0s)]

*  That's going to happen. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=353.0s)]
*  All right, last question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=354.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not as big time as you, but it is what it is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=355.0s)]

*  Who do you think is going to win? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=366.0s)]

*  I didn't say I didn't know the answer. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIdYIQEYg-I&t=379.0s)]
