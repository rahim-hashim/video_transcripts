# Vivek Ramaswamy: We could have a landslide
**Fox News:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc)
*  Here with reaction 2024 GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it must be nice if you have all that, all of that security with you and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=4.84s)]
*  you get to walk your little doggy, you know, along the streets of DC. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=9.0s)]
*  I guess you don't have to worry about getting the crap beat out of you or [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=12.34s)]
*  getting your car jacked. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=14.92s)]
*  It's another example of the liberal elite being insulated from the very problems [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=17.92s)]
*  that they create. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=22.16s)]
*  But let me just say a word about this border crisis, Sean. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  The border crisis in our southern border right now is the single greatest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=26.28s)]
*  challenge that this country has faced since 9 11. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=29.68s)]
*  And I don't state that lightly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=33.2s)]
*  You've got 10 million coming over illegally under Biden's tenure alone. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=34.72s)]
*  If you look at broader estimates, that's closer to 20 plus million. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=38.92s)]
*  I think the actual number is going to be well above 20 million illegals in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=42.2s)]
*  United States right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=45.56s)]
*  And even if you assume 99% of them have no criminal intentions, that means 1% [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=47.4s)]
*  does. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=52.4s)]
*  That's 200,000 hardened criminals roaming this country, if not more, as a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=53.08s)]
*  consequence of those loose border policies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=57.08s)]
*  So the relationship between this crime wave and the border crisis, that's not a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=59.76s)]
*  coincidence. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=63.04s)]
*  In fact, I think that we are, I fear, laying the groundwork for even a future [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=64.08s)]
*  event, God forbid, like 9 11, until we get serious and actually do something [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=68.08s)]
*  about it, both sealing that border and deporting anybody who's in this country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  illegally. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=76.84s)]
*  If your first act of entering this country breaks the law, it should be no [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=77.84s)]
*  surprise that many of these people continue to break the law while they're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  And it has to end and it's going to take a new president to deliver that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=84.84s)]
*  So we learned a lot about you in the Republican primary. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=89.04s)]
*  Actually, I learned a lot about you personally on the show is that you like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=92.56s)]
*  verbal combat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=95.84s)]
*  You have no problem mixing it up with people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=96.8s)]
*  We now know what the Democratic plan is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=99.72s)]
*  They'll demagogue abortion, democracy in peril. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=101.72s)]
*  January 6th, Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=105.28s)]
*  transphobic and want dirty air and water. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=110.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=112.44s)]
*  Now the question is they can't run on their record. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=113.48s)]
*  What do you tell Donald Trump? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=116.28s)]
*  What is the best way for not only Donald Trump, but for every Republican that is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=117.8s)]
*  going to be lied about when they demagogue abortion? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=123.28s)]
*  What would you advise them to do? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=126.28s)]
*  How should they answer that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=128.44s)]
*  I would say forget about the other side. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=132.16s)]
*  The other side is full of hypocrisies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=134.16s)]
*  If we're naming their hypocrisies, we'd be busy all day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=136.12s)]
*  Focus on what we actually stand for, that we stand for the idea that nations have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=138.84s)]
*  borders, that you get ahead in this country based on merit, not on the color of your [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=143.32s)]
*  skin, that we're actually the party that believes in free speech. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=147.28s)]
*  That used to be liberals 40 years ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the conservative movement today, that you get to speak your mind [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  openly in this country as long as I get to in return, that we believe in a justice [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=155.84s)]
*  system that doesn't favor conservatives, but doesn't favor people just because [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  they're part of the Democratic Party either. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=163.68s)]
*  That's what we believe and stand for. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=165.48s)]
*  And I think part of the reason we didn't have that red wave in 2022, Sean, they [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=167.76s)]
*  tried to blame Trump, they tried to blame a lot of other issues. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  No, the reason we didn't have it is that we have to define what we stand for. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=174.6s)]
*  We can't just criticize Biden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=178.12s)]
*  That's my advice to Republicans running up ballot and down ballot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=180.12s)]
*  Here's our actual alternative. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=183.68s)]
*  Let me take a little issue with you on this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=185.56s)]
*  And we're going to unite the country more than the other guys will. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=187.12s)]
*  I agree with everything you said about you've got to run on a platform and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=190.24s)]
*  certainly pointing out Biden's failures. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=195.56s)]
*  It's not going to be hard. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=197.48s)]
*  You know, how is the border working out for you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=198.88s)]
*  How is defund, dismantle, no bail laws working out for you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  How do you like paying five hundred and I'm sorry, five dollars and fifty cents a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=203.92s)]
*  gallon for gasoline in California right now? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=208.44s)]
*  All of these things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=212.04s)]
*  Are you happy with America abdicating its role on the world stage as the leader of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=213.04s)]
*  the free world and abandoning Israel in the war on terror? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=217.6s)]
*  However, where I might disagree with you is here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  I would argue any Republican running for office, if you're being lied about, you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  better fight back and you better hit them hard and you better know, let those [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=229.92s)]
*  voters know that you're being lied about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=235.0s)]
*  And I think Republicans are too timid sometimes to call out a lie when it is a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=237.6s)]
*  blatant lie. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And if they do that, I think they're risking being defined by a corrupt lying [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  opponent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=247.92s)]
*  So, Sean, I wouldn't say we disagree, but I would say we build on that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  As you know, from watching me on the campaign trail, I'm not afraid of calling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=253.32s)]
*  out a lot of the mainstream media to their face for those lies. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  But that's all I would say is that's not enough. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the foundation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=261.4s)]
*  Yeah, we've had some fun, I would say, on air. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  That's good. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=265.76s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=266.76s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=267.76s)]
*  You can't take it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=268.76s)]
*  But I would say this is the unique part of this election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=270.76s)]
*  This is historic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  And I just want to say this on a positive note. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  We only get this once in a century where voters get to choose between two presidents who [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  have both been the president before. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  That doesn't happen usually. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  It was Grover Cleveland the last time around. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  So that's a unique opportunity in this election that voters have at the top of the ticket [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=287.68s)]
*  to say it's not a challenger to Biden who's offering you hopes and dreams. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=291.0s)]
*  It's a challenger to Biden who's already done it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=294.96s)]
*  Compare four years of Trump to four years of Biden. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=297.32s)]
*  That's a once in a century opportunity. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=300.0s)]
*  And if voters sees that, I think we can have a landslide that unites this country. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=301.76s)]
*  That's what this country needs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=306.64s)]
*  And as Donald Trump has said, and I love it when he says this, success will be our vengeance. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=307.64s)]
*  That's how we're going to be the party. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=312.64s)]
*  Biden promised to unite the country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=314.16s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=315.8s)]
*  That's what Republicans are going to do this year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=316.92s)]
*  And I think that's how we're going to make our nation greater than it's ever been before, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=318.48s)]
*  so that our best days are still ahead of us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=324.36s)]
*  And remember this, the one thing they cannot run on is are you better off than you were [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=326.32s)]
*  four years ago? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=331.36s)]
*  Because I can't think of a single policy success of Joe Biden. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=333.24s)]
*  Vivek, I look forward to our next round of verbal combat. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMF_0z5oAFc&t=341.08000000000004s)]
