# Sean Hannity: Every Republican should be strongly opposed to this
**Fox News:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Monday night and tonight Oregon officials, they have declared a state of emergency in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  the city of Portland tonight over the growing fentanyl crisis. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=12.16s)]
*  By the way, only a few years after the state largely decriminalized these hard drugs, our [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=15.6s)]
*  very own Sarah Carter live on the ground in Portland with a full report. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=21.04s)]
*  So finally, by the way, I mean finally, a good moment at the Grammys. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=25.52s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=30.16s)]
*  Will this moment possibly lessen the political divide as many on social media seem to think? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=31.16s)]
*  Well, we'll let you decide yourself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=36.36s)]
*  All right, but first tonight, the U.S. Senate, they have released their long awaited border [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=38.12s)]
*  legislation and by the way, it's not just about borders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=42.16s)]
*  It's about Ukraine funding 60 billion more and about Israel funding only 14 billion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Now this bill does absolutely nothing to secure the border. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=52.96s)]
*  It would be an unmitigated disaster and by the way, every Republican should strongly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=58.24s)]
*  be opposed to this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=63.32s)]
*  It would mandate legal representation for all illegal immigrants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=64.76s)]
*  It adds 50,000 extra employment and family reunification visas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=68.92s)]
*  It gives Biden the power to funnel asylum claims to ports of entry if more than 5,000 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=74.4s)]
*  illegal immigrants cross each day for seven days after which the ports must process a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  minimum of 1,400 claims a day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=87.28s)]
*  And what's worse is the power can only be used for a limited number of days and sunsets [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=90.44s)]
*  after three years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=96.66s)]
*  That's just the headlines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  In his celebration of the deal, far left Connecticut, Senator Chris Murphy said the quiet part out [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=99.44s)]
*  loud on Twitter writing, the border never closes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  But get this, the one provision in the bill actually allows Biden and gives him the power [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=109.0s)]
*  to not abide by the emergency shutdown authority if he doesn't want to. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  So saying it, quote, authorizes the president to suspend the border emergency on an emergency [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=120.44s)]
*  basis for up to 45 days if it's in the national interest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=127.08s)]
*  Well, it could be written up as the basically codifying into law all of Biden's aiding [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=131.68s)]
*  and abetting of illegal immigration into this country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=138.96s)]
*  Former President Trump, whose policies led to the most secure border in history, the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=142.28s)]
*  one that Joe Biden inherited, well, called it a horrendous bill and a gift to Democrats. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Personally, I'm really having a hard time understanding even why. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=153.28s)]
*  For the Senate Republicans out there, why would you ever negotiate this deal? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=157.48s)]
*  Biden doesn't need legislation to fix the border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=162.08s)]
*  We've been saying this over and over again. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=165.2s)]
*  Biden's claim otherwise is a flat out lie and nothing more than a blatant attempt to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=167.48s)]
*  shift the blame for the crisis onto Republicans, if they're stupid enough to allow that to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=172.56s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=177.04s)]
*  Now, Biden was handed the most secure border in our nation's history. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=178.04s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen in his first hundred days, Biden revoked all of Donald Trump's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=181.64s)]
*  efforts to exclude illegal immigrants from the census. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=186.44s)]
*  He strengthened DACA. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=190.84s)]
*  He entered Trump's interior enforcement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=192.36s)]
*  He halted border wall construction. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=194.6s)]
*  He ended the Remain in Mexico policy, which is extremely successful. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=196.72s)]
*  He also let Title 42 expire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=200.68s)]
*  Joe does not need Congress to fix that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=203.76s)]
*  He can reinstate those policies on his own, just as he undid them with the stroke of a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=206.52s)]
*  pen. He doesn't need congressional legislation to do that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=212.44s)]
*  But obviously, Biden is not serious about fixing this manmade crisis of his. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=215.92s)]
*  On top of that, the House already passed a very strong border security bill that's called [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=221.6s)]
*  H.R. 2. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  Why didn't the Senate simply take up H.R. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  2 and make it part of their big package? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=230.16s)]
*  Although I don't like the idea, I think every bill should stand on its own merits. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=232.16s)]
*  I don't think foreign policy funding should be connected to the border in any way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=236.0s)]
*  I don't think Ukraine should be impacted by a border bill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  This bill would enact the necessary steps to secure our border again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  That's H.R. 2. Meanwhile, a CBP source that tells Fox bill of Mollusion tonight that the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=248.32s)]
*  day the legislation was released, there were over 6000 illegal immigrant encounters at [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  the southern border, including 160 Chinese nationals that were apprehended apprehended [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=261.6s)]
*  in the San Diego sector. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=267.32s)]
*  Now, a regular occurrence of recent weeks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  We've talked about over 26000 Chinese nationals in this country, over 12000 from Russia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  And what about the ones from Iran and Syria and Egypt and Afghanistan? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=277.36s)]
*  Why are Chinese nationals pouring over the border in southern California? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=281.92s)]
*  The problem now has become so bad that even the liberal media can no longer ignore it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=287.36s)]
*  Take a look at the 60 minute segment from last night. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=292.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=294.88s)]
*  The number of migrants arriving at the southern border is unprecedented. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=295.96s)]
*  Last year, U.S. customs and border protection recorded two and a half million instances of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=300.28s)]
*  detaining or turning away people attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=306.2s)]
*  So what's the fastest growing group among them? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=312.52s)]
*  Chinese migrants. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=315.68s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=317.2s)]
*  Chinese. We saw large groups, including many from the middle class, come through a four [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=318.52s)]
*  foot gap at the end of a border fence 60 miles east of San Diego. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=324.88s)]
*  The illegal entryway is a new route for those hoping to live in America. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=330.04s)]
*  Look at New York City, where the governor, Kathy Hogle, where the mayor, Eric Adams of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=335.52s)]
*  New York City welcomed illegal immigrants with open arms. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=340.44s)]
*  We are open. We're a sanctuary state. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=343.8s)]
*  Well, it's wreaking havoc in New York this morning. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=346.68s)]
*  New York City police officers, they conducted a raid on a Venezuelan gang tied to dozens [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=349.2s)]
*  of robberies and, of course, the brutal assault on NYPD officers last week and showing [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=354.64s)]
*  just how truly out of touch he is. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  New York City Mayor Adams attended the raid and the press conference thereafter appearing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=363.4s)]
*  to wear a Fendi scarf. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Reportedly, that scarf cost nearly seven hundred dollars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=371.2s)]
*  I'm glad he's making a lot of money doing a lousy job. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3znMVm8CsM&t=374.84s)]
