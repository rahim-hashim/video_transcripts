# Brooke Goldstein: Weâ€™re at a crossroads right now
**Fox News:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk)
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, executive director of the Lawfare [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=0.0s)]
*  Project, Brooke Goldstein. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=4.96s)]
*  Brooke, she decided to boycott. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=6.72s)]
*  It was done on purpose. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=9.48s)]
*  She's caving to the radical left in her party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  How does this play out? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=13.84s)]
*  TARABLY. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=15.44s)]
*  First of all, Sean, I want to thank you for having me on tonight to discuss what I believe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=16.44s)]
*  to be a historic speech on behalf of the prime minister of Israel, because, as he said, we [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=21.04s)]
*  are at a crossroads right now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=27.62s)]
*  The future of Western civilization depends on whether or not the United States helps [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=29.42s)]
*  Israel defeat Hamas and radical Islamist terrorism, or, on the other hand, opens its borders, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=35.7s)]
*  allows pro-Hamas mobs and pro-Hamas money into this country to politicize the Democratic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  Party and to radicalize our population. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=49.66s)]
*  Because I'm not worried about whether or not Israel's going to win its multi-fronted war [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=52.94s)]
*  against Iran and its proxies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=57.42s)]
*  I'm worried about whether the United States is going to win its multi-fronted war against [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=59.7s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=64.98s)]
*  I'm worried about the fact that the president, sorry, the vice president of the United States, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=65.98s)]
*  Kamala Harris, running for president, has expressed support for pro-terror mobs that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=70.54s)]
*  not only tear down and burn American flags, but then hoist up the flag of the Islamic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=76.26s)]
*  state of Palestine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=82.5s)]
*  Her own daughter is a radical activist. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=83.98s)]
*  I'm worried about the fact that our border, as today was confirmed during the FBI director's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=87.7s)]
*  testimony by Congressman Gates, that Hamas and Hezbollah have infiltrated our borders [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=92.46s)]
*  to carry out terrorist attacks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=99.86s)]
*  This is what concerns me the most. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=102.1s)]
*  And the smartest thing that Netanyahu said today was that this is not about Israel-Hamas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=103.82s)]
*  This is a war, and has always been a war, between Iran and the United States, between [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=108.86s)]
*  civilization and barbarism. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=114.34s)]
*  And until we stop the radicalization, the hate indoctrination happening throughout the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=116.9s)]
*  Middle East, there will not be peace. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=122.5s)]
*  Ari, civilization versus barbarism, Iran's useful idiots. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=125.22s)]
*  She said this was a boycott. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=132.1s)]
*  It's beyond disappointing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=133.86s)]
*  If I was Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, the governor there, I would take myself out of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=136.14s)]
*  consideration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=141.78s)]
*  I would not be a part of this radicalized ticket. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=143.14s)]
*  I would not be a part of that administration under any circumstances. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=146.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a distinct possibility whoever gets attached to Kamala Harris is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=149.94s)]
*  going to lose bigger than Kamala Harris being attached to Joe Biden. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=155.7s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the instant polls, she's not doing any better than Joe Biden. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=158.78s)]
*  Now, it's early, but let's see what that pattern holds. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=163.46s)]
*  But Sean, on the speech itself, what a tour de force Netanyahu delivered today from a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=165.9s)]
*  moral point of view. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  When he talked about the land and whose land it is, and he went back 4,000 years to Abraham, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=172.66s)]
*  Isaac, Jacob, David, King David, Solomon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=178.62s)]
*  What a grounding in the ancient, legitimate land that is the Israelis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=184.3s)]
*  And then what happened today in Washington? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden gives an address to the nation and doesn't say anything to condemn those protests [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  in Washington that were far worse than anything that happened in Charlottesville, the thing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=198.34s)]
*  that allegedly motivated him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=202.34s)]
*  He sat there silent. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=204.6s)]
*  Where was Kamala Harris today condemning those protests that, as Brooke pointed out, raised [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=206.14s)]
*  a foreign flag, a Palestinian flag in Washington, D.C.? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  They sit there silent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=216.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party sits there silent on all issues important to Israel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=217.36s)]
*  And this is a fundamental change in the American electorate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=222.12s)]
*  Yeah, Josh Shapiro is proudly Zionist. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=224.8s)]
*  That's why he's going to have a difficult, difficult time fitting in in the modern-day [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=228.0s)]
*  Democratic National Party. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, these are Iran's useful idiots. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=235.96s)]
*  It's embarrassing for our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=238.68s)]
*  It is sad. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=240.56s)]
*  They have no moral clarity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=241.56s)]
*  We had moral clarity in Congress today, and that came from the prime minister of Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=243.16s)]
*  Maybe his finest moment, his finest speech ever. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=248.4s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVIch3I1gYk&t=251.96s)]
