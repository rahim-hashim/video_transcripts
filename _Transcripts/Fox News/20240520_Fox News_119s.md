# Alina Habba: They are desperate
**Fox News:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE)
*  with more also in the courtroom today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump legal spokesperson Alina Haber. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=2.92s)]
*  I want to get your perspective watching this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=5.32s)]
*  this Adam Schiff show unfold today, Alina. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=8.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great way to refer to it, Sean. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=12.88s)]
*  It is a show, it's a Biden show trial, that's for sure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=15.56s)]
*  If you look at the audience that's sitting there, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=18.36s)]
*  if you look at the lack of evidence [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=20.2s)]
*  and you look at how they are literally floundering [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=21.84s)]
*  because they have no case and it's coming out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=25.0s)]
*  You know, there was something that occurred to me today [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=27.88s)]
*  and I was speaking to some people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  and I'm sitting there listening to this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=31.96s)]
*  and I think the American people [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=34.12s)]
*  need to remember something, Sean. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=35.6s)]
*  We just wrapped up a fraud case with Letitia James [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=37.04s)]
*  about books and records, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=42.3s)]
*  about statements of financial condition [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=44.32s)]
*  that were undervalued. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  And here we are and they've taken this same issue [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=47.56s)]
*  and tried to stack a civil issue for $130,000 [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=50.84s)]
*  with 34 counts, what would normally be a misdemeanor, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=55.92s)]
*  but excuse me, under brag, 51 plus percent are dismissed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=59.82s)]
*  and don't even get charged. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=63.46s)]
*  And they're making it a federal crime [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  because they're desperate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=66.78s)]
*  So let's not forget what this is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=68.02000000000001s)]
*  It's the same trial I just finished. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=69.94s)]
*  It's the same state I just finished [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  and we got demolished by crooked judges. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  And this is what we're doing again [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=78.12s)]
*  and it's desperate and it's obvious. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=79.92s)]
*  And the rulings today, Sean, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=81.88s)]
*  as I spoke to you earlier on the radio, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  I was infuriated. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=85.12s)]
*  To not allow an expert is a fatal error [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=86.72s)]
*  by the judge in my opinion. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=89.64s)]
*  There's so many avenues for appeal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=92.12s)]
*  The problem with the appeal is there's a conviction [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=93.8s)]
*  that that happens after the election. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=96.76s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=98.56s)]
*  Alina, we really appreciate it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=100.4s)]
*  You've been in the courtroom every day [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=101.88s)]
*  and I can't imagine what that's like in real life. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=103.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=106.0s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVIjSGQrGiE&t=114.72s)]
