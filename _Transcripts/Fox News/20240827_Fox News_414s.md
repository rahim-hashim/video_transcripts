*  highlight his life and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  his actions his heroic actions and those of his his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=44.56s)]

*  That continue to do so and grateful that we have men and women still wanting to join up [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Let me let me get to you congressman because I think this is important [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=82.28s)]
*  The fact that they viewed this as a success and they bragged about it is is alarming in and of itself [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=86.36s)]
*  She is the last person in the room. Okay [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=92.56s)]
*  Donald Trump had a very different foreign policy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=97.0s)]
*  We didn't lose a single American the last 18 months [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=99.68s)]
*  He was president in Afghanistan and he's told us the story why? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  He told us that he called the head of the Taliban and and actually let the head of the Taliban know his exact [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=107.48s)]
*  Position while talking to him and basically implying why do you why do you show me a picture of my house? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=113.96s)]
*  Because I know where you are and I will come for you first basically to me [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=120.04s)]
*  That was the message Donald Trump was sent was sending [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=124.44s)]
*  This is just one small [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=128.88s)]
*  One small position of what are the most radical positions ever and she doesn't want to talk to the American people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=131.48s)]
*  We have a lot of problems going on here and she just wants to duck and hide and dodge and weave and and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  And basically hide in the basement and the media so far is letting her getting away with it letting her get away with it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Well Sean President Trump is a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=153.56s)]
*  Tough guy. He's a commander-in-chief and he knows how to deal with whether it's the terrorist she Putin [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=156.24s)]
*  or the ayatollahs and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=164.12s)]
*  When he tells Abdul the head of the Taliban [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=166.88s)]
*  Excuse me. We're gonna have a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  You know a missile in your house if you don't live up to your end of the bargain [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=175.0s)]
*  Then you don't have any Americans killed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=179.52s)]
*  That's what we need in a commander-in-chief [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=181.72s)]
*  And what we saw today at Arlington was a commander-in-chief who cared a commander-in-chief [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Who was present and stood with these families at their graveside? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=190.16s)]
*  And you know what else he promised them on top of promising? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=194.64s)]
*  Accountability and to fire every official [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  He promised these families [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=202.16s)]
*  Transparency the other thing they haven't gotten from Harris or Biden and when he's back in office [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=204.6s)]
*  He'll release all the tapes all the videos all the emails [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  All of it so that they have the closure and the answers [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=216.32s)]
*  That they need so this is a commander-in-chief [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=220.28s)]
*  We have to have and the thing that was so infuriating today Sean was that everybody's standing there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=223.2s)]
*  Look, I've lost Green Berets in combat [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=230.04s)]
*  You know, we had a cemetery full of people we've lost but everybody's standing there knew this didn't have to happen [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=233.0s)]
*  This was senseless Darren Hoover did not have to lose his son Taylor [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=240.72s)]
*  and that everybody knows you take the military out after [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=245.84s)]
*  You take our civilians and you take our allies out I mean President Trump says it best a five-year-old [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=251.2s)]
*  Would know that so we have to have President Trump back in office as [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=258.4s)]
*  Commander-in-chief that could take care of our families take care of our veterans and deal with the likes of the Taliban [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  She Putin and the rest. I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=270.56s)]
*  Don't think they fear Kamala Harris at all like they haven't feared Biden [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=273.68s)]
*  What what words mr. Hoover do you have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  For the American people we saw what happened when the bodies were returned home and Joe Biden looking at his watch [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  He was looking at his watch, right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=288.88s)]
*  Yes, he was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  every every single time that a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  Casket came off of that plane. He was checking it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=295.76s)]
*  You know to the American people just please understand that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=299.96s)]
*  That [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  What President Trump did today means all that we could have ever asked for in the world [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  He cares he has done from day one [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  When we've sat down with him at both Mar-a-Lago at Bedminster when we've been to Israelis when we were at the RNC [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=315.68s)]
*  The man cares deeply about this country and I wish I wish so bad [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  That the rest of the country could see what we see behind the scenes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=328.88s)]
*  The love the compassion the the honor the integrity behind everything that he does and make no mistake about it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  He's very measured [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  but as far as the the Biden and Harris [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  Administration we still to this day still to this day. We have not heard one thing and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  My main questions is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=354.2s)]
*  How? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=356.84s)]
*  Did this happen how did you allow this to happen? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=358.0s)]
*  I want to know the Intel that they based everything off of to give them to get them to the point [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=361.4s)]
*  where they pulled everything out like they did and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=368.12s)]
*  They let them out all the way up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=371.6s)]
*  they let the march from province to province to province and they didn't stop them and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=374.76s)]
*  And then the next thing they know they're they're pressed them. They're back against the wall [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=379.72s)]
*  They abandoned Americans behind enemy lines and heroes like your son lost his life 13 Americans and and many more [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=384.48s)]
*  Abandoned behind enemy lines. I'm very sorry. Mr. Hoover. Our prayers are with you. Please know that and I know I speak for this audience [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvxYJFEm3BE&t=392.64s)]
