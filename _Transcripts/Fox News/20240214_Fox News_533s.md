# Hannity: Here's my Valentine's Day message to Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0)
*  Last week's damning special counsel report highlighted, remember, Biden's quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=0.0s)]
*  poor memory. And according to a brand new NBC News report, it's worse than we thought. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=4.88s)]
*  Listen to this. During his hastily planned damage control, remember the disastrous press [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  conference at the last minute last Thursday. Remember, Biden attacked the special counsel, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=17.12s)]
*  Robert Herr, for asking about his son, Bo's death. Maybe you remember this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=27.84s)]
*  my recollection of events. There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=31.28s)]
*  How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  it wasn't any of their damn business. Let me tell you something. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=45.44s)]
*  Somebody have commented, I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=50.96s)]
*  our lady of every Memorial Day, we hold a service remembering him attending by friends and family [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=56.08s)]
*  and the people who loved him. Add to that our lady of what? Our lady of what? How in the hell [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=65.2s)]
*  did he dare raise that or dare he raise that? I thought to myself, you know, it wasn't any of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=72.64s)]
*  the damn business. Well, here's the news tonight. If that all wasn't bad enough, that press conference [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=77.52s)]
*  wasn't bad enough. You had, he didn't remember our lady of, he didn't remember that General LCC [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=84.48s)]
*  was the head of Egypt. And according to NBC News's report, Joe's memory failed him once again. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=90.08s)]
*  Now, two sources familiar with the special counsel's interview of President Biden, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=96.48s)]
*  likely the White House, that's my best guess, are now actually saying that it was Joe himself [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=101.04s)]
*  that brought up the topic of Bo Biden's death. It was never Robert Herr. Now, Joe brought the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=107.44s)]
*  topic up after being asked about his workflow from 2016 to 2018. And according to the sources, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=114.32s)]
*  Biden tried to recall what else happened in his life during this time. Remember, he didn't even [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  remember, was it, was I still vice president in 2009? And when he appeared confused about when [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=125.6s)]
*  his son passed away and everything else, allegedly getting the date, you know, right, but the year [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=131.2s)]
*  wrong by more than a few years, what have I been saying? Joe, your president, he is not cognitively [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  strong enough to be one of those nice Walmart greeters. You know, the people that meet you at [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=143.52s)]
*  the door and say, is there anything we can do to help you? Yeah, I'd like the sporting goods [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  department. He could not do that job because he'd never be able to recall where all the departments [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=153.12s)]
*  are. Meanwhile, did the floundering Biden administration suffer yet another intelligence [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=158.24s)]
*  failure? Listen to this news. House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, he is now urging [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=163.68s)]
*  Biden to declassify information related to a quote, serious national security threat. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=169.36s)]
*  And speaking from the White House today, NSA's, well, Jake Sullivan didn't exactly ease anybody's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  concern. Take a look at this. In the simplest of terms, can you tell Americans that there's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  nothing they have to worry about right now in terms of what he describes as a national security [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  threat? Look, I think in a way that question, um, it is impossible to answer with a straight yes, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=190.8s)]
*  right? And now tonight, by the way, sources are telling Fox News that the threat is related to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=198.96s)]
*  Russian nuclear capability in space. Let's see. Hypersonic missiles, uh, check Russia, no check [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=205.12s)]
*  America. Now we have this case with space nukes. Are you kidding me? This new threat comes as your [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=212.72s)]
*  president is now warning House Republicans if they don't pass the ludicrous foreign aid bill, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  the one that in fact will be against Russia and Putin that they're siding with Putin. That is not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=226.24s)]
*  what they've said. They said secure our border first. His comments are being echoed by some on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  the right, including Utah Senator Mitt Romney. It is disgusting. Joe Biden said Trump was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  unpatriotic. No, he's not nor any other Republicans. This bill includes yet another $60 billion for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=243.52s)]
*  Ukraine on top of the 75 billion we've already given them at a time. We have, you know, what, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=251.92s)]
*  34 trillion in debt, 2 trillion more last year thanks to Biden. And earlier today, House minority [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  leader Hakeem Jeffries may have said the quiet part out loud, releasing a statement that literally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=263.44s)]
*  reads quote, the most urgent national security threat facing the American people right now is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=269.12s)]
*  the possibility that Congress abandoned Ukraine and allows Vladimir Putin's Russia to win. Uh, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=274.56s)]
*  now, of course, the Democrats, they are completely ignoring the greatest real national security [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=281.04s)]
*  threat that is facing our country right now every day and has been since Joe became president. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  That is the border crisis of his own making. He created it since Joe Biden took office. We now have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  nearly 10 million unvetted Joe Biden, illegal immigrants that have crossed our southern border, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=298.24s)]
*  many of which they're roaming free around the country. You know, they're coming from, let's see, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Russia, China and elsewhere. Gee, do you think they're coming [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=308.24s)]
*  with their families for a better life? Or maybe some of them have nefarious intentions for the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=314.08s)]
*  country. But as per usual, Biden and the left, they're putting the blame on the, on the, on the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  Republicans claiming that they need Congress to fix Joe's problem. Excuse me. That is a flat out [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=325.2s)]
*  lie. Joe Biden undid all of these successful Trump policies that made our border secure in the first [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=332.4s)]
*  place. He inherited the most secure border in modern history, but with the stroke of a pen, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  he got rid of them. And with the stroke of a pen, he can put them back in place. It's that easy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=345.28s)]
*  But that did not stop the White House from tweeting this kind of bizarre Valentine to house speaker, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=349.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson. Uh, happy Valentine's day, by the way, everybody. Roses are red, violets are blue. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  The border deal was crushed because of you. Uh, that is a real tweet sent out by the official [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=360.32s)]
*  White House government account. Okay. Let's play along in keeping with the spirit of the Valentine's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=366.32s)]
*  day. I can't send Joe flowers. They wouldn't accept them from me. I can't send them candy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=371.76s)]
*  And he's not my Valentine. Okay. How about roses are red, violets are blue. People from Iran, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=376.24s)]
*  Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, China and Russia are all here because of you, Joe. Or how about this one? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=381.76s)]
*  Roses are red, violets are blue. Any American killed by an illegal immigrant will be because [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=388.48s)]
*  of you, Joe, and the blood will be on your hands. And thankfully in less than nine months, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=393.68s)]
*  you, the American people have a chance to put an end to this national nightmare and defeat Joe Biden [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=399.44s)]
*  in November. But in order to do so, Republicans, you better learn some lessons from last night's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=405.44s)]
*  defeat in the New York congressional special election. My former district, when I once lived [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=410.48s)]
*  in New York for starters, they were outspent dramatically. Uh, some people have told me it [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=414.72s)]
*  could be as high as eight to one that cannot happen. Republicans need to even the playing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=419.6s)]
*  field financially. Secondly, more importantly, Republicans have to learn from the Democrats [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  that early voting efforts, uh, were critical in this election yesterday and on election day. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=429.6s)]
*  Guess what? It was a major storm in district three in New York that hammered the entire area, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=435.68s)]
*  crippling turnout, especially for older voters who are prone to voting on election day. That [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=441.52s)]
*  means conservatives Republicans need to embrace early voting and voting by mail and they better [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=446.88s)]
*  at least match, hopefully surpass the legal ballots, harvesting efforts of Democrats where [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=452.08s)]
*  it's allowed. The New York times even admitted the snow storm was a boost, a major boost to Swazi [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  because Democrats tend to vote early and absentee. They had stockpiled the lead of thousands of votes [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=463.2s)]
*  before the snow ever started falling. Republicans, they need to find ways to counter, you know, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=468.64s)]
*  the early ground game. You cannot go into election day in a tight race down by thousands of votes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=474.88s)]
*  They need to embrace early voting, voting by mail. No, it's not the system I've wanted. I've said [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=480.0s)]
*  it a thousand times. We're stuck with this system until Republicans win elections. Then they can [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=484.88s)]
*  change it. With all that said, there is good news for Republicans in New York, the New York Times [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=490.96s)]
*  focus group of 13 independent voters. Yeah, in New York, 11 said they're voting for Trump over Biden. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=496.64s)]
*  At least their eyes are open and two brand new swing state polls were released by Fox tonight. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=502.64s)]
*  One showing Trump leading Biden by two points. That's in Michigan. Another showing him with a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=507.68s)]
*  five point lead in North Carolina, a must win state for Donald Trump. Both states critical [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=512.4s)]
*  to his path to take back the White House in November. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=518.72s)]
*  Our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJT736iKH0&t=526.64s)]
