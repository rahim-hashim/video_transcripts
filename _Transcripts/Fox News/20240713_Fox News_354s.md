# Eyewitness: The crowd 'went nuts' when Trump pumped his fist
**Fox News:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw)
*  We turn now to our next guest, who were four rows behind Donald Trump during tonight's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=0.0s)]
*  shooting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=6.24s)]
*  Robert Rosano and Thomas Lepore, thank you both for being with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=7.24s)]
*  Robert, let's start with you and get your take. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=14.44s)]
*  Four rows behind. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=17.76s)]
*  What did you see? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=18.8s)]
*  Sean, you know, it was just a really surreal moment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=19.8s)]
*  You know, just 10, 15 minutes prior, we're sitting there, we're watching former President [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=26.200000000000003s)]
*  Trump, you know, give a great speech. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=32.0s)]
*  The crowd was electric despite, you know, the heat, the weather. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, we saw him come out to God bless America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And it was just a great moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=42.92s)]
*  The crowd was just really happy to hear him and see him and be there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=45.56s)]
*  And, you know, then all of a sudden mayhem, you know, ensued. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=51.96s)]
*  And we heard probably three to four shots ring out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=58.08s)]
*  And you know, most of the crowd, it hit the ground after that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=64.16s)]
*  We heard several more shots ring out that sounded a lot more powerful. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=69.28s)]
*  We assumed that it was, you know, Secret Service because they were a lot closer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=76.12s)]
*  And then, you know, we looked up and you could see in the stands that there were several [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=81.12s)]
*  bodies, unfortunately, that were on the ground. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=88.56s)]
*  There was a good deal of blood. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  And it looked like law enforcement was carrying a body out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  You know, we weren't sure, you know, who it might have been. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  But the next thing that I knew, Sean, was we looked up and we saw the president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=101.84s)]
*  He stood proud. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=106.84s)]
*  Secret Service had helped him up and he pumped his fist at the crowd. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=109.12s)]
*  And, you know, the crowd went nuts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=112.12s)]
*  You know, we started chanting USA and, you know, there was a sense of relief, I think, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  that overcame us because we were just happy that, you know, President Trump was OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=125.28s)]
*  And let me get the take of Thomas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=126.6s)]
*  Thomas, tell us what you saw and if it was any different. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=131.52s)]
*  And I do appreciate both of you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=135.92s)]
*  I guess you were both in row four, Thomas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=138.12s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=140.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=142.32s)]
*  Before I get started, obviously, my thoughts and prayers go out to the Trump family and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=144.16s)]
*  the innocent bystanders who got hit today as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=149.84s)]
*  It's very disturbing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=154.92s)]
*  We're only, you know, four roads back from President Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=156.96s)]
*  The crowd was awesome. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=162.4s)]
*  You know, it was 90 degrees all day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=163.48s)]
*  We stood outside for, you know, six, seven, eight hours waiting to see him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=165.28s)]
*  And it's when he comes out, it's unmatched. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=170.12s)]
*  It's there's no one like him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=173.68s)]
*  It's electric. We love it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=176.52s)]
*  And it's just it's very disappointing what happened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=178.72s)]
*  You know, we have a group text that we talk about, you know, a lot of political things. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=181.6s)]
*  And we we had this, you know, and we had this in our back of our mind. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=187.04s)]
*  Like, this is our last attempt to take him out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=191.24s)]
*  And it happened, you know, five rows in front of us, which is very shocking and disturbing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=194.32s)]
*  I'm just glad he's OK. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=201.52s)]
*  But again, I'm just I'm very hurt that innocent bystanders had to, you know, they're not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=202.68s)]
*  welcoming him to their families tonight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=210.6s)]
*  It's it's disturbing and it shouldn't happen in this country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=211.96s)]
*  Let me ask you, when this happened and you saw the injured people in front of you and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  you saw what had happened to the to the president, you know, what was the reaction of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=219.88s)]
*  other people in the crowd? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Robert, I'll ask you first. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=226.76s)]
*  You know what, Sean? I think that for the most part, people were stunned. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=229.84s)]
*  There was just, I think, a sense of shock that came over everyone. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=236.0s)]
*  You know, I know for for, you know, my personal sense was, you know, we're in a fishbowl, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=240.16s)]
*  you know, and you start to hear gunshots and you don't know where they're coming from. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=246.2s)]
*  And, you know, you're thinking about yourself at that point. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=251.28s)]
*  Obviously, you know, you're thinking about the president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=255.12s)]
*  But, you know, I have two small children, you know, and that was the first thing that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=256.96s)]
*  came to my mind was, you know, I just want to make it out here to see my kids. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=261.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it kind of comes down to that, Thomas. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=266.88s)]
*  It's in the end, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=269.8s)]
*  You go to a political rally. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  The last thing you expect is what happened tonight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's just concerning that there was, you know, there was a security breach to me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=277.12s)]
*  I don't understand how that happens in this day and age. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=283.48s)]
*  But again, this is, you know, the climate we're in right now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=286.16s)]
*  We need to do better as a country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=290.24s)]
*  We need to, you know, not be as divided as we are. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  And we need to understand that there are different sides. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  That's awesome. That's great. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=301.23999999999995s)]
*  People have their own opinion, their own voice. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=303.32s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you know, we're all human. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=306.0s)]
*  We all have family members. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  We're all loved by others. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=310.76s)]
*  And this type of violence is just not accepted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=312.08s)]
*  It shouldn't be accepted in this country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=315.2s)]
*  And I hope going forward, it's not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  And to me, not like, again, with what happened with Trump falling down again, up and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=320.32s)]
*  pumping his fist, he's immortal to me now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=326.48s)]
*  I will support him to the end and I will fight for him to the end. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=329.12s)]
*  But violence like this is unacceptable. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=335.76s)]
*  And I just thank God that more people weren't injured. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=338.8s)]
*  And but again, you know, one is too many in the situation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, kind of amazing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  You guys go to a rally and I'm sure the last thing both of you, Robert and Thomas, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=348.2s)]
*  expect tonight, but we do appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8I6KtSgkPw&t=352.04s)]
