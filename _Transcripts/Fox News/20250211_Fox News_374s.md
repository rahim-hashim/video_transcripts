# 'This is not a game': Tom Homan warns against leaks on ICE raids
**Fox News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk)
*  And tonight, a very disturbing trend is taking hold as President Trump is implementing his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=0.0s)]
*  mass deportation policy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=5.16s)]
*  Looks like every time ICE is preparing to launch a large-scale enforcement operation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=7.44s)]
*  in a liberal city, information about that raid is leaked. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=11.88s)]
*  And now the administration is taking major steps to make sure that stops happening. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=15.74s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi warning yesterday, right here on Fox News, quote, if you leaked [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=20.72s)]
*  it, we will find out who you are. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=25.84s)]
*  We will come after you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=27.82s)]
*  Just after Homeland Security, Secretary Kristi Noem said that she thought that FBI employees [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=29.64s)]
*  were the ones responsible for these leaks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=34.92s)]
*  Also tonight, our own Bill Mollusian reporting that Secretary Noem is asking the Treasury [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=37.84s)]
*  Department to allow IRS agents to be sent to the southern border to help enforce immigration [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  law. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=48.64s)]
*  Here with more is Trump administration, Bordesart, Tom Homan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=49.64s)]
*  Tom, where are these leaks coming from? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, we think it's coming from inside. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=56.08s)]
*  And we know the first leak of Aurora is under current investigation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  We think we identified that person under investigation right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  The California leak, Secretary Noem, you know, she's correct. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=68.24s)]
*  Some of the information we're receiving tends to lead toward the FBI. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=74.0s)]
*  But I talked to Deputy Attorney General all this weekend. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=78.44s)]
*  They've opened up a criminal investigation, and they have promised that not only this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=82.4s)]
*  person will lose their job and lose their pension, they're going to go to jail. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=86.72s)]
*  They're going to criminally prosecute. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=90.48s)]
*  So we're all over it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=91.6s)]
*  We've got the DHS IG investigating the first one. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=92.92s)]
*  I have a pretty good idea of what happened. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=95.92s)]
*  Can't share a lot because it's under investigation, but the IG has opened up a criminal investigation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  The second one, we're sending a strong message. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=102.44s)]
*  It's just not, you know, giving the bad guys a heads up so they can escape apprehension, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=104.52s)]
*  arresting, you know, given, you know, Venezuela gang heads up so we can't arrest them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=108.84s)]
*  You're putting officers' lives at risk. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=114.08s)]
*  It's only a matter of time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=115.88s)]
*  We walk into a place where there's going to be a bad guy who doesn't care. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=116.92s)]
*  He's going to be sitting and wait for the officers to show up and ambush him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=119.76s)]
*  This is not a game. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=123.24s)]
*  So DHS and DOJ are connected at hip to hold these people responsible in a criminal fashion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=124.32s)]
*  So early indications are this is coming from our own FBI. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=131.36s)]
*  How certain are you of that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=135.24s)]
*  Information leading to that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=139.16000000000003s)]
*  Again, I'll let the Department of Justice do their own investigation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  But again, I talked to the deputy attorney general this week and they've opened up a criminal investigation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=145.72000000000003s)]
*  He thinks the information is coming from there also. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=151.0s)]
*  So we'll let that investigation play out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=153.68s)]
*  But some of the leads point that way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=156.0s)]
*  Wow, that's really scary. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  The idea of, you know, not hiring these 88,000 IRS agents to go after, you know, law-abiding [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  taxpayers and bringing them to the border, how helpful would that be in your mission? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=169.84s)]
*  We'll put them to work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=177.44s)]
*  For the law enforcement officers, we're certainly putting work in helping secure some of these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  at-large operations. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=183.52s)]
*  They don't have immigration authority, but they can certainly cover a back door. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=184.52s)]
*  They can certainly transport. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=187.56s)]
*  They can certainly help process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=188.56s)]
*  The non-criminal IRS agent, they can help us process and do some intelligence and wrap [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=190.32s)]
*  around infrastructure planning. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=196.16s)]
*  We'll take them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=197.56s)]
*  We can use all the help we can get, because this is a big operation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=198.56s)]
*  So I hope we get some of them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=201.4s)]
*  I think it's—President Trump's made it very clear this is all a government approach, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=202.96s)]
*  because this is a national security vulnerability, our open border. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=207.72s)]
*  And having all these over two-man known gotaways—you and I have talked about this a lot, Sean—helping [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=212.4s)]
*  us find these people who paid more to get away over two-man. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't know who they are, where they came from, why they're here, but we need to find [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=220.28s)]
*  those folks, and we'll take every man and woman available to come. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=223.44s)]
*  You know, I keep going back to a question, and you have every right to be irritated with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=227.56s)]
*  me for keep asking it, is—and this is the scary part of tipping off the enemy, because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=232.96s)]
*  you're right, they'll lie in wait, and the element of surprise will be removed from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  those brave agents that are willing to find—but we—the people in this country that don't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=244.76s)]
*  belong here, but among them are known murderers and rapists and terrorists and cartel members [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=250.32s)]
*  and gang members. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=257.04s)]
*  This is not an easy lift to begin with. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=258.4s)]
*  And you've expressed confidence that you'll find them all, and the question is how quickly [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=262.88s)]
*  do you think we can find them all? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=267.12s)]
*  Well, sanctuary cities, you know, they're putting up every roadblock possible, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=268.6s)]
*  rather than arresting the bad guy in a county jail, takes one agent to arrest a bad guy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=274.28s)]
*  when he gets arrested and put in a county jail. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=278.0s)]
*  We've got to send the whole team to the neighborhood. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=280.52s)]
*  So it's going to be—it's very difficult in sanctuary cities, but we're going to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=282.12s)]
*  keep coming. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=285.2s)]
*  What are we doing about sanctuary cities? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=286.2s)]
*  I'm going to double the manpower in those sanctuary cities. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=287.2s)]
*  Sanctuary cities, if we can't get them in their homes, we'll get them in their place [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=290.4s)]
*  of employment. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=292.44s)]
*  We're going to have large-scale worksite enforcement operation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=293.44s)]
*  So we're going to send more resources. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=297.0s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=298.48s)]
*  We're going to keep coming. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=299.8s)]
*  We're going to keep coming with more. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=300.8s)]
*  We're going to increase the targeting in those cities. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=302.64s)]
*  We're going to give full steam ahead on sanctuary cities. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=304.92s)]
*  Sanctuary cities have become the priority. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=308.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=310.08s)]
*  Because of protection. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=311.08s)]
*  They're protecting public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=312.08s)]
*  So we're going to double the manpower. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=314.88s)]
*  We're going to double operations. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=316.44s)]
*  We're going to double targeting. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=317.76s)]
*  We're coming full bore, and they're not going to stop us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=319.24s)]
*  I'm taking this seriously. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=322.0s)]
*  I don't sleep well at night, because I'm afraid of the people that are walking the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=323.0s)]
*  streets here every day because sanctuary cities are protecting them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are sanctuary for criminals. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=330.4s)]
*  Bottom line. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=332.32s)]
*  So we're going to do everything we can to find them, regardless of what it takes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=333.32s)]
*  We got a strong president in the White House that's giving us all the authority we need. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  We're coming. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  I've been saying it for years, they are aiding and abetting and the law breaking. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  And frankly, all of them that protect these criminals and those criminals that go on to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  commit violent crime, murder, rape against Americans, they have blood on their hands. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=356.44s)]
*  Tom Homan, we will continue to update our audience on this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=358.28s)]
*  It's too important what you're doing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=361.24s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=362.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=880ClWgfgOk&t=363.52s)]
