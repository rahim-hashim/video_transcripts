# Democratic senators are wandering around like the ‘Walking Dead’: Sen. Ted Cruz
**Fox News:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw)
*  Here with more, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, first, I don't think—we've had you on once, I guess, since your election. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=2.16s)]
*  Congratulations again to you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=6.16s)]
*  We need you back in the Senate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=8.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can explain it any better in terms of what really happened or the deep [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=9.8s)]
*  level of denial of the left, because that's what they want. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=15.48s)]
*  That was their vision for America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=19.46s)]
*  And I can't even believe we had to fight this radical extremism. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=21.72s)]
*  But thankfully, in the end, the American people got it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, Sean, the left is melting down and they're still in shock over the results of the election. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=29.8s)]
*  I'm here in the Senate right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=35.24s)]
*  I got to tell you, the Democrat senators are walking around. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=37.08s)]
*  It's like the walking dead. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=40.08s)]
*  They're zombies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=41.36s)]
*  They don't understand what happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=42.36s)]
*  They're turning on each other. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=44.32s)]
*  The Biden White House, it's something else to see Biden's team blaming Kamala, Kamala's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  team blaming Biden. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And they're all mad at the American people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=52.32s)]
*  What they're not doing is actually engaged in introspection and saying, wait, how did [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=54.56s)]
*  we embrace such nutty policies? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  How did we open up the border and let the country be invaded? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=62.36s)]
*  How did we release murderers and rapists and child molesters? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=65.28s)]
*  How did we not figure out the difference between boys and girls and men and women? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=68.28s)]
*  The extremism on the left, what is sad to see is they're not engaging in a correction. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=74.88s)]
*  Instead, they're doubling down and they're mad at the voters. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=82.64s)]
*  But I got to say, Election Day, it was breathtaking. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=85.36s)]
*  You look at Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump won the popular vote nationally by millions of votes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  That hadn't happened in 20 years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=93.6s)]
*  You look at Trump, all seven battlegrounds, he won all seven across the board. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  It was stunning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=101.08s)]
*  We won the House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=102.08s)]
*  We won the Senate. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=103.08s)]
*  You look at the numbers, my race in Texas, I won by nine points. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=104.08s)]
*  I won by a million votes across the state. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  What I'm probably most excited about is that I won Hispanics statewide by six points. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=111.56s)]
*  In South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley has been a blue bastion for a hundred years and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=118.04s)]
*  the valley turned red. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=124.4s)]
*  Donald Trump won Hispanics. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=126.44s)]
*  I won Hispanics. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=127.88s)]
*  That is a generational change. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=129.44s)]
*  It's because people are getting back to common sense ideas that make sense and that work. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=132.08s)]
*  Maybe it's as simple as people believe in the rule of law. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=138.08s)]
*  They don't want unvetted, Harris-Biden, illegal immigrants. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=141.16s)]
*  They get special treatment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=146.56s)]
*  You know, we'll decriminalize illegal immigration, free food, housing, healthcare, education, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  legal driver's licenses, taxpayer-funded sex change operations, taxpayer-funded college. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=153.16s)]
*  I mean, where is all this money going to come from? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  The question is, you know, do you think America is really ready for something that we as conservatives [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=162.76s)]
*  have wanted for a long time, and that is to return to constitutional order? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=169.76s)]
*  That means real reform of government. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=174.88s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are talking about a $2 trillion cut to the federal bureaucracy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=177.12s)]
*  They're talking about, you know, eliminating, you know, government agencies like the Education [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=184.2s)]
*  Department. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=189.6s)]
*  In other words, send it back to the states. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=190.6s)]
*  They know better how to raise their kids and educate their kids. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=191.66s)]
*  Do you think the country is ready? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=195.56s)]
*  Do you think the country is ready for mass deportation? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=197.56s)]
*  Look, I think we have a mandate coming out of this election to change the path we're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=200.28s)]
*  on, to secure the border front and center. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=205.8s)]
*  That is a massive priority to get the economy moving, to bring back jobs, to bring inflation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=208.2s)]
*  under control, to stop the war on energy, to lower energy costs, to become energy dominant, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=213.12s)]
*  and also to end the wars abroad, to stop sending billions of dollars to our enemies, to stand [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=219.68s)]
*  with our friends. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=224.6s)]
*  I think that is a mandate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=225.64s)]
*  I think it is powerful. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=227.64s)]
*  And, you know, we were talking a second ago about South Texas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=228.64s)]
*  You look at a county like Star County, the most Hispanic county in America, 97% Hispanic. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=231.92s)]
*  We've seen Star County have a 70-point swing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=240.56s)]
*  It shifted Republican this election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=244.84s)]
*  I was down campaigning in Star County just a couple of weeks before the election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  It is powerful. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=251.0s)]
*  And just yesterday, I was down in the valley. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  I was there with President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=255.16s)]
*  We were there for the SpaceX launch, which was incredible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=257.4s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Sean, as we drove in the motorcade from the plane to the launch, people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=262.92s)]
*  were lined on the streets waving signs for Trump cheering. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=267.92s)]
*  By the way, Sean, you'll be pleased to know as we flew back out of Texas, we're on Trump [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=273.08s)]
*  Force One, and on the TV, we're watching your show. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=277.88s)]
*  We're watching the monologue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=281.24s)]
*  And I'll tell you, President Trump and I and everyone on the plane, we were cheering [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=282.8s)]
*  for your monologue last night. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  But it is where the American people are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=288.8s)]
*  They're ready to get back to common sense. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=290.64s)]
*  They're ready to change the insanity that we've seen for the last four years. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=293.0s)]
*  You know, this—all these so-called rhino conservatives, they claim to be conservative, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=297.92s)]
*  they're not. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=303.76s)]
*  They're Republican in name only. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=304.76s)]
*  You know, they've always said for years that they want limited government, greater freedom. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=305.76s)]
*  You know, we want to end waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=310.36s)]
*  Now is their opportunity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=312.68s)]
*  This is their moment of truth. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  And I really believe for the first time in my adult life we have that opportunity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=315.4s)]
*  Senator, you have been in the forefront of making this country aware of the danger at [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=319.2s)]
*  our borders, you and Governor Abbott. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=324.4s)]
*  I thank you both. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=326.0s)]
*  Congratulations on your victory. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=327.0s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGg2VvARfVw&t=328.8s)]
