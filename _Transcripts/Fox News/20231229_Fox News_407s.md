# Newt Gingrich: We have a totalitarian left
**Fox News:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI)
*  Now, one Democratic congressman who actually voted to impeach Donald Trump also blasted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=0.0s)]
*  Bellows, writing, quote, We are a nation of laws. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Therefore, until Trump is actually found guilty of the crime of insurrection—which is not [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=8.08s)]
*  going to happen—he should be allowed on the ballot. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this creates a dangerous new president that will come back to haunt [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=15.92s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=19.86s)]
*  But we do hope Sheena Bellows enjoys her 15 minutes of fame. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=21.28s)]
*  I don't know if I hope she does. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=24.92s)]
*  But here now with more. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=27.08s)]
*  Fox News contributor, former House speaker, speaker of the House, of course, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=28.8s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, thank you so much for being with me tonight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, your experience speaks for itself, and your insight about the nature of all the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=37.4s)]
*  things that we've seen in this country is invaluable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  But this has really—with all the things we would have expected of the left and of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=46.96s)]
*  the Democrats, this really does jump the shark, if you will. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=51.28s)]
*  Tell me your thoughts on what we've been experiencing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=55.96s)]
*  Well, I think we need to refocus on what's happening. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  There's too much talk about the war against Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=64.2s)]
*  This is not a war against Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=67.88s)]
*  This is a war against the American people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=69.88s)]
*  You see that with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's talked about the fact that the left wants [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=72.68s)]
*  an oligarchy to run everything, and they won't allow him to compete. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=78.16s)]
*  You see it if you talk to the people at no labels, who've been working very hard to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=82.36s)]
*  obey the rules and may well be on all 50 ballots. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  And in every state, they've had Democrats try to keep them off the ballot. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=90.08s)]
*  And think about it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=94.28s)]
*  The attack in Colorado is not on Donald Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=95.28s)]
*  The attack's on the 1,300,000 Coloradans who voted for him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=97.88s)]
*  The attack in Maine is not on Donald Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  He carried the Northern District of Maine. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=105.24s)]
*  So this is an attack on every person in the Northern District of Maine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=108.32s)]
*  And I think we need to be very clear. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=112.32s)]
*  You know, if you're Jewish, you probably shouldn't be too open about it at Harvard [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=114.08s)]
*  or Columbia, because you'll get punished. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=118.08s)]
*  If you actually believe that there are only two sexes, you probably shouldn't say it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=120.88s)]
*  too openly, because you'll get punished. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=124.35999999999999s)]
*  And go down the list. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=126.35999999999999s)]
*  You have a totalitarian left, and the assault on the American people, they cannot survive [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=128.04s)]
*  If you have a free and fair election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=134.88s)]
*  And so they're devoting huge amounts of money. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=137.04s)]
*  I mean, if we had a news media worthy of the effort, they would be out right now finding [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  out from Soros to every other left-wing group how much money is being poured into trying [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=144.16s)]
*  to radically change this country, and the numbers would be staggering. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=151.24s)]
*  And all of it isn't an attack on Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=155.46s)]
*  It's an attack on the American people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Money happens to be the vehicle for their desire for real change. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=161.2s)]
*  But what they're terrified of is not just Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=165.72s)]
*  It's the underlying nature of the American people and their desire for a patriotic country [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=168.32s)]
*  based on solid values. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  An excellent point, because obviously if you can't vote for the person that you like, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  that is the strike at the individual engaged in this process, separate from Donald Trump, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=181.88s)]
*  But it is about what we understand our system to be, about this republic we have and about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  us being the boss and making these choices. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, we know a left—we speak about funding. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  We know a left-wing group funded the lawsuit. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  It was a case that got to the Colorado Supreme Court. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  And of course, Maine, there was no case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=206.12s)]
*  This was just a declaration. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=208.4s)]
*  And there are more states considering doing this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=210.8s)]
*  This also happened when we still had three Democrats on that Colorado Supreme Court [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=213.14s)]
*  dissent. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, that makes me feel that there is some hope, that there are Democrats who are also [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  seeing this as a problem. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=224.05999999999997s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=226.42s)]
*  Because this clearly seems to be organized by something larger than each state alone. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, it's clear. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=234.1s)]
*  There's a nationwide left-wing movement of radicals who want open borders. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=238.74s)]
*  They want to abolish teaching American history. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=244.22s)]
*  They want to impose on second-, third-, and fourth-graders a series of sexual choices [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  that most people think is irrational. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Just go down the list. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=256.9s)]
*  And these people are all connected to each other. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  They're all funded by people like Soros. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=260.74s)]
*  They're all funded by the Ford Foundation and a whole range of other—the elites, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=263.14s)]
*  collectively, want to somehow radically change America and subordinate it to a larger global [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  system. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  And they're doing everything they can. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=275.02000000000004s)]
*  The New York Times is sort of their primary cheerleader. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=277.06s)]
*  The Washington Post is a secondary cheerleader. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=279.82s)]
*  But these folks all are determined to destroy the America that you and I grew up in and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=282.3s)]
*  replace it with a remarkably different country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=287.66s)]
*  And part of what's happening is—and Trump happens to be the person who polarizes it—but [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=290.8s)]
*  But what's happening is huge numbers of Americans are saying, enough. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=295.18s)]
*  And the result is, I think, that the Democrats are now in increasing trouble because they're [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  so clearly the party of outrageous anti-American behavior. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=305.38s)]
*  You know, this is what's striking, though, as well, is I guess it's just that they've [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=309.22s)]
*  continually underestimated the American people or really have a contempt for the nature of—maybe [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=313.86s)]
*  not in L.A. and New York, but in that great middle space of a nation that has saved the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  world many times over. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  The people who live in anonymity, work hard, you know, farm, create things, run production, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=329.94s)]
*  and are quiet about it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=338.5s)]
*  It seems—and this is heartening as well—that those individuals are constantly underestimated [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  and spat upon by the cosmopolitan elite in this country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=346.6s)]
*  Well, you have two great examples. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=350.56s)]
*  And I'm trying to remember the word. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=353.56s)]
*  You'll remember it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=355.44s)]
*  The Hillary's term for all the rest of us— Irredeemable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=356.44s)]
*  —who are too conservative to understand. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=359.44s)]
*  Irredeemable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're irredeemable. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=362.0s)]
*  And then remember, remember Barack Obama had a fundraiser in San Francisco talking about [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=363.0s)]
*  small towns in Pennsylvania where people cling to their guns and their Bible. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=372.68s)]
*  The level of contempt for everyday Americans was astonishing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=373.68s)]
*  And by the way, that has further polarized the country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=377.72s)]
*  And I think you're going to see the left become a smaller and smaller part of the American [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=381.36s)]
*  scene. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=386.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=387.76s)]
*  Well, that is perhaps one of the silver linings here. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=388.76s)]
*  This is going to—this had to happen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=389.76s)]
*  And I'm lucky that you're here with us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  And thank you very much for your insights, sir. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igAlYo7_0dI&t=393.4s)]
