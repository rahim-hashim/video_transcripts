# Sean Hannity: Democrats are in a massive hole
**Fox News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw)
*  Two Democratic lawmakers posting the same exact video with the same exact weird script, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=0.0s)]
*  the same forced curse words, holding a microphone the exact same way, and it gets worse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=5.86s)]
*  When Democrats aren't posting cringeworthy videos, many turn into agents of chaos with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=11.74s)]
*  public stunts, performative outrage. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=17.84s)]
*  Today, Congressman Al Green was officially censored for his disgraceful conduct during [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=20.34s)]
*  the president's joint address to Congress. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Green's behavior was also shameful and bizarre that 10 Democrats actually broke party ranks [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=28.06s)]
*  to censor their colleague. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=33.5s)]
*  Now, that's a big deal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=36.18s)]
*  But that didn't stop Green or the Democrats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=38.34s)]
*  They started singing, We Shall Overcome, on the House floor today following the vote. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=40.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  —Representative Al Green be censored with public reading of this resolution by the speaker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  —The House had come to order. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=58.02s)]
*  The House had come to order. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=71.26s)]
*  —Well, the Congressional Tabernacle Chorus. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Green wasn't the only disrupted Democrat during Donald Trump's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=76.06s)]
*  state, well, his joint address before Congress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=80.78s)]
*  There were pointless walkouts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  There were weird paddles with different messages, handwritten signs, plenty of outbursts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=86.26s)]
*  I love the bingo paddles. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=91.26s)]
*  Anyway, never mind that they wouldn't stand for the president or the first lady. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  They couldn't even bring themselves to stand for a brave kid with cancer, the families [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=96.54s)]
*  of murder victims or a future West Point cadet or the young wife of a police officer that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=101.12s)]
*  was murdered. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=107.56s)]
*  This was a reprehensible display of indignation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=108.9s)]
*  Well, the only Democrat I saw that even tried to condemn it was John Fetterman, Senator [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=112.26s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, one of the only Democrats now criticizing his party's behavior. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=116.62s)]
*  On X, he called it out, said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=121.7s)]
*  It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=127.22s)]
*  We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=132.38s)]
*  And right on cue, another car alarm. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=137.9s)]
*  And this time, from our favorite Congresswoman, Jasmine Crockett, who is now accusing Republicans [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=140.82000000000002s)]
*  of racism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=145.46s)]
*  I worked so well during the campaign. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=146.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=148.94s)]
*  As they have decided to go after immigrants and these and things like that, and they've [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=149.94s)]
*  said, oh, they're taking your black jobs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=154.86s)]
*  They're taking your black jobs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=157.58s)]
*  Not really. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  They are obviously jobs that they want us to go back to, such as working the fields. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  All right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=166.06s)]
*  For those immigrants to come into our country, they work the fields, something that we ain't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=167.82s)]
*  done in a long time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=171.1s)]
*  And clearly, he is trying to make us go back to the fields. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=172.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are watching too much MSDNC. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  That's never a good idea. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=182.26s)]
*  The network is filled to the brim with conspiracy theorists who peddle nothing but lie after [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=183.34s)]
*  lie after lie about Donald Trump and the Russia hoax and so much more, and feature a nonstop, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=188.06s)]
*  never-ending loop of Trump hate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=194.02s)]
*  Recently, two of the very worst hosts at the network, Rachel Maddow, the chief conspiracy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=197.18s)]
*  theorist, and Nicole Wallace—what a sad decline she has had—politicized, chided [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  the 13-year-old cancer survivor that Donald Trump honored during his joint address. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=207.9s)]
*  His father has now responded. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=213.62s)]
*  I hope you people over at MSDNC pay attention. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=215.78s)]
*  Rachel Maddow needs to shut her mouth if she has nothing nice to say. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  She does not need to put her bad energy on us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=225.9s)]
*  Why attack a 13-year-old kid? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't Democrats stand for that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  Why wouldn't they celebrate that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  Why wouldn't they stand for mothers that lost their children? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  What does that say about this party today and their friends in the state-run legacy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=241.12s)]
*  media mob that I have declared officially dead? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=245.38000000000002s)]
*  They have no impact on the American public as it played out on November 5th. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=248.74s)]
*  Without a doubt today, even President Trump responded to this sick, disgusting display. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=254.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=258.58s)]
*  Frankly, what Nicole Wallace said, I've never been a fan of hers, and she's not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=259.58s)]
*  very talented. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=267.26s)]
*  But I'll tell you what she said the other day about that young man is disgraceful. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=268.7s)]
*  She should be forced to resign. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=273.12s)]
*  And Rachel Maddow should be forced to resign. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=276.18s)]
*  Nobody watches her anyway. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=278.26s)]
*  I don't know if it's not possible they pay her as much money as I hear, but certainly [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=279.26s)]
*  she's lost all credibility, both of them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=283.82s)]
*  But what they said the other day, they should be forced to resign about that young person [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=286.86s)]
*  who is suffering greatly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, if they fired Joy Reid, why are these two people still there? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=294.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=300.5s)]
*  Rachel Maddow suggested racism may be involved. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=301.5s)]
*  Maybe that's something that NBC needs to look into. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=304.62s)]
*  The media mob, state-run as it is, and the Democratic Party, they have reached a new [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=308.48s)]
*  low. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=312.54s)]
*  They're in a massive hole, but they can't stop digging. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  The narcissism, the rage, has completely taken over. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  And the American people, they have taken notice. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=319.82s)]
*  In fact, a brand new internal poll shared with Politico shows the vast majority of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  voters think the Democratic Party has lost its way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=326.86s)]
*  Well, who thinks they're on the right track? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=329.82000000000005s)]
*  Just 10 percent think the party has a good strategy for the future. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=336.3s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53_wj3eUCiw&t=343.54s)]
