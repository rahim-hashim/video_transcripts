# Sen. John Kennedy reacts to Kamala Harris' interview: 'It was like a wolf promising to be a vegan'
**Fox News:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig)
*  One of her favorites, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. Senator, thanks so much for joining [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=0.0s)]
*  us on Hannity. Are you buying it? The people of Louisiana, pretty important energy state. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=4.8s)]
*  The people of Louisiana buying what she's selling? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=10.16s)]
*  Well, Jason, I listened to the vice president's interview. I'm biased, I suppose, because I know [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=15.52s)]
*  her well. She's a nice person. I just don't agree with her. I had two reactions to her interview. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=24.0s)]
*  Unsurprised, unimpressed. I'm a pretty simple guy. I like breakfast, food and straight answers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=32.56s)]
*  I didn't hear any straight answers from the vice president. What I heard her say basically was, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  I do too have values. And if you don't like them, I have others. I thought she engaged in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=51.04s)]
*  tier one level pandering. It was sort of like a wolf promising to be a vegan if the sheep will [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=60.0s)]
*  just vote for it. Now, look in politics as in life, and you know this, Jason, talk is cheap. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=70.72s)]
*  What you do is what you believe. What you do is what you believe. And everything else is just [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=80.64s)]
*  cottage cheese. As I said, I know the vice president well. I've served with her for seven [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=87.2s)]
*  and a half years. I know what she will do as president. She is a San Francisco Democrat. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=94.08s)]
*  She is a card carrying member of the loon wing of the Democratic Party. Well, Republicans are not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=104.16s)]
*  perfect, but the loon wing of the Democratic Party is crazy. I've described Ms. Harris as AOC [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  without the bartending experience. And I think that's accurate. That's how she'll govern. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=124.32s)]
*  And I'll be glad to talk about specifics in her record. She has one, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=130.72s)]
*  but you did a pretty good job of it yourself there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=135.76s)]
*  Well, let's talk a little bit more about energy because it's an issue all around the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=140.0s)]
*  It's one of the top issues for Donald Trump in putting this country back on the right track. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=145.2s)]
*  She says that she was never opposed to fracking. I mean, I'm so confused by what she's saying [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=151.2s)]
*  as if there's no videotape to show exactly what she said on fracking and energy. You saw her. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=158.32s)]
*  She cast the deciding vote on many of these issues right there in the Senate. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=165.28s)]
*  Well, I watched the vice president cast the tie-breaking vote in favor, for example, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=172.72s)]
*  of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is just the green new deal. I think most Americans [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=180.64s)]
*  are all of the above-energy type people. They are for every form of energy that is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=190.64s)]
*  affordable and accessible, but that includes fossil fuels. I think the vice president does not [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  support fossil fuels. She sued all the oil companies when she was the attorney general [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=205.44s)]
*  of California. As I said before, I support other forms of energy, but I also support fossil fuels [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=211.2s)]
*  because we have to have them. I think I said one time, my car doesn't run off of fairy dust and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=221.04s)]
*  unicorn urine, and that's true. I think fossil fuels are going to be part of satisfying our energy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=229.68s)]
*  needs for a long, long time, probably forever. It doesn't mean we shouldn't pursue others. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=242.88s)]
*  The problem is that the part of the Democratic Party that Ms. Harris is from, they don't believe [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=248.96s)]
*  in fossil fuels. They just don't. They believe in wind, solar, and wishful thinking. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=255.76s)]
*  Yeah. I really do wish somebody would ask the vice president to define inflation, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=264.56s)]
*  because I'm fairly convinced she doesn't know what inflation is, let alone how to solve it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=270.0s)]
*  and she acts as if they haven't been in a position to deal with it and that she'll get around to it [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=274.96s)]
*  if she's elected sometime in January. Well, Ms. Harris helped create the worst inflation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=280.16s)]
*  in 40 years in America. When she and President Biden took over in 2021, a house that cost [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  $304,000 cost $423,000 today. Her plan to try to lower prices looks like it was put together with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=297.04s)]
*  vodka and darts. She wants price controls. She wants to raise the top federal income tax bracket. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=308.24s)]
*  She wants to tax unrealized capital gains. It will make higher prices even higher. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=317.52s)]
*  It will cause a lot of people to lose their jobs and others to see their wages lowered [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  at a time when they need that income. I don't know where she came up with her plan, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=331.2s)]
*  but I know what the result will be. And Bidenomics to me is very simple. As I've said before, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=338.08s)]
*  Bidenomics is easy. It's defining it's easy. It's paying more to live worse. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Great. Senator Kennedy, we always appreciate your perspective. Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96GK8PUEeig&t=355.12s)]
