# Turley projects outcome of SCOTUS case on gender treatment for minors
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk)
*  Right here with analysis, Fox News contributor, George Washington University law professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=4.64s)]
*  To me, it was interesting how the justices approached it in a different way. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=6.4s)]
*  For example, Justice Alito went at it from a medical point of view and medical science [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=12.42s)]
*  and different studies and contradicted some of the studies that were being cited. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=17.2s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh said, isn't this a state issue? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=22.28s)]
*  To me, it's also a parental rights issue, don't you think? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=25.98s)]
*  Well, it's all of that and so much more. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=30.56s)]
*  There were moments in this argument that were quite sporty. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=33.76s)]
*  I mean, you had Justice Alito asking the Solicitor General whether she wanted to take back part [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=38.32s)]
*  of her filing with the court, because she stated there's overwhelming evidence that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=44.4s)]
*  this treatment is necessary and safe and does not have these problems in the vast majority [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=49.44s)]
*  of cases. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=55.68s)]
*  Alito said right after you gave that to us, this CAS report came out, which joined other [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=56.76s)]
*  European reports, saying the opposite, that there are serious questions about the efficacy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=60.92s)]
*  of the treatment, about the effects on these children. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=66.5s)]
*  And he said, you want to change your statement about that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=70.52s)]
*  Of course, she declined. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=73.84s)]
*  But there was a lot of uncomfortable moments and not surprisingly given the subject matter, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=75.42s)]
*  including when the Solicitor General was asked, where do you draw the line on things like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=80.28s)]
*  sports when we get to those questions? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=83.92s)]
*  Is there a constitutional right here that it will extend far beyond the question of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=86.92s)]
*  treatment? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=92.64s)]
*  And the Biden administration said, well, you know what, you can work on that, essentially. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=93.64s)]
*  They sort of shrugged and didn't give a very clear answer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  And that, I think, really undermined them a great deal, because these justices were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  very concerned about the implications. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=105.84s)]
*  And keep in mind, these conservative justices have shown great sensitivities. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=108.44s)]
*  They did today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=112.6s)]
*  They said, look, their arguments had both sides of this issue. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=114.28s)]
*  And they showed a great deal of respect to both sides. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=117.36s)]
*  But they said, isn't that the point? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that there's this good faith disagreement between parents, between states. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=122.72s)]
*  Shouldn't we leave this to the political process and to the states to resolve? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=130.0s)]
*  And that view seems to have a majority of the court. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=134.84s)]
*  If you look around the nine members during the oral argument, that can change. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=138.88s)]
*  Most of us were looking most carefully at Justices Gorsuch and Barrett. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=143.56s)]
*  Gorsuch was strikingly quiet. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=148.8s)]
*  Barrett asked questions on both sides. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=152.68s)]
*  But keep in mind, in 2020, Chief Justice Roberts joined Gorsuch, who wrote an opinion that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  supported transgender protections in workplace discrimination. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  But Roberts today made it very clear that this seemed like something that should not [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  be left up to the court. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=173.84s)]
*  Well, let me go back to the Alito part of this, because they were making the argument [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=174.84s)]
*  to the court that there is substantial overwhelming evidence establishing appropriate gender-affirming [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=181.28s)]
*  treatment with puberty blockers, hormones directly and substantially improving the physical, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  psychological well-being of transgender adults, adolescents, rather, and gender dysphoria. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  And then Alito goes on and says, excuse me, the Swedish National Board of Health, I mean, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=203.04s)]
*  he had done his homework. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=208.64s)]
*  And he goes on to say, said that, sorry, they assessed the risk of puberty blockers and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=209.64s)]
*  gender-affirming treatment likely outweigh any expected benefit of these treatments. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  That was a pretty solid beatdown. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  And you rightly point out they were given an opportunity to kind of retract the definitive [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  statement that was made in light of the new scientific evidence. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  I thought that was interesting. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=234.44s)]
*  I thought it was. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=235.44s)]
*  And you know, the justice said, I see studies on both sides here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=238.44s)]
*  I see arguments on both sides. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=242.12s)]
*  But why do you think that we, nine non-doctors, non-experts, should come in and make that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=244.2s)]
*  decision for the states? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=250.56s)]
*  This is a matter to field in flux when it comes to the science. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=252.96s)]
*  And that's putting it lightly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  There are many people that disagree significantly with what the administration was saying. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=258.36s)]
*  And that's why it really seemed reminiscent for many people of the COVID period, where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  you couldn't question what the CDC and others were saying about the six-foot rule or the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=266.72s)]
*  efficacy of masks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=272.16s)]
*  There was a certain orthodoxy that if you question it, somehow you must be in favor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=274.4s)]
*  of COVID or you don't care much about the lives of your fellow citizens. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  There's that same feel on this one that the justices tried to make clear that, you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  know, they have supported transgender rights. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=290.76s)]
*  You have Chief Justice Roberts and Gorsuch, who just in 2020 did that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=293.68s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that the court should then take this entire matter away from states, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=298.84s)]
*  parents and others. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=304.96s)]
*  Now, there's parents on both sides on this question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=305.96s)]
*  Now, and they recognize that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=308.0s)]
*  There are parents that are consenting for their children. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=309.96s)]
*  What about California, Minnesota, gender-affirming care without parental consent? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=313.08s)]
*  What do you do in that case? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=319.52s)]
*  And I think that's reason your point is a good one, Sean, about parental rights. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=320.52s)]
*  You know, parental rights is often not discussed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=324.52s)]
*  It's viewed as sort of the weaker of the panoply of rights that we supposedly hold. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=327.44s)]
*  But many parents are objecting that their children can't even get an aspirin in school [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  without their consent, but they can get so much else that might change their identity [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=340.64s)]
*  and set them on a path that they want to be part of that decision-making. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=347.04s)]
*  They want to play a role. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=351.12s)]
*  They know that child better than anyone. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=352.2s)]
*  And I think that you're right about this argument bringing together all of these social [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=354.96s)]
*  and political and medical and ethical questions. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=360.4s)]
*  I predict, and it's hard to predict based on oral arguments, but I predict that this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=365.08s)]
*  will be sent back to the states. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  They'll let the states decide, the people in those states decide. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=370.96s)]
*  Where do you think this ends? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=374.52s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  I think if you do a head count, that's where I would put my money. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=380.84s)]
*  I'm going with you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=381.84s)]
*  You're the law professor, not me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think Justice Jonathan Turley sounds pretty good to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=387.11999999999995s)]
*  Maybe even Chief Justice one day. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=390.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=392.23999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=394.23999999999995s)]
*  From your lips to God's ears. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=395.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ55VMvNhjk&t=397.23999999999995s)]
