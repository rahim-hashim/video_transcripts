# Joe Concha: First debate will be 'the beginning of the end' of the Harris-Walz 'Candyland candidacy'
**Fox News:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're continuing to monitor Kamala's interview on CNN. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=3.6s)]
*  It's her first time sitting down with the press since Joe Biden dropped out of the race. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Here's what she told the network about how her position on fracking has changed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=11.28s)]
*  In 2019, you said, quote, there is no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=16.52s)]
*  Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=22.72s)]
*  Do you still want to ban fracking? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=28.2s)]
*  No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=30.56s)]
*  As vice president, I did not ban fracking. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=36.8s)]
*  As president, I will not ban fracking. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=39.16s)]
*  In 2019, I believe, at a town hall, you said you were asked, would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=42.68s)]
*  And you said, there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  So yes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=53.4s)]
*  So it changed in that campaign? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=57.8s)]
*  We are in 2024, and I've not changed that position, nor will I going forward. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Harris was also asked about her constant flip-flopping on issues including the border. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=64.88s)]
*  She said she suddenly believes that people should be prosecuted for illegally crossing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=70.24s)]
*  the border, the southern border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=75.78s)]
*  She said that she and Biden did good work on the economy, and she is proud of her record. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=78.28s)]
*  Harris even claimed Joe Biden was very clear from the beginning that he would endorse her after dropping out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=84.28s)]
*  And Harris' running mate Tim Walsh admitted that his grammar was incorrect when he claimed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  that he carried weapons of war in war, which he never did. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=97.16s)]
*  And here with the reaction is Fox News contributor Joe Conschup. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=102.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Good evening, Joe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=106.84s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=107.84s)]
*  How are you, Janine? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=108.84s)]
*  I'm not well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  First of all, she said that she wants to ban fracking, OK? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=112.76s)]
*  And when she was asked to follow up by Dana Bash, she said, well, I made clear on the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=116.96s)]
*  debate stage that I was against fracking, and I haven't done anything since that 2020. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=123.08s)]
*  Didn't she—what is she talking about, Joe? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=129.36s)]
*  She's lying, Judge, no question. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=134.48s)]
*  I think we found there's a reason why Kamala Harris has avoided talking to the press for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=137.36s)]
*  nearly six weeks since essentially becoming the Democratic nominee. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=141.44s)]
*  You take away her teleprompter, and it's a train-recolysis hot mess of a dumpster fire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=144.6s)]
*  A few things to unpack here from this interview. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=149.68s)]
*  For starters, the opening to the interview—and I know you're on the air, but I watched it—looked [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  more like a campaign commercial produced by the Kamala Harris campaign itself. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=155.84s)]
*  Many of the questions that Dana Bash asked, they were the rhetorical version of a hot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=160.68s)]
*  stone massage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=164.4s)]
*  And the lies Kamala Harris, with her emotional support pooch—Tim Walsh by her side, by [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=165.68s)]
*  the way—the lies she told in her interview, Janine, were on Baghdad-Bah levels. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=170.88s)]
*  For example, to your point, she says she's now not for banning fracking, and she said [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=175.04s)]
*  she made it clear in 2020 that when she ran for president on a debate stage that she was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=180.96s)]
*  not for banning fracking. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=185.28s)]
*  Well, there's one problem. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  She wasn't even a candidate in 2020. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=187.72s)]
*  She dropped out before then. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=189.96s)]
*  She dropped out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=190.96s)]
*  I can't find any proof. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=191.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=192.96s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=193.96s)]
*  And I can't find any proof. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=194.96s)]
*  I looked for it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=195.96s)]
*  She said that she supported fracking four years ago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=196.96s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=199.84s)]
*  In fact, the Biden-Harris administration on day one, Janine, banned fracking on federal [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=200.84s)]
*  land. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=205.4s)]
*  So there goes that argument. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=206.4s)]
*  But of course, Dana Bash didn't bother to bring that part up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=207.4s)]
*  And by the way, during a town hall during that campaign in 2019, Kamala Harris said [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  she was, quote, 100 percent against banning fracking. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=214.76s)]
*  The big picture here, Judge—and we've talked about this before—that when you take [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=219.08s)]
*  away a teleprompter and the prescriptive remarks from Kamala Harris, she becomes a human Chernobyl. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=222.24s)]
*  Let's read this money quote again from this interview, because I've read it 10 times, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=228.68s)]
*  and I still have zero idea what she's talking about. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=231.6s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris, quote, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned the Green New Deal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  I have always believed, and I've worked on it, that climate change is real, that it is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=240.44s)]
*  deadlines around time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah, deadlines should apply to time. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=246.96s)]
*  How utterly profound. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  This did not go well at all, and this is a big turning point in this election. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=250.52s)]
*  No question about it, Janine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=254.32s)]
*  Well, you know, and if she wants to talk about metrics around time, she can say that she's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  against the EV mandate, which she's the one who, I believe, sponsored the bill. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=261.68s)]
*  And in addition to that, the bill had times built in where, after 2030, you had to have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=266.84s)]
*  only 50 percent of the cars could be fossil fuel or gas-fueled, and by 2040, 45—I mean, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=272.12s)]
*  these are not flip-flops, Joe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=278.44s)]
*  These are lies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=280.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=281.92s)]
*  I want to call for the—do we have something on the side? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=282.92s)]
*  Is there something on the border? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay, let's hear this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Just one other question about something that you said in 2019. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  When you first ran, there was a debate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=294.2s)]
*  You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you still believe that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  I believe there should be consequence. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=304.36s)]
*  We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=306.0s)]
*  who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=311.84s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=315.28s)]
*  In this race, I'm the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=316.4s)]
*  who are trafficking guns, drugs, and human beings. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=323.32s)]
*  I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=326.2s)]
*  to enforce our laws, and I would enforce our laws as president going forward. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  I recognize the problem. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=336.4s)]
*  This woman is lying. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  The fact that she says our laws are meant to be followed and enforced, what, you decided [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=340.52s)]
*  that all the laws about the border shouldn't be followed and there should be consequences [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  transnational criminal organizations? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=348.88s)]
*  What the hell have you done for the past three and a half years? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=351.56s)]
*  Go ahead, Joe. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=355.88s)]
*  Precisely, Jeanine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=357.56s)]
*  And this was so horribly produced, by the way, by CNN. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=358.84s)]
*  The old—Tim Russert, when I used to watch Meet the Press, because I was a dork in college [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=362.28s)]
*  and apparently thought it was cool to watch Meet the Press on Sunday mornings instead [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  of Sports Center, for example. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=369.16s)]
*  I did both, actually. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=370.16s)]
*  I wasn't so hip, either. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=371.16s)]
*  Tim Russert used to— [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=372.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=373.16s)]
*  But Russert used to play back clips, right, for a politician that he was interviewing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=374.16s)]
*  He would play the literal words of that person and then have that person react to it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=379.12s)]
*  Why CNN, particularly since this had post-edit, in other words, it was a packaged type of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  presentation, it was pre-taped, why didn't they play her words for her and then have [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  her react to it? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=395.0s)]
*  That would have been so much more effective. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=396.16s)]
*  And then she talked about also that she's maintaining her values. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, I guess that means she does want to abolish ICE, because she said that on tape, too. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=400.8s)]
*  That means she does believe that illegal border crossings should be legal. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=405.32s)]
*  That means she wants to provide health insurance to all those who enter this country illegally, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=409.36s)]
*  for free, mind you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=413.36s)]
*  That means she wants to end the health—private health industry. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  That means she thinks that sanctuary cities work. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=417.74s)]
*  That means she thinks that men can actually get pregnant. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  And that means she thinks that gun buyback programs work and raising taxes on small business [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  won't result in higher prices for consumers or anything. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=426.68s)]
*  I mean, we could go on here, Janine, but we've got finite time here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=429.56s)]
*  The bottom line is that we will not see Kamala Harris do another interview before that debate [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=432.52s)]
*  with Donald Trump on September 10th. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=436.64s)]
*  And when that debate happens, if tonight is any indication, if Donald Trump is disciplined [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=438.4s)]
*  and ready, like he was on June 27th against Biden, it will be the beginning of the end [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=442.4s)]
*  of the Kamala Harris-Tim Walls-Candy Land candidacy, because this got really exposed [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=446.76s)]
*  tonight. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=451.56s)]
*  No question. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=452.56s)]
*  It was very exposed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=453.56s)]
*  Also, ending cash bail. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=454.56s)]
*  Is that still your value? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=455.6s)]
*  You want to prosecute them and then let them out of jail? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=456.6s)]
*  I mean, it's the same as in Warner Brothers. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=458.6s)]
*  I want to—we've got some sound here, I think, on Walls, her emotional support guy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=460.48s)]
*  The idea that you said that you were in war. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=468.32s)]
*  Did you misspeak, as the campaign has said? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, I said we were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=472.64s)]
*  ideas of carrying these weapons of war. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=476.16s)]
*  And my wife, the English, she told me my grammar is not always correct. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=478.36s)]
*  But again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me, or [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=481.48s)]
*  it's an attack on my dog, I'm not going to do that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  And the one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  This isn't about grammar. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=492.88s)]
*  This is about a lie. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  He's playing the victim here, Tim Walls, isn't he? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=498.36s)]
*  Like, oh, they're attacking me because I misspoke. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=500.76s)]
*  You didn't misspeak, pal. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  You left your unit when they were deployed to a war zone because you didn't want to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=505.16s)]
*  fight anymore. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  Grammar, please. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=512.32s)]
*  They're so phony, inauthentic. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=513.32s)]
*  This is a train wreck. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=514.32s)]
*  He also lied about his status, Commander Sergeant Major. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCL1kaOTCjU&t=515.32s)]
