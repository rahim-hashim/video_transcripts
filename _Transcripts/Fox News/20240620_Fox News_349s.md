# Sean Hannity: Americans aren't buying this lie
**Fox News:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY)
*  We begin with a brand-new swing state poll from Emerson College. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=3.68s)]
*  In Arizona, Donald Trump is up by four. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=5.08s)]
*  In Georgia, Donald Trump is also up by four. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=7.16s)]
*  In Wisconsin, Trump is up by three. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=9.88s)]
*  In Nevada, Trump is up by three again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=12.36s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, he's up by two. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  In Michigan, he's up by one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=16.56s)]
*  And in the traditionally very, very blue state of Minnesota, Trump and Biden are tied, 45-45. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=18.48s)]
*  In other words, according to a pretty reputable poll, Trump is ahead in every single battleground [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=25.16s)]
*  state and tied in Minnesota. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=30.4s)]
*  Add in two recent polls from Virginia showing a dead-even race in the Commonwealth and pretty [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=32.52s)]
*  good news to Donald Trump today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=38.68s)]
*  However, I do caution everybody. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=40.8s)]
*  We are 137 days away until Election Day, and that is an eternity in terms of politics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=43.46s)]
*  A lot can happen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=50.84s)]
*  Early voting begins in Pennsylvania in only 88 short days, and all the other states roll [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=52.28s)]
*  out after that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=57.52s)]
*  However, it gives us a snapshot into the election today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  And what are people seeing? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=63.36s)]
*  They're seeing Biden's policies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=64.36s)]
*  They're a disaster. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=65.92s)]
*  Americans see that their president is a cognitive mess, and they're not buyingâ€”these are [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=67.84s)]
*  cheap fake videos. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=73.0s)]
*  They're not buying that lie. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  It shows that a weaponized Department of Justice isn't even working out the way Democrats [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  had planned on it working out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=81.04s)]
*  And to make matters worse for Joe Biden, well, he now has the weakest poll numbers among [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=82.84s)]
*  women since John Kerry in 2004, and Joe is down by double digits among American men. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=87.84s)]
*  But again, it's still a tight race, and that will likely be decided by two or three states [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=95.72s)]
*  where the polls are well within the margin of error. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=100.98s)]
*  Take nothing for granted. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  So make no mistake, the stakes for next Thursday's CNN presidential debate are extremely high. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=105.48s)]
*  Here's what Democratic strategist Van Jones had to say. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=111.52s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=114.6s)]
*  And, Van, how big of a moment is this for the president? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=115.6s)]
*  I mean, I talked to folks in the Biden world Democratic Party, and they say this is a hugely [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  important moment for the president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  This is the entire election, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=126.88s)]
*  The entire world will be watching. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=130.04s)]
*  If you are a carbon-based life form, you're going to be watching. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=133.48s)]
*  If you've got a functioning brain stem, you're going to be watching. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=136.44s)]
*  Because if Biden goes out there and messes up, it's game over. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=139.96s)]
*  If he walks out there and a week later he's lower in the polls, it's panic in the party. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=145.08s)]
*  I don't necessarily agree with Van Jones. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=148.72s)]
*  While we definitely have accurately documented Biden's very troubling cognitive struggles [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=152.8s)]
*  for years, we've been way ahead of the curve. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=157.16s)]
*  Don't expect that Joe Biden that we see on a daily basis to show up at that debate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=160.72s)]
*  This brings us to the legend of Jacked Up Joe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=166.0s)]
*  On a rare occasion during an important speech, Biden's demeanor became very different. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=169.36s)]
*  The mumbling, the bumbling, the stumbling, the fumbling got replaced with screaming. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=174.92s)]
*  And the confusion was masked by aggression. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=180.12s)]
*  His heart rate was up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=184.24s)]
*  His eyes were bulging. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=185.52s)]
*  His speech was fast. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=186.94s)]
*  His behavior was weird, kind of like a kid who had coffee for the first time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=188.2s)]
*  Last appeared at the State of the Union address. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=194.0s)]
*  That was back in March. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  We haven't seen it since. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=197.0s)]
*  Now we don't know if it's caffeine, adrenaline, I don't know, or something else. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  But next Thursday, I fully expect a return of Jacked Up Joe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=204.44s)]
*  Now, of course, if Biden is able to string two sentences together, Joe's friends in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=208.44s)]
*  state-run media like MSDNC, Fake News CNN, oh, he actually, he survived. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=213.02s)]
*  That's a victory. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=218.88s)]
*  He won. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=219.88s)]
*  The dump-de-dumpties of the world, they'll be dancing in the street. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Fake Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will probably be sharing high fives behind the scenes, because [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  probably half the questions, let's talk about January 6th, let's talk about 2020, let's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=229.56s)]
*  talk about democracy in peril, let's talk about anything other than the issues that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  would actually matter to people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=240.78s)]
*  And then, of course, we'll have Jacked Up Joe. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  He will fade back into oblivion. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=245.46s)]
*  And then mumbling, bumbling, stumbling, Joe will return. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=247.44s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  Apparently, for the next seven days and seven nights, the Biden team, they are busy summoning [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  up Jacked Up Joe, and they're doing it in the woods at Camp David. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=256.58s)]
*  According to the White House, Biden will spend the entire week prepping for the CNN presidential [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=260.56s)]
*  debate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=266.24s)]
*  It's only 90 minutes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=267.24s)]
*  There are no public events, no meetings. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=268.36s)]
*  Nothing else is scheduled. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  The president of the United States will simply suspend his pretty important day job for a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=272.44s)]
*  week to prepare for this debate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=277.28s)]
*  Wouldn't it be great to have a president who could actually walk and chew gum at the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=280.56s)]
*  same time? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=282.96s)]
*  I know I'm asking for a lot. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=283.96s)]
*  Someone that doesn't need an entire week of preparation for a 90-minute discussion? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=285.96s)]
*  Now, we spend many, many hours prepping for the show every day and many hours doing three [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=291.36s)]
*  hours of radio every day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=295.82s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know if I can spend an entire week preparing for a one-hour or [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=298.32s)]
*  two-hour show. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=303.06s)]
*  It's kind of bizarre. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=304.06s)]
*  The fact that the mob, the media, is pretending that this is business as usual is predictable, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=305.64s)]
*  but it's repulsive as usual. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=311.3s)]
*  Now, will either of CNN's far-left moderators, they're really liberal talk show hosts, ask [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  Biden why he needed an entire week of solitude to prepare for the debate? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=318.52s)]
*  The chances of that are next to zero. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=323.12s)]
*  We know it's a stacked debate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=325.28s)]
*  We know it's three-on-one against Donald Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=327.02s)]
*  And yet, Democrats are still noticeably petrified that Biden will embarrass the entire party. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=329.62s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzNwG0Bn7VY&t=335.56s)]
