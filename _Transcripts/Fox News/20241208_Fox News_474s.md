# Sylvester Stallone, wife Jennifer Flavin share how they met
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y)
*  All right, we have a big announcement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a new show on Fox Nation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=3.12s)]
*  The first episode will drop tomorrow morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=4.84s)]
*  It's called Sean. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=7.08s)]
*  This show, very heavy politics. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=8.08s)]
*  No, on this show, I sit down with newsmakers, celebrities, long extended interviews like [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  you've never seen before. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=18.12s)]
*  Jillian Michaels, Stephen A. Smith, many more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I spoke with Sylvester Stallone, his wife, Jennifer Flavin Stallone. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=21.48s)]
*  Here's a sneak peek. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=25.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=26.96s)]
*  You're bringing us Sly. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=29.24s)]
*  Do you know Sly, Sylvester? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=31.24s)]
*  I think that Sly is a lot easier on the vowel than the syllable. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=33.24s)]
*  It's like that's a lot of syllables. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=38.24s)]
*  So Sly works great. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=40.24s)]
*  And Jennifer, great to see you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=42.24s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=44.24s)]
*  First, I got to say all my friends are like, oh, can I come? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Because everyone loves you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  Everyone relates to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Everyone identifies with Rocky, Rambo. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  I never knew you'd be such a good momster, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  You heard of him? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=58.28s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=59.28s)]
*  That's interesting, Sean, because Rocky, his idealism, his morality is something, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=60.28s)]
*  I aspire to be like, so you have to write it because I'm not that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=67.28s)]
*  And he's very chatty, but it's simplistic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=72.28s)]
*  And so people automatically assume Sly is right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=75.28s)]
*  There is no difference. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=79.28s)]
*  And Rambo is just the opposite. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=81.28s)]
*  He's like monosyllabic. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=83.28s)]
*  He's just giving up trying to speak. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  It feels as though he's been abandoned by civilization. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  So he's into his own thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Finally, if there comes an opportunity to play a gangster, but in a different way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  in other words, to use my real personality. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=101.32s)]
*  Why does Rocky, why does Rambo, but Rocky for me more than Rambo, and I love Rambo, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=104.32s)]
*  why does that hit me in the gut? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=111.36s)]
*  That whole series hits me in the gut. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=115.36s)]
*  It definitely, I can relate to it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=118.36s)]
*  My friends can relate to it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=121.36s)]
*  You just said it, Sean. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=123.36s)]
*  There's a relatability. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=124.36s)]
*  What I felt I was going through and trying to be like, what is my fate? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  What is my destiny? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  What is my capability? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  And the inability of getting that opportunity, it's a struggle. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=136.4s)]
*  And people, so many people have aspirations to do more and they don't get that opportunity. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=141.4s)]
*  So they live in this quiet frustration their whole life. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=149.4s)]
*  Like, please give me the opportunity to even fail. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=153.4s)]
*  Just put me in coach one time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=157.4s)]
*  Let me run the race. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=160.4s)]
*  If I'm last, at least I know I didn't have it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=161.4s)]
*  But to never be able to try to do your best to like get a shot, in other words, to simplify it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=165.44s)]
*  And it's a very simple story that people, even intellectuals, people that are perhaps in white collar jobs, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=173.44s)]
*  they can look at that and somehow glean something out of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=181.44s)]
*  Also, the need of hope. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=185.44s)]
*  In my profession or my life, I should say, the way I've been structured is my history with relationships is an abomination. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=189.48s)]
*  Can we say was an abomination? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=199.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=203.48s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't live without her. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=204.48s)]
*  I mean, she is my everything, my son, my moon, everything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=207.48s)]
*  But I was raised in an incredibly dysfunctional family. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=211.48s)]
*  No love, no pat, no handshake. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  You got the beat out of you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  A lot. Big time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Today, people would have been arrested. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  But in one part, and if I could take you, I have the ability to channel that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's why I think I'm successful, because I understand rejection. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  I understand hardship. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  I understand fear. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=242.56s)]
*  And if my father couldn't break me, nobody is going to break me. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=245.56s)]
*  See what I mean? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=250.56s)]
*  I know what it's like to live on a dark side. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=251.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=254.56s)]
*  Let's go back to you meet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=255.56s)]
*  I want to know the moment you met and what you were thinking. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=257.56s)]
*  And then I already know what you were thinking. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=261.56s)]
*  A friend of ours, a mutual friend, asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant in Hollywood. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=263.56s)]
*  And my girlfriend Kirsten and I, you know, we've all, I don't think I've ever went to Hollywood [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=269.6s)]
*  or even went out to dinner in Hollywood. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=275.6s)]
*  You lived in the valley, three miles away, she had never... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=278.6s)]
*  Not three miles, Sly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=281.6s)]
*  It's very close. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=282.6s)]
*  It was over the hill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=283.6s)]
*  I lived way over the hill. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=284.6s)]
*  Calabasas, Woodland Hills. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=285.6s)]
*  No, it was a good 45-minute drive. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=286.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=289.6s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=290.6s)]
*  There was no reason for me to be in Hollywood. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=291.6s)]
*  By the way, is this all the time? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=293.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=295.6s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=296.6s)]
*  We've been together 37 years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  20 years? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  What's over that hill? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  Sly. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  So I took my Dodge Duster. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  There it is. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  And drove over the hill to meet him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  Dodge Duster was a good car back in the day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, not mine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  Nothing worked. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  Nothing worked for this car. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  I didn't have even a gas cap. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  The fender was falling off. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=315.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it was awful. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  It was a mess of a car. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  So I meet him at this restaurant and he's sitting at a table with all these beautiful [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  women and my girlfriend and I were like, okay, we'll just join the crowd. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  And we did. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=326.68s)]
*  And he, I just, all these girls were all over him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=327.68s)]
*  And my girlfriend and I were just sitting there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=330.68s)]
*  But he started talking to me and my friend. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=332.68s)]
*  And I was like, why, you know, and they asked me what I did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=334.68s)]
*  And I said, well, I go to college and I work at Valley Tan. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=337.68s)]
*  And the whole table started laughing at me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=341.68s)]
*  And my girlfriend said, what did you say? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=343.68s)]
*  I go, I went to college and work at Valley Tan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=345.68s)]
*  Where were you in your career? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=348.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=349.68s)]
*  I was, you were there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=350.68s)]
*  I'm thinking there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmahhWQb9Y&t=351.68s)]
