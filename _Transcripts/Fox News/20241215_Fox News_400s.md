# Gov. Youngkin vows to take on sanctuary cities and work with ICE
**Fox News:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q)
*  Godspeed. This is an important job. Joining us now with more on his plan to ban sanctuary cities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The governor, the great Commonwealth of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin is with us. Governor, welcome back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=5.76s)]
*  Tell me about your plans. Sean, thank you. First of all, this is just basic common sense. There's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=10.0s)]
*  no controversy here. If you are not in this country legally and you commit a crime, you get a one-way [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=16.96s)]
*  ticket out of here. And it is so refreshing to hear a border czar do the job that a border czar must do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=23.52s)]
*  Thank you, Tom Homan. Today in Virginia, we made it very clear. I presented a clear pathway for us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=30.96s)]
*  to first make sure that localities, mayors, boards of supervisors and city councils must comply [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=38.64s)]
*  with ICE. And second of all, if you don't, I'm going to take away your funding. Bottom line is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Virginians have been suffering. Every state is a border state. And we've seen the Biden administration [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=52.08s)]
*  unleash chaos. Five Virginians dying every day from fentanyl overdoses. But even worse, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=57.68s)]
*  literally criminals who are in jail in our criminal justice system, being let loose and then [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=64.4s)]
*  committing horrendous crimes, sexual assaults of young women, murders. And just recently, of course, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=71.12s)]
*  a Honduran illegal immigrant who had been in 29 encounters with law enforcement released because [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=77.84s)]
*  Fairfax County did not want to cooperate with ICE, who then subsequently commits a violent rape. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=85.68s)]
*  This must stop. And I can't tell you how much it pleases me to know that we have a president and a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  border czar who are going to work with us to put a stop to this chapter that has been a horrific [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=97.44s)]
*  reminder that we are a nation of laws and if we do not enforce the laws and protect our citizens, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=104.16s)]
*  we are not doing the primary job we are elected to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=110.72s)]
*  When you, your opening statement, you said if there are people in this country that are illegal, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=114.56s)]
*  that have committed criminal acts, but isn't the act of entering the country [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=119.52s)]
*  without permission and authority, isn't that in and of itself illegal? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=124.64s)]
*  Doesn't that make everyone that entered this country illegal without proper documentation [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  permission? Sean, if we just begin with the reality that in our prisons and jails, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  there are thousands upon thousands of illegal immigrants who have committed violent crimes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  In Virginia, in our state corrections departments, we have nearly a thousand illegal immigrants [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  who have committed a violent crime. We are fully cooperating with ICE and we will make sure that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=159.84s)]
*  those people are deported. And this is the first place to start. Then we recognize, as disclosed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=165.12s)]
*  by ICE, that there are 650,000 committed felons in America today who we don't know where they are. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=171.84s)]
*  13,000 murderers, 15,000 of those guilty of sexual assaults and rape who are in America today, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=180.8s)]
*  we've got to find them and we've got to give them that one-way ticket out of here. There is a big [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=187.68s)]
*  job ahead of us, but as you have seen, governors across this country, particularly Republican [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=191.92s)]
*  governors, are locked arm to work with President Trump, to work with Tom Homan, to make sure that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=197.12s)]
*  we are keeping those citizens that we are responsible for safe. All right, so what do you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=202.64s)]
*  do in the case of, let's say, California? Our old friend Governor Gavin Newsom, it's a sanctuary [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=209.52s)]
*  state. Los Angeles just had a vote, they reiterated that they're a sanctuary city. The same with San [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Francisco. These are their stated policies. They have pledged not to help in any way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=222.24s)]
*  Comments by Governor Newsom indicate that he will want to challenge Donald Trump in court every [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=229.28s)]
*  step of the way on issues he disagrees with, but yet the authority to remove illegal immigrants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=235.6s)]
*  that are in this country illegally, that would lie with the federal government, not with the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  state of California. They have jurisdiction in that regard. So what do you do in that case when [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=246.4s)]
*  there's going to be that conflict? Well, let me first begin with Americans' need to stand up and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=252.4s)]
*  make their voices heard. And what we saw on November 5th was an overwhelming statement [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=260.08s)]
*  that Americans are tired of the liberal left progressive policies of putting criminals first [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=266.8s)]
*  and victims last, and on top of that, putting the rights of illegal immigrants ahead of the rights [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  of citizens. And so step one is Californians need to wake up and understand what exactly [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Gavin Newsom and the rest of the leadership there is doing. Second of all, I do believe that what [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  Tom Homan is expressing is in fact federal jurisdiction over so many of these circumstances. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=289.44s)]
*  And finally, I do believe finally that states like California that are not standing up for the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=296.0s)]
*  safety of their citizens are going to continue to see a mass exodus like they have to states that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=303.04s)]
*  are standing up for their citizens. There has been a massive migration in this country where [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=309.68s)]
*  Americans recognize that they want to build their lives in states that will stand for liberty and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=315.2s)]
*  freedom, that will stand for safety, that will create jobs, that will lower taxes and respect [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=320.32s)]
*  them as individuals. And this is so clear to the point where you're even seeing Democrat governors [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=326.32s)]
*  finally recognize that this is common sense and this is the way that the nation needs to go in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=332.08s)]
*  order to ensure our safety. Do you agree with me the odds are very high with known terrorists in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=337.36s)]
*  this country that they are likely plotting planning and scheming a terror attack inside [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=343.2s)]
*  the continental United States and that that is likely to happen? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=348.96s)]
*  Sean, I'm terribly concerned with the known number of terrorists that have come into this country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Listen, I am the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and we have the largest number of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=362.24s)]
*  national security assets from national intelligence to military to the largest naval base in the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=367.44s)]
*  world and we are on high alert all the time with regards to the threat that the open border has [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=373.12s)]
*  presented to us. We must be vigilant and the first step is to make sure that we're sending people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=379.52s)]
*  one way out of this country when they commit a crime. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FJ6XHi00Q&t=384.88s)]
