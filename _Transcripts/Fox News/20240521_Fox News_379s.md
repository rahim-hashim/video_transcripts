# Eric Trump: I’ve never seen anything like this
**Fox News:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk)
*  And now with reaction, Eric Trump, he was in the courtroom today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot you have to say. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=3.92s)]
*  I won't even ask a question. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=6.0s)]
*  But you were there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=7.92s)]
*  Do you want to describe to people what actually happened in there? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=8.92s)]
*  Because the media was kicked out and the courtroom was emptied. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  But you were there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Sean, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I've been by my father's side almost the entire time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=22.52s)]
*  I've been—I've spent many, many days in the front row of that court, and I've never [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=24.72s)]
*  seen anything like I saw today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=28.0s)]
*  You would think that transparency would be important in a court system, in front of a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  jury, to get to the actual truth. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=33.16s)]
*  That's normally what you're supposed to do in court. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=35.2s)]
*  And the exact opposite thing happened today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=37.16s)]
*  First of all, something's holding the judge back, and I think I know what it is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=39.92s)]
*  I think it's his daughter, who's apparently making millions and millions and millions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=43.0s)]
*  of dollars, raising millions for Democratic operatives around New York, because today [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  it was proven their star witness, Michael Cohen, has lied over and over and over again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  He lied to Congress. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=56.72s)]
*  He lied to Senate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=58.56s)]
*  He lied to the attorney general of New York. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=59.56s)]
*  He lied in the D.A. trial in New York. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=60.56s)]
*  He lied to the Southern District of New York. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=62.6s)]
*  He lied to his wife. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=64.92s)]
*  He lied to Judge Paulsy, which is the judge that sentenced him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=66.64s)]
*  He paid vendors in bags of cash. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=70.82s)]
*  He stole from our organization. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=73.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=75.48s)]
*  So then we asked the judge for a motion to dismiss after all these lies, after Michael [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=76.56s)]
*  agrees that he lied to all of these people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=81.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=83.12s)]
*  He's a serial perjurer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=84.12s)]
*  He's a serial liar. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=85.12s)]
*  He can't be trusted. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=86.12s)]
*  So he is their star witness. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  We asked for a motion to dismiss, and it just goes nowhere, because somebody is holding [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=89.24s)]
*  this judge back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=94.33999999999999s)]
*  And then when I look at what he did to Bob Costello, he wanted to tell his story. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  He knows the details of this better than anybody. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  He met with Cohen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  He said over and over and over again that Cohen kept on saying that Donald Trump did [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=102.58s)]
*  absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=107.8s)]
*  He has no information on Donald Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=109.28s)]
*  He did nothing illegal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  And at every single chance that he could, you know, he could stop him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=112.74s)]
*  He could sustain. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=117.02s)]
*  He would block him from any of that testimony. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=118.6s)]
*  Then, as you said before, the top FEC lawyer in the country wants to testify about how [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=121.22s)]
*  there is no crime here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  And again, he wouldn't allow the FEC lawyer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=129.34s)]
*  Transparency should be at the heart of this case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=131.7s)]
*  And the judge is blocking it at every single intersection. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=134.78s)]
*  And I sit there as a proud son, as a person who knows my father didn't do a damn thing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=138.1s)]
*  And you just watch a sham in New York at this kangaroo court where my father has been censored. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=143.34s)]
*  He's been admonished. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=148.94s)]
*  He's been embarrassed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=149.94s)]
*  He's been slandered. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=151.7s)]
*  He's been held off the campaign trail. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=152.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=154.62s)]
*  I mean, how much more does a person need to go through? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=155.62s)]
*  And how much more obvious can this be to every single American exactly what's happening right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=158.5s)]
*  now because my father, that man right there on the stage, is winning in every single swing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=164.22s)]
*  state. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=168.9s)]
*  He's mopping the floor with Biden right now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=169.9s)]
*  He's about to have one of the biggest rallies in New York history. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=172.82s)]
*  You saw what happened to Wildwood, New Jersey last week. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=175.3s)]
*  And they can't handle it, so they employ crooked judges, and they will not let him out of this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=179.02s)]
*  case even though it would have ended day one, second one, for any other person who didn't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=183.94s)]
*  have the last name Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, this has gotten worse and worse. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=190.74s)]
*  What I see happening, and tell me if this is your observation, especially when you look [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=194.78s)]
*  at the impeccable credentials of somebody like Bob Costello or Bradley Smith, who we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  just played. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  And I just think this is a Biden donor judge. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=207.04s)]
*  You brought up, you know, it's been written about extensively, about the daughter and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=211.88s)]
*  her political activities and questions about whether she might benefit as a result of this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  trial. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  He should have recused himself, a misdemeanor whose statute of limitations have run out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  Nobody can even identify. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=228.6s)]
*  I bet if I surveyed the jurors today, they couldn't even tell you what the crime is, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=229.6s)]
*  that brag, the theory is, because it doesn't exist. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=234.8s)]
*  And this is now, this is the country we're living in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=238.4s)]
*  I think it's backfiring. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=241.52s)]
*  I think it's boomeranging. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=242.76s)]
*  And as hard as it is for you and your family and your father, the fact that they are, he's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=244.56s)]
*  desperately trying to throw them a lifeline tells me that judge knows they lost. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=250.32s)]
*  Let me put it in context, Sean, and their whole tactic is to embarrass and confuse people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=257.52s)]
*  But this is $130,000 from eight years ago, and they have charged my father with 34 felony [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=262.79999999999995s)]
*  counts, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  While they shut down all of New York, every morning they shut down the FDR drive on the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=270.88s)]
*  way down, then they surround the courthouse for literally blocks and blocks with the biggest [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  law enforcement presence you've ever seen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=278.64s)]
*  Then they close the FDR on the way uptown. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=280.94s)]
*  You have every single DA in New York, the top brass of the DA's office, they're all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=283.36s)]
*  sitting there, they're all giggling, the resources, the years of time that they've spent on this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  For $130,000 from eight years ago, for an accountant that booked a legal expense, a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=292.8s)]
*  longtime personal attorney, as a legal expense, no one believes it as little kids are getting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=298.2s)]
*  shot in New York and women are getting hurt and people are getting mugged and illegal [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=303.64s)]
*  immigrants are taking over the city. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  And you can't shop at CVS because everything's locked behind plexiglass because there's so [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=310.0s)]
*  much shoplifting. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=313.88s)]
*  No one believes this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=315.26s)]
*  This is legal lawfare. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=316.84s)]
*  What they've been doing to my father since he came down that escalator. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=318.74s)]
*  This is no surprise to anybody. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=322.56s)]
*  They're out to get the guy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=324.02s)]
*  Alvin Bragg will stop at nothing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=325.24s)]
*  And by the way, guys like Soros are telling him, you take down Donald Trump because otherwise [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=327.4s)]
*  we're going to have a real problem November 5th. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=331.9s)]
*  And the whole country is getting it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=334.04s)]
*  The whole country is seeing it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=336.3s)]
*  Our fundraising is off the charts. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=337.92s)]
*  Because of it, he's winning in the polls because of it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=339.64s)]
*  You know, it's a law of adverse consequences. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=342.16s)]
*  You know, sometimes things that they can't see come back and bite them in the butt. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=344.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=347.36s)]
*  But it's just a shame that that great man right there has to sit through this nonsense. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=348.96s)]
*  He's a great president. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=353.06s)]
*  He's a great person. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=354.06s)]
*  He's a great father. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=355.06s)]
*  And this country deserves a lot better than this nonsense. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=356.06s)]
*  Well, I'm going to agree with that last part. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=358.96s)]
*  This country deserves so much better. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=361.82s)]
*  And it's sad. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGO5JenF8Rk&t=364.28s)]
