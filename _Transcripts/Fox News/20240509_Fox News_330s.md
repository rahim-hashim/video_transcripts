# Sean Hannity: This bogus Trump trial has gone off the rails
**Fox News:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns)
*  But we begin with Juan Mershaw's. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Kangaroo Court in New York City, this nothing but bogus politically motivated trial [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=2.88s)]
*  against Donald Trump has gone totally, completely off the rails. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=8.32s)]
*  And we still have not heard from the prosecution's star witness, you know, the convicted felon, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=12.24s)]
*  notorious liar Michael Cohen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=17.6s)]
*  We'll have more on that in a moment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=19.36s)]
*  Now, this week, as a prelude to Cohen, well, the Biden-loving prosecutors called a career [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=21.36s)]
*  porn actress to the stand whose testimony apparently serves no other purpose than to smear, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=27.36s)]
*  besmirch and slander Donald Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=33.36s)]
*  On Tuesday, she horrified jurors with her, quote, so-called jokes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=35.84s)]
*  They were inappropriate, graphic stories, erotic physical gestures, totally unrelated to the case. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=42.0s)]
*  And all of her testimony has been irrelevant and immaterial despite being prepped by the prosecution. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=48.96s)]
*  Wasn't that nicer than to prepare her? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=55.92s)]
*  And today during cross-examination, while things got even more strange and maybe a little bit spooky, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=57.92s)]
*  even fake news CNN, they couldn't believe what they were hearing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=64.08s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Nicholas S. Sopranos has claimed she can speak with dead people and that her house in New Orleans [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=68.72s)]
*  is haunted. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=72.88s)]
*  I believe Sopranos was involved with some sort of paranormal show at some point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=73.44s)]
*  You have actually reached the limits of my knowledge of this case. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=77.44s)]
*  I am not familiar with her paranormal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=81.2s)]
*  I read the first question. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  The first question I cannot answer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=84.96s)]
*  Literally, we are now in the toilet and the realm of paranormal activity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=87.6s)]
*  It was a lot of interesting and unexplained activity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  A lot of the activity was completely debunked into the giant possum, she says with a laugh. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Time to go back to D.C. and Jim Acosta. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=98.32s)]
*  Jim, back to you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=100.32s)]
*  Gee, thanks Anderson. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if we're watching CNN or QVC. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=102.88s)]
*  That's the question I have right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  There were comments about candles and paranormal ghost hunting shows and so on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=108.8s)]
*  I feel like we're losing the narrative here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=119.12s)]
*  Salacious material and talking to the dead. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  This is not a serious trial in any way, shape, manner or form. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=126.16s)]
*  But it wasn't all ghosts and spirits during cross-examination. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=130.08s)]
*  President Trump's attorney caught Stormy Daniels in what looked like to be a lie. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=134.32s)]
*  Remember, Daniels said she felt pressured to sign the NDA with Trump because she feared for her [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=138.72s)]
*  safety. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=145.04s)]
*  But during a phone call recorded while recording that was played in court today, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=145.84s)]
*  Daniels' lawyer can be heard telling Michael Cohen, Stormy wanted money more than anything [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=149.92s)]
*  and was worried that she would lose leverage after the election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=156.16s)]
*  The trial is a disgrace. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=160.08s)]
*  The Biden-donating judge, Juan Mershon, should be ashamed for enabling this kangaroo court. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=161.84s)]
*  He should have recused himself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=167.76s)]
*  Any guilty verdict should be easily overturned on appeal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=169.52s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=172.72s)]
*  Will that happen after the election? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=174.16s)]
*  That would be a travesty of justice. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=176.72s)]
*  Mershon has already denied two motions for a mistrial, continues to muzzle Donald Trump [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=179.12s)]
*  with an unprecedented gag order. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  All while the prosecution and their witnesses, they get to say any and everything they want [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=186.56s)]
*  and even ask for gifts for their commentary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  So you got a porn star who hates Donald Trump, coached by prosecutors, who has already been [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  ordered to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars that she said she's never going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=200.0s)]
*  pay him after a failed defamation lawsuit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=204.48s)]
*  She can say whatever she wants about Trump, as everybody else can, about ghosts and spirits [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=207.44s)]
*  and graphic sexual encounters that have nothing to do with the bookkeeping case. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=213.68s)]
*  But Donald Trump can't say anything to defend himself against wild accusations from a person [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=218.24s)]
*  that seems to have a lot of problems. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=224.96s)]
*  But this case is about to get even worse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=226.96s)]
*  Alvin Bragg star witness Michael Cohn, not particularly reputable, is he? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  2018, Cohn pled guilty to eight serious charges, including tax evasion, lying to a bank, lying [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  to the Federal Elections Commission. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=240.96s)]
*  He was also convicted of making a false statement of Congress for lying on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=243.2s)]
*  Also, Cohn was recently referred to the DOJ yet again for prosecution over six other lies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=248.24s)]
*  to Congress. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=255.2s)]
*  So even more charges may very well be in his future. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=256.24s)]
*  But don't worry. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=260.08s)]
*  According to the prosecution, Cohn will definitely be telling the truth this time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=261.12s)]
*  You can totally trust him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, during the trial, Cohn has been spending hours live streaming on TikTok, soliciting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=268.0s)]
*  gifts from his very huge fan base. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=274.88s)]
*  Pretty pathetic. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, recently he wore a shirt depicting Donald Trump behind bars, and we're all supposed [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=279.36s)]
*  to believe that Michael Cohn has no ulterior motive in this case. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=284.24s)]
*  And yet, thanks to a Biden donor masquerading as a judge whose family may be compromised, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=288.64s)]
*  who should have recused himself, well, Michael Cohn can pretty much say and do whatever he wants. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=294.64s)]
*  Trump can say nothing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=300.0s)]
*  Trump's legal team appealed the gag order today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=301.76s)]
*  Of course, that was denied by the Biden donating judge. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=304.64s)]
*  Judge Mershon is not about to restore President Trump's First Amendment rights. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=308.4s)]
*  The Democrats have an election to win, and the judge is more than happy to lend a helping hand. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaxL75kYns&t=312.56s)]
