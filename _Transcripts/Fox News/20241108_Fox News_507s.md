*  If anyone still wonders why the Washington Post and all of these legacy media people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=64.66s)]
*  have lost all credibility, nobody trusts them, take a look at Jennifer Rubin. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=69.7s)]
*  But tonight it is official. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=74.82s)]
*  The Democrats are definitely in disarray. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=76.06s)]
*  Donald Trump has frankly, he has won and he has broken them, maybe beyond repair. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=78.7s)]
*  Now turn on any left-leaning outlet, the chaos, the infighting, the hysteria is through the roof. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  You decide. Take a look. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=90.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, but Donald Trump hates veterans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=91.86s)]
*  He called them suckers and losers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=96.14s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  He absolutely, despite he has his whole life, he has his entire life. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  I know you're super emotional. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=104.66s)]
*  I just. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=105.66s)]
*  Of course I am. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=106.66s)]
*  I'm terrified. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=107.66s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=108.66s)]
*  Democrats never got it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=109.66s)]
*  While we were looking at all of the crazy things Donald Trump was saying on the campaign [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=111.14s)]
*  trail, all of the frightening things Donald Trump was saying on the campaign trail, they [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  were looking at their wallet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=119.58s)]
*  They were looking what groceries cost, what gas costs, what rent costs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  We are being branded as the most extreme of us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=126.58s)]
*  It is not only politically problematic as we just saw, because none of this stuff helped [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=129.86s)]
*  the other day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=134.26s)]
*  Without a doubt, it's a problem. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=135.26s)]
*  But we need to take stock of why we are being held hostage to the far left. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=136.82s)]
*  In my view, there was an over listening to and an over lifting up of people who left [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=141.98s)]
*  Trump, not people who left the Democratic Party. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=147.14s)]
*  The people who left the Democratic Party are the people who are going to win in the future. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  The people who left Trump, the never Trumpers who have important voices and have, that is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=155.98s)]
*  not the winning coalition. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=160.62s)]
*  Joe, can you go back and maybe watch your own show and listen to the things you are [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=164.14s)]
*  saying? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=168.82s)]
*  You are guilty of the very thing you are saying liberals and Democrats are guilty of. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=169.82s)]
*  Now, the co-hosts of that hard-hitting news show, The View, they are having a very hard [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  time processing Donald Trump's win as they try to figure out just how many racists are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=179.66s)]
*  lurking in the shadows. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=185.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  The bigger question should be, yes, Sonny, why did they vote for him? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  In sweeping? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=193.94s)]
*  We need to be introspective. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=194.94s)]
*  If we voted for Kamala Harris, we need to say what didn't resonate with the voters? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=196.06s)]
*  Do you know what didn't resonate with the voters? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=199.86s)]
*  When they were saying we don't feel safe and the left focused on defund the police and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=201.94s)]
*  bail reform. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=205.58s)]
*  They also denied the border was a crisis and kept saying, no, no, no, it's fine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=206.58s)]
*  This is not a... [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=210.18s)]
*  There was a border bill though. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=211.18s)]
*  There was a border bill. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=212.78s)]
*  Yes, but, Joy, my point is they screamed and screamed and screamed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=213.78s)]
*  They didn't vote for him because he's a racist or a misogynist. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=216.9s)]
*  They voted because they needed help in their everyday lives. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  The majority of the country... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=223.18s)]
*  Because every stat coming out on the people willing to self-reflect are showing these... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=225.18s)]
*  Oh wait, they're going to say I'm a racist and a misogynist in the exit? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=230.22s)]
*  Joy really thinks every four million people are racist. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=233.06s)]
*  Who's going to say that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  Hey guys, no excuses this time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  They lost everything. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=238.62s)]
*  A country that allows its environment to be ravaged, its children to be shot, its wealth [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=239.62s)]
*  to be hoarded, its workers to be exploited, its poor to starve, its cops to murder. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=243.66s)]
*  Do you think America's the problem? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=247.38s)]
*  Is a country in trouble? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=248.38s)]
*  If we played any more of that, I'd have to give free extra strength, etc. to every one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=250.94s)]
*  of you out there watching. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=257.46s)]
*  Believe it or not, it actually gets worse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=258.62s)]
*  According to reports, Biden's staff and Kamala's staff, they've all turned on each other, blaming [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=261.38s)]
*  each other, making for a very awkward last few months. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=266.7s)]
*  And meanwhile, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just wrote an op-ed criticizing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=271.1s)]
*  Democrats for hiding Joe Biden's mental decline. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  I have a question for the former mayor. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=281.54s)]
*  Mr. Bloomberg, we on this program were reporting on this in 2020 before Joe went to Washington. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=283.74s)]
*  Don't you think you're a little late, Mr. Little? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=293.14s)]
*  And get this, apparently Democrats are now sparring over whether the left-wing Supreme [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  Court justice Sonia Sotomayor should be forced out of office, off the Supreme Court before [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=301.58s)]
*  Trump is sworn in so Biden can pick a replacement. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=308.86s)]
*  And some are even floating Kamala Harris for that position. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=312.74s)]
*  Can't make this up either. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=316.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=317.34s)]
*  I hope that Joe Biden makes the next 10 weeks as consequential as he can. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=318.34s)]
*  I don't care about drawing outside the lines of what Republicans may think about it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=323.42s)]
*  This is within your purview. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=327.22s)]
*  You can actually do it and you should do it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=328.74s)]
*  You know, one more thing, John, is you have a hell of a vice president right there who [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=330.94s)]
*  has a legal predegree to sit on the Supreme Court and let Republicans go crazy and hate [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  them even mentioning that option. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=340.82s)]
*  You're floating. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=342.46s)]
*  Are you floating? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=343.46s)]
*  This is, you know, 739 a.m. on the East Coast. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=344.46s)]
*  Did Bakari Sellers just float Vice President Kamala Harris as a potential Supreme Court [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=347.97999999999996s)]
*  nominee? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=351.61999999999995s)]
*  Not only am I floating it, but I want to stir up everything. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  I want people's heads to explode this morning so we go into the weekend just knowing that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=356.61999999999995s)]
*  the chaos has not ended just yet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  I have a sad prediction. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=364.14s)]
*  This is not only not going to stop, it's going to get worse. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=365.26s)]
*  The panic for them is real. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=368.62s)]
*  It is not a good time to be on the left. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=370.22s)]
*  And whether they realize it or not, the Democratic Party, the deep state, Washington [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=372.98s)]
*  bureaucracy, the state-run media mob are all facing a reckoning as President Donald J. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump can sit back, watch them implode without any need for retribution, which they claim [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=386.18s)]
*  he's going to be doing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3m4ReBeI6E&t=391.38s)]
