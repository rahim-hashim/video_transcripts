# Trump, Musk warn Americans what will lead the country to go bankrupt
**Fox News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo)
*  Welcome back to Hannity and we are in the Washington swamp where for years far-left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=0.0s)]
*  bureaucrats burned through your hard-earned tax dollars on woke political causes, Green [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=7.26s)]
*  New Dealism, transgenderism, and even anti-American propaganda. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=13.88s)]
*  Those days are now over. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  More of my interview with President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=21.12s)]
*  As I scroll this information, and I'll scroll a lot more than I'll mention to both [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=24.6s)]
*  of you, and this is the cost savings, I want people at home to understand this part. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=29.92s)]
*  Average America makes $66,000 a year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=36.22s)]
*  We have $37 trillion in national debt. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=39.68s)]
*  Now, all the money I'm about to mention and what we're going to scroll on our screen, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=43.44s)]
*  and all of this is going to foreign countries. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=49.0s)]
*  It is not being spent here in America for better schools, law and order. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=52.96s)]
*  I think the average taxpaying American should be mad as hell because their tax money is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=57.72s)]
*  being thoroughly spent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=61.48s)]
*  Alright, let me go to the second question first. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=62.8s)]
*  I want to know because people like Joni Ernst and houses... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=66.24s)]
*  Joni Ernst has been... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=70.32s)]
*  They tried to get... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=71.32s)]
*  Has tried for a long time and she's actually got a lot of good data. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=72.32s)]
*  Senator Ernst has been really helpful, actually. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but they actually hide what the real purpose of the spending is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=77.0s)]
*  In other words, they... [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  And this is a question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=88.0s)]
*  How did you decipher? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  It will say humanitarian blah, blah, blah in Serbia or Afghanistan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=92.48s)]
*  We even give money to China for crying out loud, which I think is nuts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=97.92s)]
*  We'll give money to the Taliban. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=100.8s)]
*  But money to the Taliban. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=102.88s)]
*  Like a lot. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=103.88s)]
*  Alright, so... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=104.88s)]
*  I'm like, for what? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=105.88s)]
*  I want to see the pictures of what they did. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=106.88s)]
*  But they try to obscure it, but then you got to the bottom line, which is what I'm now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=109.0s)]
*  scrolling on the screen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=114.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=115.08s)]
*  And that is 20 million on a Sesame Street show in Iraq, 56 million to boost tourism in Tunisia [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=116.08s)]
*  and Egypt, 40 million to build schools in Jordan, 11 million to tell the Vietnamese [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=122.64s)]
*  to stop burning trash, 45 million for DEI scholarships in Burma, 520 million for consultant-driven [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=127.52s)]
*  ESG investments in Africa, DEI programs in Serbia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=136.52s)]
*  The president's favorite. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=143.28s)]
*  I'm sure you love that taxpayer money was spent on a DEI musical in Ireland or a transgender [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=144.28s)]
*  opera in Colombia or a transgender comic book in Burma. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=150.52s)]
*  It sounds like, how can these things be real? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=155.0s)]
*  But this is actually what was done. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=156.52s)]
*  It sounds like a comedy sketch or something. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  I have 20 pages on this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=160.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=161.44s)]
*  It's a list a mile long. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=162.44s)]
*  If you had to put a number on it, how much do you think you've identified waste, fraud, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=164.12s)]
*  abuse, corruption at this point? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=168.84s)]
*  And again, we're going to be scrolling this throughout the program. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=170.84s)]
*  Well, the overall goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=174.24s)]
*  And if the deficit is not brought under control, America will go bankrupt. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=179.8s)]
*  This is a very important thing for people to understand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=183.68s)]
*  A country is no different from an individual in that if an individual overspends, an individual [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=186.4s)]
*  can go bankrupt. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=191.24s)]
*  And so can a country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=192.24s)]
*  And the massive waste, fraud and abuse that has been going on, which is leading to a $2 [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=194.48s)]
*  trillion a year deficit, that's what the president was handed on January 20th, a $2 [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=201.48s)]
*  trillion deficit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=206.2s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=207.2s)]
*  For this fiscal year? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=208.2s)]
*  $2 trillion, yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=209.8s)]
*  We inherited. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=210.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=211.8s)]
*  And inflation is back. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=212.8s)]
*  I'm only here for two and a half weeks. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=213.8s)]
*  That was January. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=215.6s)]
*  You were there for a week. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=216.6s)]
*  Inflation is back. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=217.6s)]
*  Now, think of it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=218.6s)]
*  Inflation is back. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=219.6s)]
*  And they said, oh, Trump, in fact, I had nothing to do with it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=220.6s)]
*  These people have run the country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=222.16s)]
*  They spent money like nobody's ever spent. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  They were given $9 trillion to throw out the window. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  $9 trillion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=231.56s)]
*  And they spent it on the Green New Scam, I call it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=232.88s)]
*  It's the greatest scam in the history of the country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=235.32s)]
*  One of them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=237.2s)]
*  We have a lot of them, I guess. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=238.2s)]
*  But one of them, dollar-wise, probably. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=239.2s)]
*  In DEI and wokeism and transgenderism. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=240.2s)]
*  Well, that's all part of it, yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=243.2s)]
*  And LGBTQ+. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  By the way, not in America. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  Other countries. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=248.56s)]
*  Not here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=249.56s)]
*  The amazing thing is when you see the teaching of DEI, $9 million. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=250.96s)]
*  How do you spend $9 million to teach? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=257.12s)]
*  No matter what it is, you could teach physics. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=258.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=260.4s)]
*  Totally. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=261.4s)]
*  You could go to MIT for a lot less. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=262.4s)]
*  It's expensive. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=263.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=264.4s)]
*  The teaching of DEI. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=265.4s)]
*  Expensive, yes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=266.4s)]
*  How much do you believe, Ilan, you've identified in waste, fraud, abuse, corruption now? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=267.4s)]
*  And how much do you anticipate you will? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=271.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=274.44s)]
*  Well, I think... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=275.44s)]
*  1%. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=277.64s)]
*  No, because it's so massive. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  This is huge money. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=281.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=282.52s)]
*  So what we found now is 1%. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=283.52s)]
*  We're just going to start again. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=285.52s)]
*  As good as they are, they're not going to find some contract that was crooked, you know, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=286.52s)]
*  crooked as hell. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=291.12s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be so much that isn't found. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=292.12s)]
*  But what is found, I think he's going to find a trillion dollars. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=294.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=297.68s)]
*  But I think it's a very small percentage compared to what it is. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=298.68s)]
*  Let me go to an area that I think is key. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=302.44s)]
*  And you talked about this in recent interviews, and that is we don't need a Department of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=306.24s)]
*  Education, okay? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=311.12s)]
*  And what some people are trying to do is stoke fears that, oh, my gosh, my kid's not going [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=313.68s)]
*  to get the money for education. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=320.36s)]
*  Or grandma's Social Security and Medicare. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=322.2s)]
*  This was a big promise of yours on the campaign trail. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=325.04s)]
*  So I really want to give you both an opportunity to assure the American people you will keep [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=327.88s)]
*  that money will be allocated for students, but with higher standards. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=335.04s)]
*  For example, I would assume associated with monies given or vouchers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=340.0s)]
*  So much. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  And then, Elon goes, but look, Social Security won't be touched other than this fraud or [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  something we're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=351.36s)]
*  Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=354.88s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=357.76s)]
*  I want you to. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=358.76s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=359.76s)]
*  Now, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we're going to get them out of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=360.76s)]
*  system and all of that fraud. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=364.0s)]
*  But it's not going to be touched. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=366.08s)]
*  School. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=367.64s)]
*  I want to bring school back to the states so that Iowa, Indiana, all these places, Idaho, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=368.64s)]
*  New Hampshire, there's so many places, the states. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=377.56s)]
*  I think at 35 really won't run well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=380.08s)]
*  And right now it's Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, China. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  China, can you imagine, has top schools. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  We're last. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=393.88s)]
*  So they have a list of 40 countries. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=395.36s)]
*  We're number 40. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=397.84s)]
*  Usually we're 38, 39. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=398.84s)]
*  The last time we were number 40. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=400.08s)]
*  And what I say is you've got to give it back. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=402.96s)]
*  So it doesn't work. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you what we're number one in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=405.8s)]
*  Cost per pupil. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=407.52s)]
*  We spend more money than any other country by far. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=409.24s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=412.48s)]
*  Per pupil. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=413.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=414.48s)]
*  So we know it doesn't work. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=415.48s)]
*  So we spend the most and we have the worst, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=416.8s)]
*  The worst result. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=418.64s)]
*  When we give that back to Indiana, when we give that back to Iowa and back to a lot of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  the states that run well, they run well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=427.76s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=430.28s)]
*  35, 37, 38. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=431.76s)]
*  Now, you're going to have 10 laggards, but you're going to have five real laggards. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=432.76s)]
*  But that's going to be okay. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=436.64s)]
*  Take New York. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  You give it to Westchester County. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  You give it to Suffolk County. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  You give it to upstate New York. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=443.52s)]
*  And you give it to Manhattan. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=446.08s)]
*  You give it to four or five subsections. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=447.7s)]
*  Same thing in California. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=450.7s)]
*  Los Angeles is going to be a problem, but you're going to give it to places that run [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=451.7s)]
*  well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=456.42s)]
*  We can change education. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=457.42s)]
*  Now, school choice is important, but that we'll get taken care of automatically. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=458.82s)]
*  We want to bring education back to the states. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=464.9s)]
*  You will spend half the number. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  So you mean numbers, grants, vouchers, like the parents? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm not even doing this to save. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  But you will, and it'll cost you much less money. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=475.42s)]
*  You'll get a much better education. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=477.94s)]
*  If you go to some of these states, you'll be the equivalent of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  places that really have a good school system. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=486.62s)]
*  Those places will be the equivalent. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=489.62s)]
*  And your overall numbers will get so much better. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=491.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you want standards associated with... [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=494.1s)]
*  The only thing I want to do from Washington, D.C., is make sure they're teaching English, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=497.46000000000004s)]
*  reading, writing, and arithmetic. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=502.82s)]
*  Science? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=505.38s)]
*  Science? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=506.38s)]
*  Science might help. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=507.38s)]
*  You're not going to have much of a problem with that, but that's it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=508.38s)]
*  So your task now, and I pray to God this is successful, I really do, I wish you Godspeed. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=511.58s)]
*  Godspeed John Glenn. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=519.22s)]
*  It's going to be, by the way. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=520.22s)]
*  I really believe it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=521.6999999999999s)]
*  But there are legitimate areas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=522.6999999999999s)]
*  Because the country's going to do well beside this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  This is cutting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=525.9s)]
*  We're only talking about cutting. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=526.9s)]
*  We're also going to make a lot of money. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  We're taking in so much money. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=530.42s)]
*  What about his business? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=531.42s)]
*  If there is a contract he would otherwise get... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  We're not going to let him do it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=536.0999999999999s)]
*  If he's got a conflict. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=537.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, he's in certain areas. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=538.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I see this morning, I didn't know if I should do the right thing, where they're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=540.66s)]
*  cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=549.86s)]
*  They're cutting back. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=550.86s)]
*  You're losing it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=551.86s)]
*  Not only cutting back. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=552.86s)]
*  Weren't you? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=553.86s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=554.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=555.86s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't tell you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=556.86s)]
*  Well, he's probably not that happy with it, but that would have been one thing he would [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=557.86s)]
*  have come to me and said, listen, you've got to do me a favor. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=561.3s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=563.7s)]
*  But this was in the tax bill. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  They're cutting back on the subsidies. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=566.86s)]
*  I wasn't involved in it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=569.18s)]
*  I said, do what's right, and you get... [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=570.7s)]
*  And they're coming up with a tax bill. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=573.74s)]
*  It's just preliminary. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=574.98s)]
*  But, I mean, if he were involved, wouldn't you think he'd probably do that? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=575.98s)]
*  Now, maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=580.66s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=583.18s)]
*  Because he figures, he does think differently. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=584.18s)]
*  He thinks he has a better product. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=586.22s)]
*  And as long as he has a level playing field, he doesn't care what you do. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=588.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=592.0999999999999s)]
*  He's told me that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=593.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I haven't asked the president for anything ever. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=595.0999999999999s)]
*  And if it comes up, how will you handle it? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=596.0999999999999s)]
*  Well... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=598.3s)]
*  He won't be involved. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=599.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=600.3s)]
*  I'll recuse myself if it is not likely. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=601.3s)]
*  If there's a conflict, he won't be involved. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=602.78s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't want that, and he won't want it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=606.8199999999999s)]
*  And also, I'm getting sort of a daily proctology exam here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=607.8199999999999s)]

*  Welcome to D.C. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=613.42s)]
*  If you want a friend, get a dog. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=614.42s)]

*  I need to bring him to D.C. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=623.62s)]
*  He's... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=624.62s)]
*  I know every businessman. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=625.62s)]

*  than a technologist. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aao0bl7RlKo&t=640.4599999999999s)]
