# Sean Hannity: You deserve better than this
**Fox News:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA)
*  All right, welcome to this special edition of Hannity Election Countdown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark your calendars, because the 2024 presidential election is only 88 days away, and in 39 days, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  early voting officially kicks off in Pennsylvania, rolls out around the country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=13.6s)]
*  Buckle up, because the next three months, well, it's going to be insane. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=17.88s)]
*  It'll be an emotional roller coaster. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=21.72s)]
*  Anyway, President Trump already has survived an assassination attempt. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=24.28s)]
*  Trump also has emerged unscathed from a multi-pronged effort from the left to throw him in jail. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=28.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, Democrats are now on their second ticket, after realizing the Biden-Harris [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=34.68s)]
*  administration failed all of you dramatically, and they were not capable of winning a second [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=39.92s)]
*  term. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  But instead of nominating someone new, they just simply anointed the most unpopular vice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  president in history and in the history of polling, a person who was routinely mocked [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=51.88s)]
*  on both sides of the aisle for being incompetent, unlikable and fake. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=56.92s)]
*  You decide. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=61.72s)]
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=62.72s)]
*  Every day it is time for us to agree. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=73.64s)]
*  You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=76.64s)]
*  The significance of the passage of time, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=85.12s)]
*  The significance of the passage of time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=88.12s)]
*  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=91.08s)]
*  A movement that has always been about the ability to see what can be unburdened by what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=95.44s)]
*  has been. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=101.52s)]
*  We have seen what can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=103.44s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=110.44s)]
*  Ukraine is a country in Europe. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=115.12s)]
*  It exists next to another country called Russia. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Russia is a bigger country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=122.72s)]
*  Russia is a powerful country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=126.16s)]
*  So basically that's wrong. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=130.04s)]
*  What can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=134.2s)]
*  No wonder she reads the same exact speech every single campaign event, pretty much word [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=137.76s)]
*  for word. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=142.72s)]
*  Now her campaign is simply terrified to let her go off script and for good reason. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=143.88s)]
*  The more people hear from the real Kamala Harris and the more they get to know her, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=148.28s)]
*  the less likely she is to get elected. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=152.72s)]
*  So she, with the help of the state-run media, proved a mob. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=155.12s)]
*  They're hiding her in the basement, like they did Joe in 2020 or pretty much their version [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=159.28s)]
*  of it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=165.36s)]
*  Now that's why Kamala Harris almost never speaks without a teleprompter and almost never [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=166.36s)]
*  gives a speech that is different. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=170.52s)]
*  It's the same words, same speech over and over again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=174.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=178.72s)]
*  Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=179.72s)]
*  It really is good to be back in Wisconsin. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=182.72s)]
*  It is so good to be back in Michigan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=185.72s)]
*  I am clear. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=188.24s)]
*  The path to the White House runs right through this state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=189.4s)]
*  And listen, I am clear. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  The path to the White House runs right through this state. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=194.28s)]
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=198.28s)]
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  I know Donald Trump's type. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=207.64s)]
*  I know Donald Trump's type. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=212.0s)]
*  In this campaign, I proudly put my record against his any day of the week. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=214.88s)]
*  In this campaign, I proudly put my record against his any day of the week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=221.96s)]
*  Are you ready to make your voices heard? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=228.8s)]
*  Ready to make your voices heard? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Are you ready to make your voices heard? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  When we fight, we win! [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  And I know Kamala's type. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=240.36s)]
*  Radical, extreme, and her policies are downright dangerous. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Since the coronation, there have been zero official press conferences, zero national [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=245.84s)]
*  interviews. In fact, she has not participated in an official presser since [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=250.44s)]
*  December last year, and that went on for a whopping 12 minutes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=255.28s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi once urged her colleagues to pass a bill so they can find out what's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  in the bill. Now, Democrats, they're asking you, the American people, to vote for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=263.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris so you can find out what she really believes, according to The New [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=268.64s)]
*  Yorker. Quote, Harris's campaign website, meanwhile, does not have a policy section [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=273.72s)]
*  or an articulation of beliefs. There's just a button to donate some merch and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  yard signs and a biography. Now, naturally, her biography does not make any mention of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Kamala's prior positions that she's had on issues like her ban on fracking and oil [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  exploration and her plan to defund, dismantle the police, no bail laws, or her [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  support for that bail fund after a police precinct was burned to the ground four [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  days later, four days after the burning, or her plan to abolish ICE or her plan to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=307.52s)]
*  decriminalize illegal immigration and give illegal immigrants free health care, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=312.64s)]
*  housing, education, or her plan to have a mandatory gun buyback program to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=317.88s)]
*  confiscate your guns, or her plan to eliminate the filibuster so she can pass [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=323.52s)]
*  the whopping $93 trillion socialist green new deal. And according to random [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=328.88s)]
*  campaign staffers, though, Kamala's a new woman. Well, whose views suddenly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=334.68s)]
*  changed on everything. They changed as soon as she was anointed, anointed the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=339.68s)]
*  Democratic nominee without a single vote, and they disenfranchised every [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=344.48s)]
*  Democratic primary voter in the country. But, of course, we're yet to hear from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=348.52s)]
*  Kamala herself, so we really don't know about any of these issues. Did she change [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=353.32s)]
*  her mind on fracking? Did she change her mind on mandatory gun buybacks? You know, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=357.76s)]
*  these issues, however, this week Kamala did promise to bring prices down on day [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=363.12s)]
*  one. Inflation she's going to deal with on day one if she's elected. Is she [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=368.0s)]
*  forgetting something? You decide. Prices for everyday things like groceries are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=373.76s)]
*  still too high. You know it and I know it. You know, when I was Attorney General I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=379.36s)]
*  went after price fixing schemes, and when I am president it will be a day one [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=384.74s)]
*  priority to fight to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=391.24s)]
*  engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=397.16s)]
*  working families. I will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  drugs for all Americans. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=410.36s)]
*  Day one. Gonna take this on. Kamala, you're in office [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=414.16s)]
*  right now. You're the vice president of the country. You were elected four years ago and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  every single month under your administration prices have gone up and up and up and up and up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=425.68s)]
*  Every item, every American buys and every store they go to, up up up. Of all people, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=431.92s)]
*  you should understand the significance of the passage of four years of time. And during the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=437.2s)]
*  past three plus years gas prices, yep, they're up a whopping amount as well as our housing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=443.68s)]
*  prices, as our food costs. They're going through the roof. Credit card debt, nearly $7,000 per [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=450.48s)]
*  American. This is insane. And keep in mind the most significant component of inflation is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=457.92s)]
*  government spending. Yeah, that keeps going up a whopping $2 trillion a year. Here are just a few [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=463.6s)]
*  examples of how Kamala spent your money. Now, first we have $5 billion for an electric school [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  bus program that has managed to produce 60 buses. That's $83 million per bus produced. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=475.36s)]
*  And let's not forget the $7.5 billion investment, they always say investment, in electric vehicle [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=482.32s)]
*  charging stations that produced only seven stations in two years. Wow, that's the government. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=488.72s)]
*  And she wants to get rid of your own private healthcare insurance. As legend has it, Kamala [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=495.04s)]
*  still trying to figure out how these charging stations work. It didn't work out when she tried [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=500.16s)]
*  it the last time. Take a look. That's it. Yeah. There we are. That's it. And there's no sound or [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=505.36s)]
*  a few. There is nothing. Yeah. And that's all there is to it. Well, for all of us who are used to filling our tank, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=515.28s)]
*  we usually can smell it and you can hear it. You can hear the guzzling sound. Right. None of that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  So how do I know it's actually working? It is. So typically once you wave the card, it's actually [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=528.64s)]
*  charging. So that's how I know that. So typically, excuse me. Yes. So typically you come in here [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=536.88s)]
*  wave this card and then what we would do is we would authenticate and then the light comes green. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=545.28s)]
*  So you look at the green wire. So that's how it's charging. Absolutely. Has anyone ever told Kamala [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=552.4s)]
*  90% of the electric grid is fossil fuel based? Has anyone ever told her that to get the batteries [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=557.36s)]
*  to build an electric car, you got to pillage mother earth and get the cobalt and the nickel [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=564.64s)]
*  and the manganese and all those other minerals and that studies have shown that electric cars [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=570.4s)]
*  are heavier and more dangerous to other drivers? Americans can't afford four more years of Kamala [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=576.56s)]
*  Harris. She picked a running mate, meanwhile, who doesn't even understand basic economics 101, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=583.76s)]
*  not even on a personal level. Tim Walz, it turns out he has no stocks, no bonds, no 401k. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=589.12s)]
*  By the way, first thing I say to somebody when I hire them, make sure you invest in your 401k. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=595.6s)]
*  No real estate. He doesn't have a mortgage. He doesn't even own a house. He has never started a [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=600.72s)]
*  business, well worked in the private sector and Democrats think this guy should be a heartbeat [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=606.32s)]
*  away from the presidency, the second in command of the country with the largest economy in the world, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=611.92s)]
*  but it gets worse on issues from defunding, dismantling the police, no bail laws, open borders, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=617.6s)]
*  free healthcare, universal healthcare system and free healthcare for illegal immigrants, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=623.6s)]
*  free education, driver's licenses is for illegals. Walz is as radical as he gets. Walz is nuts. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=629.44s)]
*  As governor, he even let neighborhoods in Minneapolis simply burn to the ground and do [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=636.72s)]
*  nothing in the summer of 2020, waiting five whole days before sending in the national guard. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=641.2s)]
*  His family wanted to breathe in the air and the smell of burning rubber. And according to a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=647.28s)]
*  Minnesota Senate report, as Minneapolis was burning, well, these were the questions that Walz's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=652.64s)]
*  staff were posing to the guard before sending them in. Any diversity and inclusion training, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=658.8s)]
*  any experience working with diverse communities, what communities will they be coming from? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=665.12s)]
*  Walz was putting DEI ahead of safety and security as the city of Minneapolis is burning [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=670.56s)]
*  and a police precinct is burned to the ground that a target is ransacked. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=678.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, his advocacy for child sex change, well, that's pretty creepy and dangerous. He's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=683.04s)]
*  also known, well, famously now on X as Tampon Tim. Why? Because he all but forced schools to put [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=688.2399999999999s)]
*  women's, well, menstrual products in boys' bathrooms by removing gendered language from [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=694.96s)]
*  a state mandate. Yeah, he did it. But Walz's radical track record doesn't end there. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=701.12s)]
*  According to a report from the Washington Examiner, get this, Governor Walz repeatedly [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  hosted a radical Muslim cleric who actually celebrated the October 7th terror attack, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=711.36s)]
*  pushed bizarre anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and even posted a link to a pro-Hitler film called [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=717.52s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, The Greatest Story Never Told. So does Walz condone this kind of rhetoric? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=724.4s)]
*  Kind of hard to say because like Harris, Walz is not answering questions. He's not holding press [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=730.48s)]
*  conferences. He's not doing a gaggle. You deserve better. It's that simple, especially after a little [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=736.4s)]
*  switcheroo. They should be forced to answer questions. But your corrupt state-run media [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=744.48s)]
*  mob is giving them a pass like they did Joe in 2020, and especially now that Walz is being [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=750.88s)]
*  accused of stolen valor by the very people that served with him in the National Guard. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=757.84s)]
*  It appears that Walz embellished his rank, has repeatedly bragged about a deployment to a combat [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=764.16s)]
*  zone with a gun. Never happened. Walz retired from the Guard just before his platoon was set to deploy [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=770.48s)]
*  to Iraq in 2004. CBS anchor Dan Rather, remember, he tried to sing George W. Bush's re-election [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=778.0s)]
*  with a fake story about Bush's service in the Air National Guard. The media went wild with that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=785.44s)]
*  story. Why aren't they going wild here with stolen valor and literally telling people something about [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=792.32s)]
*  his record that is false in terms of his rank when he retired that made him look better? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=799.76s)]
*  Now in the Bush case, well, the documents, by the way, turned out to be fake. Now during a very real [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=806.8s)]
*  scandal with eyewitness accounts, the media mob, well, they're going to let Walz off the hook. He's [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=812.7199999999999s)]
*  a Democrat and he's running against Donald Trump. It's that simple. Journalism, I said it in 07 and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=817.6s)]
*  08, it is dead in this country. And now it is dangerous. We have an information crisis. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=823.36s)]
*  You deserve to know that the past four years have been a train wreck, and this is the most radical, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=829.12s)]
*  extreme, dangerous major party ticket ever to run for the White House. And it's just sad and it's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=834.4s)]
*  pathetic, you know, when they try to, people try to buy a house or, you know, fill up their cars or [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=841.12s)]
*  look at their credit card statement. Well, guess what? You're feeling the impact of their policies [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  that will get much worse with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=850.56s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyx0WKq8cDA&t=864.4s)]
