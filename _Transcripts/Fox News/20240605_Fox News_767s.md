# Donald Trump on facing jail time: 'I am very proud to fight for our Constitution'
**Fox News:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg)
*  We just have breaking news, as I mentioned in my open tonight, and I want to get your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=0.0s)]
*  reaction to the fact that the appeals court has now stopped your Georgia case, election [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=4.96s)]
*  case, while appeal on Willis's disqualification is pending. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=9.72s)]
*  This is on the heels of Florida Judge Eileen Cannon looking into whether or not the prosecutor, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=14.44s)]
*  Jack Smith, the special prosecutor, was pointed in an inappropriate way, which would render [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=22.56s)]
*  the case and the indictments out completely. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=28.6s)]
*  That is going to take place in fairly short order. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  A law can change in a couple of days with only 152 days out of election. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=34.04s)]
*  And what we call deranged Jack Smith, because you look at his career, he's been overturned [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=39.2s)]
*  by the Supreme Court unanimously. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=43.300000000000004s)]
*  So many other things. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=45.16s)]
*  He goes too far. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=46.72s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=47.72s)]
*  You had said something during the trial in New York. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=48.72s)]
*  Mother Teresa couldn't beat these charges was one thing that you said, and you turned [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  out to be right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=56.34s)]
*  Secondly, you were asked about the possibility that Judge Mershon might send you to jail. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=59.28s)]
*  You said something that really kind of got my attention. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=67.32s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=71.88s)]
*  That it didn't phase you in the sense that if that's what it takes, you don't have to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=72.88s)]
*  be doing this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=77.36s)]
*  You could be playing golf every day, and you probably wouldn't be charged with anything. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=78.36s)]
*  Well, I think I say it about almost all of these cases that are brought against me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=81.28s)]
*  They are doing it for the purposes of hurting a political opponent of Biden and trying to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  get him to win. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=90.3s)]
*  And he's the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=91.3s)]
*  But in the case that you're talking about, I said very strongly that I'm very proud to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=93.82s)]
*  fight for our Constitution. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=98.3s)]
*  And if that's what it takes, everybody said, this is such a minor thing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=99.94s)]
*  You don't go to jail for this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  All of them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=107.13999999999999s)]
*  But you don't understand what we're dealing against, Sean. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=108.13999999999999s)]
*  We're dealing against a system that is so corrupt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=110.1s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=115.3s)]
*  I did nothing wrong in any of these things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=116.98s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=119.74s)]
*  We did nothing wrong at all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=120.94s)]
*  And whether you look at the analysts, whether it's Greg Jarrett or Andy McCarthy or Jonathan [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  Turley or your friend, the great one, Mark Levin, Dershowitz, all of them, they said [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=130.22s)]
*  there's no case here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=136.62s)]
*  Judge Jeanine was so incredible two weeks ago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=137.62s)]
*  She was unbelievable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=141.22s)]
*  Angry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=142.22s)]
*  She was angry. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=143.22s)]
*  And you know why they're angry? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  Because they love our country and they see what's happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  It's totally unconstitutional what they've done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  And if you look at the statements made by the people I just mentioned, and I'm not friends [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=149.78s)]
*  with any, I mean, I think they respect what I've done. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=155.62s)]
*  They might respect me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=158.0s)]
*  They might not respect me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  But they said there's no case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't have been brought. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=162.82s)]
*  And the way the judge charged the jury, told the jury, gave jury instructions, nobody's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=164.22s)]
*  ever heard anything like that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=169.44s)]
*  It was basically when you break it down, a records-keeping issue on a misdemeanor whose [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=170.94s)]
*  statuette of limitations had run out, that they upcharged into a felony on a federal [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=175.22s)]
*  election and that raises another issue of appeal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=180.42s)]
*  What will be your appeal? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=183.22s)]
*  By the way, when you say records-keeping, you know what the record-keeping was? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=184.22s)]
*  They charged an election, if you look, a lawyer's fee, a legal fee, and you call it a legal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  expense. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=196.82s)]
*  It's known. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=197.82s)]
*  You call a legal fee a legal expense. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=198.82s)]
*  The bookkeeper I never spoke to correctly wrote a legal expense for a lawyer that was paid. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=199.9s)]
*  We have a similar case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  Hillary Clinton funneled money to a law firm, and that law firm hired an op research firm. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=207.5s)]
*  And that op research firm hired a guy by Christopher Steele. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=212.66s)]
*  That became the basis of what I described as the dirty Russian misinformation dossier. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=215.82s)]
*  That became the basis of not one, but four FISA applications. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  And it all turned out not to be true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=225.1s)]
*  In that case, nobody was charged. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Nobody was charged with top secret classified information. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=231.7s)]
*  Our home wasn't rated on our server. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=234.54s)]
*  Deleted subpoenaed emails, 30,000 of them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=237.26s)]
*  We didn't hear a bleach bit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  Then you have all the people that signed off on those warrants. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=241.98s)]
*  Nothing happens to them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=244.77999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden, four locations, top secret documents. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=245.98s)]
*  Nobody rated his house. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=249.5s)]
*  That I guess we've added a new word to our lexicon. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  And that is lawfare or weaponization of justice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=255.94s)]
*  My question to you is, and people are saying, actually because of an interview we did together, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=260.9s)]
*  you said I would be dictator for the day and just to secure the border and drill for oil. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=267.02s)]
*  I thought it was tongue in cheek. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=272.86s)]
*  I was sitting there with you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=274.42s)]
*  However, my question is a very serious one. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=276.3s)]
*  People are claiming you want retribution. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=280.86s)]
*  People are claiming you want what has happened to you done to Democrats. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=284.06s)]
*  Would you do that ever? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  Look, what's happened to me has never happened in this country before. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  And it has to stop because... [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=293.58s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=295.14s)]
*  I want to hear that again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=296.14s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=297.26s)]
*  Well, it does have to stop because we're not going to have a country... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=298.26s)]
*  And if you're elected, what does that mean? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=300.94s)]
*  Define that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=303.06s)]
*  Look, what I've gone through, nobody's ever gone through. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=304.06s)]
*  I'm a very legitimate person. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=308.9s)]
*  I built a great business. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  Everything's been... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=312.82s)]
*  I have been under siege. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=313.82s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like this in this country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=316.06s)]
*  Now, in other countries, in other third world countries, who are banana republic, as they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=318.74s)]
*  say, a banana republic, we've become a banana republic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=324.98s)]
*  At the border, we've become a banana republic. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  With so many other elements of our country, we've become a banana republic. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=331.38s)]
*  You take a look at what's happening with inflation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=334.94s)]
*  That's a banana republic inflation, what we have. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=337.78s)]
*  I think it could be as high as 50% if you add everything in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  When you start adding energy prices in, when you start adding interest rates, which have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=343.94s)]
*  gone from 2% to 9% and 10%. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  But focus on those that want people to believe that you want retribution, that you will use [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=351.7s)]
*  the system of justice to go after your political enemies. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=359.86s)]
*  So, number one, they're wrong. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=363.1s)]
*  It has to stop because otherwise we're not going to have a country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=364.66s)]
*  When this election is over, based on what they've done, I would have every right to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=368.14s)]
*  go after them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=375.14s)]
*  And it's easy because it's Joe Biden. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=376.7s)]
*  And you see all the criminality, all of the money that's going into the family and him, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=379.06s)]
*  all of this money from China, from Russia, from Ukraine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=384.82s)]
*  During one of the interviews, I said, what about the $3.5 million paid to the Biden family [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=388.78s)]
*  from the mayor of Moscow's wife? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=394.38s)]
*  What about that? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=397.14000000000004s)]
*  And Chris Wallace defended him, said, you can't ask that question. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, then it turned out to be a big deal long after that debate. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  That was one of the debates. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=404.66s)]
*  And it turned out to be a big deal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  And Chris Wallace said, we can't go there because we don't know that it should turn [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=407.62s)]
*  out to be true. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=411.3s)]
*  Millions and millions of dollars. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  Now, if we're going to do that... [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  He had dinner with her at the Cafe Milano. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  And he said to America he never once talked to his son, brother, or anybody about their [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=418.3s)]
*  foreign business deal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=422.94s)]
*  Well, he said it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=423.94s)]
*  And then you found out it was absolutely untrue. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=424.98s)]
*  Everything he says is untrue. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=427.82s)]
*  There's never been a president like this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=429.74s)]
*  Look, he is a horrible president. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=431.66s)]
*  He's destroying our country at the border. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=433.78s)]
*  He's allowing millions of people to come in from prisons and jails, from mental institutions [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=436.06s)]
*  and insane asylums, which is a step above, a big step above a mental institution. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=441.06s)]
*  He's allowing terrorists to flood into our country. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=447.42s)]
*  And the numbers are probably 16, 17 or 18 million people. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=450.42s)]
*  He's going to have over 20 million people, I think, I believe, and a lot of other people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=454.42s)]
*  too, by the time he hopefully gets out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=458.62s)]
*  November 5 election day will be the most... [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, it starts on September 22nd. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  It starts earlier because of early voting. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  But November 5th will go down as the most important election in the history of our country. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=469.66s)]
*  It's going to be the most important day and period in the history of our country. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=476.1s)]
*  Will you pledge to restore equal justice, equal application of our laws, end this practice [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=480.94s)]
*  of weaponization? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=489.86s)]
*  Is that a promise you're going to make? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=491.62s)]
*  You have to do it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=492.62s)]
*  But it's awful. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=494.26s)]
*  Look, I know you want me to say something so... [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=495.26s)]
*  No, I don't want you to say it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=497.54s)]
*  I'm asking. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=498.54s)]
*  But I don't want to look naive. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=499.54s)]
*  I don't want to... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=500.54s)]
*  What they've done to the Republican Party, they want to arrest on no crime, they want [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=501.54s)]
*  the person that won the nomination in a landslide. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=508.42s)]
*  There was nobody even close in a landslide. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=511.74s)]
*  The person that got millions of votes, more votes than any other sitting president in [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=514.9s)]
*  history in the last election. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=519.72s)]
*  The person that won an election that he wasn't expected to win against Hillary Clinton in [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=521.74s)]
*  2016, they want to arrest that person on no crime. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=526.46s)]
*  They want to arrest... [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  There was no criminality. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=533.4200000000001s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  And you can go back to all of these legal scholars. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=535.5s)]
*  They can't believe what's happening. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=538.3000000000001s)]
*  Some of them don't even like me, and they're saying, this is a very, very dangerous thing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  that's happening. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=544.14s)]
*  No, we can't let this happen. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=545.14s)]
*  And I will do everything in my power not to let... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=547.74s)]
*  But there's tremendous criminality here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=551.34s)]
*  What they're doing to me, if it's going to continue, we're really not going to have much [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=553.62s)]
*  of a country left. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=558.4200000000001s)]
*  It's really... [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=559.58s)]
*  It is weaponization. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=560.58s)]
*  You call it lawfare. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=561.58s)]
*  You call it... [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=562.58s)]
*  Some people call it just warfare. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=563.8s)]
*  But it is weaponization of the election. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=565.72s)]
*  And we're talking about, I think, the most important election in the history of our country. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=569.52s)]
*  This will go down, I believe, as the most important election in the history of our country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=574.16s)]
*  We can't have this stuff go on. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=578.74s)]
*  Because you know what? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=580.6s)]
*  When Biden goes out, everyone says bye-bye, and then he gets indicted two days later, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=581.8s)]
*  and they go after him. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=586.64s)]
*  The country doesn't want that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=590.56s)]
*  They didn't want it with Hillary Clinton either. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=591.56s)]
*  I thought it was terrible. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=593.16s)]
*  You know, I'd make a speech everywhere and say, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=594.16s)]
*  And I was at a UFC fight the other night with Dana White, who's fantastic. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=597.64s)]
*  He's at a terrible reception. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=601.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=602.56s)]
*  Well, I'm kidding. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=603.56s)]
*  You better tell them. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=604.56s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=605.56s)]
*  I'm not telling Dana that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=606.56s)]
*  People don't understand. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=607.56s)]
*  Sometimes suck asses. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=608.56s)]
*  We played it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=609.56s)]
*  It was pretty overwhelming. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=610.56s)]
*  It was 25,000 people, whatever they had, going absolutely... [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  Right after your conviction. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=615.4s)]
*  There wasn't a negative... [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=616.4s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=617.4s)]
*  What I watched, and it was very... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=618.4s)]
*  Some of the fighters, two in particular, hated their opponent. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=619.94s)]
*  And this went on for months. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=623.32s)]
*  The fight was broadcast out, and they announced the fight, and the hatred was real. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=624.46s)]
*  It was the real deal. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=631.58s)]
*  These people, they have a lot of hatred, and they hate it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=632.6600000000001s)]
*  And then the fight ended, and they're hugging and kissing in the ring. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=636.2600000000001s)]
*  They're down, sitting on... [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=639.0200000000001s)]
*  They're hugging and kissing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=640.22s)]
*  It's like nothing happened. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=642.5400000000001s)]
*  Happened on two fights. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=644.1400000000001s)]
*  There were tremendous animosity between the two fighters and the other two fighters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=645.1400000000001s)]
*  And at the end, that's what happened. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=649.8599999999999s)]
*  And in a certain way, after we won against Hillary, people would say, lock her up, lock [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=652.6999999999999s)]
*  her up. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=657.92s)]
*  And I said, wouldn't it be terrible if I locked up the wife of the president of the United [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=658.92s)]
*  States former and locked up the former secretary of state? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=665.24s)]
*  It's a terrible thing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=671.38s)]
*  You're starting off, you want to bring the country together. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=672.38s)]
*  I want to bring the country together. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=674.16s)]
*  And success does bring the country together because we had the most successful economy [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=676.2s)]
*  in the history of our country just prior to COVID. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=680.12s)]
*  And even at the end, I got it back. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=683.2s)]
*  It was an amazing thing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=685.0s)]
*  But we had the most successful economy in history. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=686.52s)]
*  And I was getting calls from radical left people wanting to meet. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=689.72s)]
*  And I'm telling you, success. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=693.28s)]
*  African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, women, men, people with diplomas, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=695.4s)]
*  people without diplomas, people that went to MIT, Harvard, and Wharton, people that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=700.32s)]
*  didn't get out of high school. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=704.12s)]
*  The most successful economy we've ever had. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=706.92s)]
*  And people that I would say you call them on the radical left, call it whatever you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=711.0s)]
*  want, liberal people, progressive people. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  They were all calling and they were saying, let's get together. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=718.0999999999999s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=721.68s)]
*  Nobody know every single group. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=723.92s)]
*  Nobody has ever done better than during that period of time in my administration during [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  that period. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=730.48s)]
*  And they wanted to get together. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=732.16s)]
*  And it would have happened. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=734.72s)]
*  We would have happened. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=736.16s)]
*  It was really something. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=737.16s)]
*  I'm not sure I would have been able to say to you that there was a way to unify. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=738.8s)]
*  Success will unify. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=743.86s)]
*  And I think we're going to have a tremendous success. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=744.96s)]
*  We have to bring it back fast because this country is, we're a failing nation. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=746.9s)]
*  We are really a failing nation right now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=750.78s)]
*  We're being laughed at all over the world. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=752.48s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bitGAOz0kg&t=762.12s)]
