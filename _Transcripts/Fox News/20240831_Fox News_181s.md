# Alina Habba: They are so afraid of Trump, they will stop at nothing
**Fox News:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just weeks before his sentencing in New York, Trump has asked a federal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=5.2s)]
*  court to take over Bragg's falsified business documents case in the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=9.48s)]
*  empire state. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=14.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are already buzzing about a potential replacement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=15.4s)]
*  for Garland. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=19.12s)]
*  Should Kamala win in November? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=20.28s)]
*  Getting a little ahead of their skis there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=22.36s)]
*  Would she continue to weaponize our justice system against Trump? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=25.44s)]
*  Here with reaction, Trump campaign senior advisor, Alina Habba. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=29.44s)]
*  Alina, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=33.52s)]
*  Alik, you've been the tip of the spear on many of these issues. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=35.52s)]
*  I don't see any slowdown by Kamala Harris in weaponizing the Department of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=40.04s)]
*  Justice to go after Trump and his family. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=45.36s)]
*  But what, what, how do you see it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=47.88s)]
*  Oh, it's obvious that this has been their MO and I want to personally thank them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=52.36s)]
*  It's also been part of our, our election integrity and interference [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=57.24s)]
*  storyline here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=63.6s)]
*  These people don't realize what they're doing is only rallying Americans that see [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=65.04s)]
*  that they're turning President Trump into something that he is not because they are [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=68.68s)]
*  so afraid that he will win because they can't. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=72.84s)]
*  The American people are not stupid. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=75.68s)]
*  We've talked about this off the cuff, you know, at the RNC. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=77.16s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=80.16s)]
*  They will not stop at anything. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=83.36s)]
*  They are so afraid of Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=84.84s)]
*  They are so afraid that they will keep going. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=86.32s)]
*  And Jack Smith in particular has not stopped. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=88.56s)]
*  And now what we're asking the court to do in the hush money case, as it's called, is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  another rigged trial that never should have happened. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=95.52s)]
*  But then the Supreme Court said it shouldn't have happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=97.8s)]
*  And we're now saying, look, you won't recuse yourself. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=101.32s)]
*  You will not get rid of all these sham cases like you should. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=104.32s)]
*  So now we're going to ask you not a first time, but a second time to remove this to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  federal court judges where we have dignity, where we have civility and we have due process. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=112.2s)]
*  And let us have faith in the American system again. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=116.96s)]
*  They will stop at nothing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  That's the truth, Jason. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=121.2s)]
*  They're desperate. They know that these policies are going to come out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=122.24s)]
*  Right now, there's a little honeymoon stage happening. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  It will stop because the minute President Trump starts speaking about his policies that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=127.44s)]
*  are winner policies, the whole honeymoon is over. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=131.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the distraction they try to say. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=135.68s)]
*  Oh, things are going well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=138.32s)]
*  Let's go over and try to distract people and scare people who maybe don't watch [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=139.64s)]
*  campaigns and elections 24 seven, like a lot of people do. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=144.2s)]
*  Alina, I could spend an hour chatting with you, but I can't right now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=148.2s)]
*  But what I do would encourage people do is go visit my podcast. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=151.6s)]
*  It's Jason in the House. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=156.0s)]
*  I have a podcast up where Alina and I get to spend, gosh, 30, 40 minutes talking about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=157.72s)]
*  the issues. Just type in Jason in the House. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Wherever you listen to podcasts and you hear a lot more from Alina there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im-5YH5slWQ&t=164.88s)]
