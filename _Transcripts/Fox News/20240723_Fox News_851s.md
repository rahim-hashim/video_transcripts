# Hannity: This was a coup inside the Democratic Party
**Fox News:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0)
*  And welcome to Hannity and breaking tonight's shocking new body cam video from the assassination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=0.0s)]
*  attempt against Donald Trump, as the head of the Secret Service has finally, I mean, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  finally tendered her resignation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=12.06s)]
*  We have a lot more coming up in just a moment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=13.94s)]
*  But tonight, we have good news to report. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=16.66s)]
*  The president of the United States, Joe Biden, is definitely alive, pictured here, walking [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  to Air Force One. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=24.48s)]
*  He didn't even have to be surrounded. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=25.48s)]
*  It looked like he might have used the big boy's stairs and everything earlier this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=27.42s)]
*  morning, but for days, the president was nowhere to be seen or heard, except on X, causing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=31.32s)]
*  rumors and speculation, not on this program, to run wild. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=37.42s)]
*  Now, Biden didn't even publicly announce his decision to drop out of the 2024 race [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=41.300000000000004s)]
*  or his decision to endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=47.3s)]
*  So there were no videos, no pictures, nothing, just a brief statement on X. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=50.1s)]
*  I guess that's the way we now communicate with each other. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=55.66s)]
*  Anyway, the White House said that Biden was under the weather. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=58.46s)]
*  He had COVID. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  Apparently, he's feeling better. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  I'm glad to hear it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  According to reports, Biden spent the weekend fuming at the elites in his own party. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=64.5s)]
*  Now, apparently, according to The New York Post, other sources, Joe's decision to drop [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=70.46s)]
*  out was, in fact, coerced. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=75.18s)]
*  One top Democrat telling Politico, quote, Nancy Pelosi made it very clear that Biden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=78.14s)]
*  could do it the easy way or the hard way. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=83.78s)]
*  Sounds like the mop. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=86.58s)]
*  Anyway, he continued, quote, She gave his three weeks of the easy way. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=87.94s)]
*  It was about to be the hard way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=93.78s)]
*  There is even speculation that Pelosi and others were threatening to trigger the 25th [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=96.34s)]
*  Amendment and remove Biden from office if he did not comply to the elites in his party. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=100.86s)]
*  And so much for Pelosi's lie on MSDNC. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=107.34s)]
*  She supports whatever decision he makes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=110.7s)]
*  Make no mistake, this was a coup inside the Democratic Party. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=113.7s)]
*  The millions of primary votes around the country for Joe Biden have been flushed down the toilet, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=118.54s)]
*  rendered meaningless, completely disenfranchised by Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=124.78s)]
*  other D.C., Hollywood big donor elites, the same Democratic overlords, then unilaterally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=131.22s)]
*  selected Joe's replacement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=137.34s)]
*  And that's Kamala Harris, at least as of tonight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=139.42s)]
*  Now, tonight also, the Democratic Party, you need to understand what's happening here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=141.94s)]
*  This is Kamala's honeymoon period. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=147.42s)]
*  She is experiencing a sugar high, a feeling of relief and enthusiasm that the guy that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=150.34s)]
*  can't walk and talk, that's dazed and confused, the guy that mumbles and bumbles and stumbles, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=157.7s)]
*  oh, thank God it's not him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=163.14s)]
*  It's a honeymoon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=165.9s)]
*  It's a sugar high. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=167.38s)]
*  Mark my words, it will be short-lived. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=168.78s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to start the process of reintroducing you to the real Kamala Harris. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=172.38s)]
*  We will, as usual, do the state-run media mob's job. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=179.18s)]
*  We will vet the new presidential candidate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=182.58s)]
*  We will do it thoroughly, while so-called journalists, they will be swooning over their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=184.74s)]
*  new presidential candidate while they cheer and they applaud. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=190.46s)]
*  We'll actually tell you the full truth about the now soon-to-be Democratic nominee. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=194.61999999999998s)]
*  This is, let me put it this way, the most radical vice president, soon-to-be presidential [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=200.98s)]
*  candidate in history. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=207.22s)]
*  We will point out her radical positions on Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=209.72s)]
*  She won't be meeting Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  We'll expose her support for far-left violent rioting and insurrection and her attempts [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=216.5s)]
*  to completely upend law and order in this country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=223.38000000000002s)]
*  We will review her love of socialism, her love of the Green New Deal she co-sponsored, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=227.5s)]
*  her love of single-payer healthcare, her love of an 80 percent tax rate that she said would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=232.5s)]
*  be fantastic, and we'll also even discuss her past support for Jussie Smollett. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=238.5s)]
*  Remember that case? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=244.86s)]
*  Kamala referred affectionately to that case as a victim of a modern-day lynching. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=246.18s)]
*  But first, here's Chuck Schumer offering his very, very late but enthusiastic support [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=251.54s)]
*  for his party's brand-new nominee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=257.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=259.86s)]
*  So now that the process has played out from the grassroots bottom up, we are here today [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=260.86s)]
*  to throw our support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=267.96s)]
*  I'm clapping. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=273.34s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=274.34s)]
*  It's a happy day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=275.34s)]
*  What can I say? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=279.74s)]
*  Vice President Harris will beat Donald Trump and become the next president of the United [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=281.06s)]
*  States of America. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=286.3s)]
*  Applause. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=289.3s)]
*  Hakeem. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=290.3s)]
*  Wow, the enthusiasm is through the roof and not fake at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=291.3s)]
*  And by the way, did Chuck Schumer say that the process played out from the grassroots [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=297.26s)]
*  bottom up? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=301.94s)]
*  Chucky. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=303.22s)]
*  Kamala did not get a single primary vote, not one. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=304.7s)]
*  You was picked by party elites, people like yourself, Chuck, without any input, zero input, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  no consideration at all for the voters. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=314.38s)]
*  You throw these—you literally help throw those votes in the garbage. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=317.66s)]
*  People went to the polls for no reason at all. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=321.98s)]
*  My humble advice to the democracy-loving Democrats, it might be a good idea to consult with the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=324.62s)]
*  people in your party before making such a big decision. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=330.86s)]
*  Well, as of now, Kamala is now polling even worse than Joe Biden. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=335.46s)]
*  Recent Harris polls has Trump beating Harris by nine points nationwide, and a preliminary [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=339.05999999999995s)]
*  result from a brand-new Rasmussen poll has Trump up by a whopping 13. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=344.46s)]
*  Another poll has Trump up by two. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  That's not all. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=351.26s)]
*  The New York Times put together a list of 10 Democrats. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=352.26s)]
*  The New York Times, they ranked their chances of beating Donald Trump in the fall, and they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=355.02s)]
*  ranked Kamala Harris dead last. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=359.58s)]
*  One columnist for The Times referred to Harris as, quote, a mediocre politician from a deep [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=362.86s)]
*  blue state with low national approval ratings, and one of the key reasons for Kamala's historically [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=367.78s)]
*  low approval, you know, surrounds her role in the Biden administration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=373.42s)]
*  So let's be clear off the top here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=377.98s)]
*  Kamala Harris owns every single one of the Biden-Harris policy failure, all of them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=380.62s)]
*  But it's especially true at the southern border, because in 2021, Kamala was appointed [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=388.2s)]
*  a, quote, border czar, and from the outset she pledged to address the root causes of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=393.28s)]
*  illegal immigration and put an end to the crisis. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=399.08s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=402.28s)]
*  And by the way, Kamala did next to nothing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=403.28s)]
*  The border crisis exploded. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=406.14s)]
*  It has become the single biggest national security threat in our lifetime. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=408.2s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=412.18s)]
*  Illegal immigration is now 10 times worse under Kamala's, quote, so-called leadership. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=413.34s)]
*  More unvetted Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, illegal immigrants have poured across this border [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=418.82s)]
*  than the entire population of New York City. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=424.56s)]
*  There are 40 U.S. states with a smaller population than the influx of illegals under Biden and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=427.73999999999995s)]
*  Harris. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=433.9s)]
*  The cost to all of you, every taxpayer, is astronomical. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=434.9s)]
*  The risk of terrorism and crime is unthinkable. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=440.34s)]
*  It's never been higher, according to Director Wray of the FBI. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=443.34s)]
*  Murders, rapes have occurred as a result of their open borders. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=447.34s)]
*  The odds of a 9-11 terror attack, again, in the words of Director Wray, have never been [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=451.64s)]
*  greater. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=458.14s)]
*  Joe and Kamala, let me be very, very clear. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=459.14s)]
*  Kamala, like Joe, you have blood on your hands. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=462.34s)]
*  And yet, for a while, Kamala couldn't even be bothered to visit the border. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=466.56s)]
*  You might recall. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=470.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=471.68s)]
*  The notion that the border is closed, why should they believe you when they know that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=472.68s)]
*  people are getting in? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=477.72s)]
*  Well, Lester, here's the thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=478.72s)]
*  I've been working on this issue for a very long time. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any plans to visit the border? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=484.72s)]
*  I'm here in Guatemala today at some point. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=488.44s)]
*  We are going to the border. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=494.68s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=495.8s)]
*  So, this whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=496.8s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=501.96s)]
*  You haven't been to the border. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=502.96s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=505.16s)]
*  And I mean, I don't understand the point that you're making. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=506.16s)]
*  Now, ultimately, the border czar was shamed into making a quick stop in El Paso, but far [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=511.2s)]
*  away from the epicenter where the real crisis was happening. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, that was her first and only visit to the border. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  And a year later, in 2022, she told Chuck E. Todd that the border was secure. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=524.16s)]
*  She lied, flat out lied, just like she lied about Joe Biden being so cognitively sharp [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=529.36s)]
*  and so aware and so on his game. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=535.4s)]
*  That was a lie, too. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=538.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=539.68s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=540.68s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=543.88s)]
*  Congress to do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=550.0s)]
*  The first request we made, pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=551.08s)]
*  The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=559.44s)]
*  We're going to have two million people cross this border for the first time ever. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=563.24s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=566.12s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=569.76s)]
*  our administration. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=577.8s)]
*  But there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  We have a secure border is a lie. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=586.62s)]
*  That wasn't the only blatant lie that Kamala told about the border. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=592.98s)]
*  Here's your border czar smearing border patrol. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=596.26s)]
*  Remember when she falsely accused them of whipping migrants? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=599.62s)]
*  Another lie. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=602.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=603.98s)]
*  I've been very clear about the images that you and I both saw of those law enforcement [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  officials on horses. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=610.76s)]
*  I was outraged by it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=612.64s)]
*  It was horrible and deeply troubling. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  Human beings should not be treated that way. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=620.4s)]
*  As we all know, it also evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history where [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=622.16s)]
*  that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country, has [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=628.88s)]
*  been used against African Americans during times of slavery. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=634.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  This was a complete hoax and lie. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=640.7s)]
*  The images in question featured border patrol agents on horseback using reins to control [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=642.44s)]
*  their horses. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=647.64s)]
*  Kamala didn't care. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=648.88s)]
*  She is always, you know, ready to defame those who keep our country safe. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=650.32s)]
*  Now here's a flashback to her time in the U.S. Senate when she compared ICE officials [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=655.08s)]
*  to the KKK. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=659.76s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=661.48s)]
*  The Klan was what we would call today a domestic terrorist group. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=663.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=667.76s)]
*  Why would we call them domestic terrorist group? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=668.76s)]
*  Because they tried to use fear and force to change political environment. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=672.2s)]
*  And what was the motivation for the use of fear and force? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=676.82s)]
*  It was based on race and ethnicity. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=679.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=681.24s)]
*  Are you aware of the perception of many about how the power and the discretion at ICE is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=682.24s)]
*  being used to enforce the laws? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=691.08s)]
*  And do you see any parallels? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=694.24s)]
*  I do not see any parallels between officers and agents. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about perception. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  I do not see a parallel between what is constitutionally mandated as it relates to enforcing the law. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=701.36s)]
*  Are you aware that there's a perception? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  Are you aware that there's a perception? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=709.76s)]
*  I see no perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=710.76s)]
*  Is that what you're asking me? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=714.08s)]
*  And while Kamala is out there trashing the American people, she is more than generous [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=716.68s)]
*  with your tax money. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=721.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=722.6s)]
*  The bill also says, quote, every individual who is a resident of the United States is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=724.36s)]
*  entitled to benefits for health care services under this act. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=729.2s)]
*  Not every individual who's a citizen, but every individual who's a resident. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=732.3s)]
*  So you support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=735.92s)]
*  country illegally? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=740.52s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=742.04s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=744.4s)]
*  to public safety, public education or public health, period. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=751.6s)]
*  How many of you actually knew that she was supported free health care for illegal immigrants? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=758.68s)]
*  Just maybe illegal immigrants are pouring across the border because Kamala is offering them [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=763.48s)]
*  a free ride at your expense. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=767.98s)]
*  And as we speak, a massive multi-thousand-person caravan, they're headed right now to your [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=770.12s)]
*  southern border. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=775.1600000000001s)]
*  Apparently, they're trying to make their way across while Joe and Kamala are still [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  in power. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=780.08s)]
*  So the question tonight, what will your border czar do? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=781.08s)]
*  Will she finally address the root causes of illegal immigration? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  Will she send the caravan back home or give them free health care and education and give [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  them free four-star hotels in New York City? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=792.6s)]
*  Or will she allow them all easy access into the country and give them the right to vote? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=795.96s)]
*  Will she even mention this crisis in the coming days and weeks? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=800.84s)]
*  Don't count on it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=804.36s)]
*  Don't count on the media to ask her either. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=805.48s)]
*  Tonight, Vice President Harris, well, earlier today, she was in Texas, but she just couldn't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=807.96s)]
*  be bothered to pay a visit to the border. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=813.76s)]
*  Now, tonight, coming up, we're going to examine Kamala's record on Israel. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=816.4000000000001s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=820.2800000000001s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, not good. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=821.48s)]
*  Law and order, not good. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=823.52s)]
*  The Jussie Smollett hoax and much, much more. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=825.48s)]
*  And why won't she be showing up when the prime minister of Israel, our closest ally, shows [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=828.48s)]
*  up here on Wednesday for a speech before a joint session of Congress? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=833.16s)]
*  Why not, Kamala? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwF4MQ8HJa0&t=838.24s)]
