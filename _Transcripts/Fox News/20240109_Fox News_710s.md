# Voters can vote with their eyes or with what Democrats tell them to see: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0)
*  We're now with reaction Fox News contributors Joe Contra Kellyanne Conway and the host of outkicks Tommy Lahren is fearless Tommy Lahren [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=0.0s)]
*  Kellyanne start with you the polls speak volumes, but here's the strategy. It's emerging. It's very simple [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=7.66s)]
*  They're gonna talk about MAGA Republicans Trump Trump Trump. They're gonna talk about January 6 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=14.02s)]
*  They're gonna demagogue abortion and then they're gonna use the old playbook Republicans are racist sexist homophobic xenophobic [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Islamophobic transphobic and they want dirty air and water. Will it work? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=26.72s)]
*  It should not work if we let it work we are the stupid parties new Gingrich sometimes likes to say I don't think it'll work [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=33.14s)]
*  Cuz I have faith in the American people Sean [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=39.08s)]
*  This is a choice between what you see with your own two eyes and what they tell you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=41.0s)]
*  You should see with your own two eyes. We see the rising crime the rising prices. We know what's going on in the Middle East [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=46.3s)]
*  We see every single day because of Fox News and people like Bill Mollusk and Sarah Carter and you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=52.22s)]
*  Showing us what's going on at the border people know what they see and they're going to vote according to that now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=57.62s)]
*  Joe Biden has nothing else [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=63.3s)]
*  Big people talk about big ideas and big policy issues small people talk about other people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=65.3s)]
*  He has nothing else his poll numbers are not just down in disapproval generally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=70.78s)]
*  But on every major issue that America says is important to them [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=76.1s)]
*  Joe Biden has made history as being the oldest least inspiring least accomplished and least ready to lead [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  President we've had in the wild if Michelle Obama has a problem with all this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=86.64s)]
*  Then she should have a talk with Joe Biden and ding ding ding somebody we rarely hear from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=89.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris she's made history to not why you think she's made history because her approval rating is the lowest of any vice president [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  Since we've been looking at it [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=102.44s)]
*  One last thing Sean on all of this. Well, I want to ask you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=104.44s)]
*  As a poster, oh [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=107.46s)]
*  Yeah, no as a pollster. I'm just wondering because you've done this for years and you see that he's losing huge numbers [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=110.05999999999999s)]
*  demographically Hispanic Americans African Americans young people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=118.1s)]
*  Women that are female voters like how real are these numbers because he's losing in some cases 20 25% of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=123.94s)]
*  Support that is the base of the Democratic Party [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  The numbers are real Sean and the excuse the Democrats use to keep Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the ticket is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=136.0s)]
*  Trump Trump Trump [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=142.28s)]
*  I challenge everyone out there if you would have a conversation with someone who is supporting Biden [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  Ask them a question about Biden and see how many words or seconds it takes them to say Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=148.68s)]
*  They can't get to 10 seconds or 10 words without Trump Trump Trump. They simply cannot define it now [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, you just said is important [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=159.72s)]
*  I think that we're gonna have a record number turn record number of voters among Hispanics [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=161.34s)]
*  Why is that relevant because one in every four schoolchildren in this country is Hispanic Hispanics on average or 30 years old as the average age of? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=165.02s)]
*  Hispanics whites average age 44 Asians and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=172.06s)]
*  African Americans about 35 37 [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=175.58s)]
*  This is important because if you can lock up the Hispanic vote if you can improve at 5 7 12 percent [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=177.9s)]
*  You basically win the election. I think Trump will do better among independents among first-time voters [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  He'll do much better among [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=188.72s)]
*  Certain groups of women than people predict because they are so sick and tired of being talked to from the waist down only [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=190.72s)]
*  You know, it's a waist up for me my eyes my ears my heart my mouth and my brain and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=195.56s)]
*  Whichever party and its candidates are willing to talk to women from the waist up also can prevail [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=201.04s)]
*  January 6 2017 they talked about golden showers and Russia collusion [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=206.64s)]
*  They briefed the president-elect at Trump Tower January 6 2021 is all Joe Biden can focus on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=211.04s)]
*  I can't believe this man goes to hallowed ground like Liberty like the Liberty Belt Independence Hall in Pennsylvania [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=217.46s)]
*  like the AME Church where nine innocent people were slaughtered and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=223.78s)]
*  Castigates and denigrates and divides us people aren't gonna buy it. They want to be lifted up not brought down by their presidents [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=227.54s)]
*  Let me go to Tommy Tommy with the old playbook Maggert Republicans democracy in peril January 6 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=234.18s)]
*  January 6 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  You know is any of this gonna work Nazi analogies do you see that working is that resonating? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  You're in touch with young people more than the three of us [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=250.32s)]
*  No offense to my fellow panelists, but you know young people inspired by that. Does that mean anything to them? I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Don't think they're inspired by it, but unfortunately it did work in 2020 [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=261.08s)]
*  We know Joe Biden really launched his campaign with video images from Charlottesville [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=265.2s)]
*  So this playbook has worked for them before but the Biden campaign is operating as if Trump is the nominee and he very well [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=269.18s)]
*  Could be the Republicans can't fall into the trap though of operating like Joe Biden is gonna be the nominee because as you know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=276.06s)]
*  Sean, I don't think he's going to be I think come the convention. We're gonna have a major shakeup [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  So if Republicans are smart [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=286.18s)]
*  We will operate and campaign as if we are campaigning against any Democrat whether that be Gavin Newsom or Michelle Obama [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=288.06s)]
*  That's how Republicans need to play this game because simply focusing on frail Joe and lost Joe and horrible economy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=294.52s)]
*  Joe that's gonna work to decimate Joe's poll numbers [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=301.9s)]
*  But if Joe was not the nominee we better have a backup plan and we better educate the American people on why the Republican choice [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  If that's Donald Trump is the better choice [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=311.32s)]
*  remind them what life was like under Donald Trump and how good things were remind the young people who maybe were [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=313.4s)]
*  Quite young during that time how great things were and that they could maybe afford to buy a house or pay their rent or pay [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  For gas back when Donald Trump was their president [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=324.86s)]
*  So that has to be the move [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=327.42s)]
*  I would also say this pay very close attention to how the Obamas operate here because they don't want their legacy tied to a failing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=328.46s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=335.26s)]
*  So if it looks like Joe Biden is is really falling and tumbling even more so than he is now [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=335.9s)]
*  I think they're gonna jump ship. So watch them watch their moves. They're really in charge here [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=340.86s)]
*  All right, so let me go to Joe conscious Joe you you analyze the media better than anybody you should have your own media show [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=346.12s)]
*  It'd be great [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=353.12s)]
*  But there was apparently an invitation only meeting briefing in Delaware with the media [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=354.56s)]
*  The biggest contributors to Joe's campaign in 2020 they allowed him to hide in the basement. They never fact-checked him [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=360.56s)]
*  They're not gonna fact-check his failed record. The only thing I would add to what Tommy said and I think she's right on the mark is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=367.68s)]
*  Now the difference between [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=373.58s)]
*  2024 and 2020 is Joe has a record and his record is atrocious [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=375.74s)]
*  So in this briefing I'm assuming that the mob and the media your friends, you know, the blue checkmark, you know media cult [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=380.18s)]
*  Basically are getting their talking points and and basically being spoon-fed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=389.54s)]
*  What the Biden campaign is gonna want them to say? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=394.42s)]
*  The old sports analogy Sean is yes [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=398.1s)]
*  They're working the refs and the refs are more than willing to be worked here as stenographers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=400.02s)]
*  And this is a case of a broken record being played to avoid talking about an actual record to Kellyanne's point earlier [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=404.78s)]
*  And because if this is this president's grand opening argument to kick off his campaign in 2024 [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=411.24s)]
*  By saying that he and he alone can save democracy then Joe Biden is in serious serious trouble when it comes to reelection [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=416.74s)]
*  For starters, this is a president who spent [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=422.86s)]
*  138 days last year in relaxing locations and posh vacation spots that was in 2023 [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=425.96s)]
*  So apparently saving democracy will be done on a you know [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  Part-time basis chock-full of long weekends at Bernie's and and we're seeing an obvious common thread in these speeches from Biden lately in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=435.14s)]
*  Terms of what we're not hearing about no mention of the wonders of by dynamics [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=442.26s)]
*  No mention of Americans drowning in credit card debt [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=445.62s)]
*  No mention of the crisis that is a catastrophe at the US southern border that even Democrats more and more astounding the alarm about no [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=448.5s)]
*  Mention about US test scores at their lowest in decades [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=454.5s)]
*  No mention of the US looking like a complete and utter laughingstock to our adversaries because the commander-in-chief [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=456.64s)]
*  Apparently has no idea where his defense secretary is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=461.84s)]
*  Issues and common sense will win this election and if Joe Biden thinks he could run by ignoring his own record and strictly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=464.96s)]
*  Demonizing Donald Trump who has the issues on his side. He will go down as the first one term Democratic president since Jimmy Carter [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=471.76s)]
*  Here's the problem with the January 6 fine if you want to criticize Trump and that's part of your argument [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=479.44s)]
*  That's fair [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=484.28s)]
*  And you could say he should have done a B or C. That's fair, too [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=485.4s)]
*  Here's the problem. They've never wanted to get to the whole story [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=489.28s)]
*  The worst thing about the January 6 committee is they never put together a plan to prevent something like that forever happening again [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=492.24s)]
*  The other thing Joe is they never talked about the riots [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  They never spoke out about those riots in the summer of 2020 and there were five hundred and seventy four of them [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=502.56s)]
*  So I don't think it's rioting that they really cared about but they never talked about even NBC and Lester Holt [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=508.32s)]
*  Lester Holt reported there was actionable intelligence in the days leading up to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=514.3s)]
*  January 6 that never came up in Liz Cheney's hearings or the fact that the police chief the Capitol Police Chief [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=518.78s)]
*  Sund who I've interviewed who wrote a book about it. He saw the intelligence. He was begging for for [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=527.38s)]
*  National Guard help then I have the acting defense secretary Miller his chief of staff Mark Meadows [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=533.86s)]
*  President Trump the days leading up to January 6 they never tell the story that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=539.84s)]
*  Donald Trump talked about bringing up the guard and they'll never mention that he said many of you will peacefully and patriotically [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=544.44s)]
*  March to the Capitol so your voices will be heard [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's an incomplete picture, but they acted in the media went completely along with the total narrative [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=554.48s)]
*  That misses very key aspects that need to be examined if you really don't like [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYSpaoocX0&t=561.6s)]
