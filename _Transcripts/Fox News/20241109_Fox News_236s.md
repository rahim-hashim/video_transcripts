# Tulsi Gabbard: If Trump asks me to serve, I'd be honored
**Fox News:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s)
*  now. She is the co-chair of President Trump's transition team, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=0.0s)]
*  When you think about going into the administration, I think you are a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=6.24s)]
*  phenomenal asset in so many ways that people that I know that people may not [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  know. And I've got to imagine that there is a position in this administration for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=15.4s)]
*  you. Are you interested? This is up to President Trump. Obviously he's looking to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=20.84s)]
*  assemble a team right now. If he asked me to serve in a position where I feel I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=27.88s)]
*  can be effective to help him carry out his objectives, of course I'd be honored [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=32.44s)]
*  to do that. Let me ask you about, women were lied to about abortion in a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=37.08s)]
*  whole variety of ways. Old people will lied about Donald Trump taking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=44.8s)]
*  away Social Security and Medicare. The Harris-Walls ticket supported gender [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=49.84s)]
*  affirming care for minors without parental consent. They support sex change [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=55.28s)]
*  operation and amnesty for illegal immigrants. And then they say they care [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=61.56s)]
*  about women's rights but they were completely silent on all of the women [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=66.36s)]
*  that, the dozens of them that were murdered by their unvetted illegal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=71.28s)]
*  immigrants, the dozens that were raped by those people or accused of it. They don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=76.4s)]
*  seem to care about the hundreds of Americans victims of violent crimes by [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=82.28s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants. How big, how important were these topics to voters in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=86.36s)]
*  your view? How big an impact did it have on this race? Yeah Sean, that's one of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  things that really gave me hope in seeing the results of this election is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=99.48s)]
*  the American people, the vast majority of the American people didn't fall for the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=103.92s)]
*  lies and the propaganda that they were pushing out and they saw through them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=109.56s)]
*  They saw that in Kamala Harris and in the Democrat elite and those who were [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  backing and propping her up and the propaganda media and big tech and so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  forth, they saw that these are people who don't really care about the American [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=123.04s)]
*  people. That Kamala Harris was saying things that she thought would [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=127.16s)]
*  convince voters to support her. Whereas when you look at President Trump, you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  know throughout the campaign, he delivered the same message everywhere he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=135.96s)]
*  went regardless of the demographic of people that he was talking to. He wasn't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  trying to curate his message to tell people just what he thought they wanted [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=144.8s)]
*  to hear and he was addressing very real issues that the American people are most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=149.28s)]
*  concerned about and so in the results of this election we saw of course a vast [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=154.52s)]
*  majority of Americans placing their trust and confidence in President Trump, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=159.36s)]
*  delivering a mandate and rejecting Kamala Harris's agenda of open borders, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=163.96s)]
*  of censorship, of free speech, of freedom of religion, of crime in our communities, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=170.4s)]
*  her agenda of continuing to wage stupid, costly and unnecessary wars that are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=176.36s)]
*  counterproductive to the interests of the American people and instead embraced [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=182.8s)]
*  President Trump's vision and promise, rejecting the neocons and warmongers of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Washington promising to end wars and prevent World War Three and nuclear war, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=192.6s)]
*  you know bring our economy back to life, lower the cost of living and and make [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=196.92s)]
*  life better for the American people. So this is a clear mandate that the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=201.68s)]
*  American people have delivered in this election and I hope these entrenched [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=206.2s)]
*  politicians in Washington are paying attention or they will see themselves [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  potentially the next election without a job. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=215.48s)]
*  Tulsi, thanks for all you've done in this whole you know campaign. You've been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=218.04s)]
*  amazing. I appreciate it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIA8LcJh_s&t=222.28s)]
