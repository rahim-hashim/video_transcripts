# Biden is the 'grim reaper for American democracy': Stephen Miller
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws)
*  All right, here now with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=0.0s)]
*  Former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller, Fox News contributor Charlie [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=1.44s)]
*  Hurt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=5.76s)]
*  All right, let's start with Iowa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=6.76s)]
*  Latest polls out of New Hampshire. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=8.52s)]
*  The thing I worry about Steve Miller in New Hampshire is they have this open primary provision [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=10.4s)]
*  that people can switch affiliations, they can—Democrats can vote, say they're independent, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=16.88s)]
*  switch their affiliation, vote in the Republican primary, and at least 4,000 up to now have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=23.0s)]
*  done that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=29.02s)]
*  Okay, Trump is leading in most polls by double digits. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=30.02s)]
*  Does that have a big impact on this race on Tuesday? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=35.22s)]
*  Well, it really is quite amazing, Sean, that there's still the ability of Democrats to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=38.82s)]
*  determine the outcome of a presidential primary in New Hampshire. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  But Republican voters deeply resent the other party trying to determine their nominee, trying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  to switch over and vote for Nikki Haley over Donald Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  I believe there will be a massive backlash effect to this effort to court Democrat voters [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=60.86s)]
*  to interfere in the primary, and ultimately that backlash effect will drive President [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=66.22s)]
*  Trump's numbers even higher, particularly because after that massive historic win in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=71.66s)]
*  Iowa, twice anything that's ever happened in America before, he has unified the party [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=77.34s)]
*  behind him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=82.28s)]
*  You heard that incredible presentation from Senator Rubio about why he's endorsing President [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=83.34s)]
*  Trump, and I expect that his numbers in New Hampshire in the weeks ahead are just going [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=87.78s)]
*  to keep going—or the days ahead, I should say, are going to keep going up and up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=91.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to get your take on this, Charlie, because they want to extend out the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=95.14s)]
*  Republican primary as long as possible in the hopes that Republicans, you know, spend [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=101.76s)]
*  all this money going after each other. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=106.5s)]
*  I just don't like the system. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=109.54s)]
*  I mean, even Governor Sununu, who's supporting Nikki Haley, fine for him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  Even he acknowledged to Neil Cavuto in an interview that, you know, he doesn't like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  this either, and that the idea that some of these people would try to muddy the waters [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=121.9s)]
*  and play games like this in his state and then have every intention of voting for the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=128.54s)]
*  Democrat, they have no business being in the Republican primary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=134.02s)]
*  Well, certainly, every Republican who's trying to keep this going needs to be aware [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=138.46s)]
*  that the longer it keeps going, you know, the longer we have this internal fight, as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=143.62s)]
*  opposed to Donald Trump turning his focus on fighting Joe Biden and getting Joe Biden [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=148.82s)]
*  out of the White House. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  But I think it's really interesting here, you know, we saw the effort by Democrats—and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=155.68s)]
*  this is an old, a long, you know, a tactic that both parties have tried over the years—where [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=161.06s)]
*  you have a Democrat, you know, savvy Democrat voters in Iowa participate in the Republican [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=167.06s)]
*  caucuses trying to sow chaos in the other party. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=172.74s)]
*  But this is what's sort of interesting, and I think a lot of people have sort of glossed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=177.5s)]
*  over is usually, or always, when that happens, the Democrats are trying to get the weakest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=180.66000000000003s)]
*  candidate elected, which I think is really interesting here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  And we're going to see it again in New Hampshire, where Democrats play in the Republican primary [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=191.3s)]
*  in the Republican caucus in an effort to get the weakest candidate in all—to get the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=196.54s)]
*  nomination. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=202.38s)]
*  And in this case, that's Nikki Haley. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=203.38s)]
*  And I think it's really interesting that Democrats seem to have a better grasp of the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=205.61999999999998s)]
*  real truth here, which is Donald Trump is the most formidable candidate who could face [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump—Joe Biden in November. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  He can prosecute the case against Joe Biden better than anybody, and Democrats are terrified [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=220.7s)]
*  of facing Donald Trump, not only because it's going to be four more years of Donald Trump, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=226.06s)]
*  but also because they realize he is the most formidable candidate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=230.78s)]
*  And so that's why they're getting in, trying to cross over, and supporting Nikki Haley [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=234.62s)]
*  in the primary. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=238.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=239.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they're saying, oh, democracy in peril, that's one of their big fear tactics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=240.86s)]
*  But yet they're the party that's trying to keep Donald Trump off ballots in states. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  How ironic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=250.38s)]
*  And they're the ones that want to pile on more criminal charges, as many as possible, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  and weaponize our justice system. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=257.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a joke. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=258.92s)]
*  I'll give you the last word quickly, both of you, starting with Steve. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=259.92s)]
*  This election is absolutely a referendum on the survival of American democracy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=265.64s)]
*  But the grim reaper for American democracy—and by the way, he's looking more and more like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=270.72s)]
*  the grim reaper visually—is Joe Biden. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=274.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party is using the legal system to try to imprison President Trump, to try [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  to bankrupt President Trump, to try to take away the voices of the American people, to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=284.44s)]
*  censor, to blacklist, to banish, to jail. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=289.16s)]
*  It is fascism. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  It is authoritarianism. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  If you want to save American democracy in 2024, then your only hope and prayer is to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=295.24s)]
*  vote for Donald Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, they can't run on one thing, Charlie. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  Steve is exactly right about this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=305.12s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=306.12s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=307.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=309.96s)]
*  And Stephen is exactly right about this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=310.96s)]
*  If Democrats get away with these tactics and win an election doing this, they will never [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=312.56s)]
*  use any other tactics to win an election. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=317.88s)]
*  They can't run on a positive record because they don't have one. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=321.76s)]
*  It really is that simple. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's going to be negative, negative the entire time, scare people, the usual tactics, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=328.08s)]
*  and that's all they're going to want to talk about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=334.12s)]
*  And Joe will probably hide in the basement. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=336.36s)]
*  I don't know which basement, Delaware, the White House. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=338.56s)]
*  He'll be in some basement. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=340.68s)]
*  All right, thank you both. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVLlvjIOws&t=342.16s)]
