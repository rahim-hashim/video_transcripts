# DeSantis doesn’t have time for Kamala’s 'shenanigans': Tomi Lahren
**Fox News:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw)
*  All right, here with reaction, the host of Tommy Lahren is Fearless on Outkick, Tommy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=0.0s)]
*  Lahren and Outkick founder Clay Travis. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=3.68s)]
*  None of this negates what we saw, for example, in North Carolina, where there was such devastation, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=6.8s)]
*  Tommy, and where there is still devastation, and that they were completely missing in action [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=14.0s)]
*  for a week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=19.72s)]
*  About five or six days later, then we find out from Mayorkas that, yeah, FEMA is running [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=20.96s)]
*  out of money. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  And then we find out from his words, not mine, then we talk to people on the ground. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=29.16s)]
*  Sarah Carter was parked there for days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=32.96s)]
*  Nobody saw a single person from the Harris-Biden administration there to help them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=35.8s)]
*  Then we find out from FEMA's own website that the money, over a billion dollars, was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=41.16s)]
*  diverted to help their unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=45.64s)]
*  And then we find out their top priorities. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Number one is DEI, and number two is climate change. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  So the criticism has been warranted. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  I still don't think North Carolina is getting the support they deserve. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=58.12s)]
*  And now, if you criticize them, they're mad at you for criticizing them when this is the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=61.8s)]
*  worst hurricane response I've ever, that I think has ever happened in the history of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=67.4s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=71.92s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=72.92s)]
*  Well, this is the same song and dance from the Biden administration through and through. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=73.92s)]
*  When people are struggling, they simply tell people that what they're going through is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=78.12s)]
*  not happening. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=81.72s)]
*  And they're more concerned with what they call misinformation or disinformation, meaning [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  the narrative not looking good for Democrats, than they are about people suffering and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=87.28s)]
*  struggling. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=91.44s)]
*  But I'll also say this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=92.44s)]
*  If your state is going through a natural disaster, you want Governor Ronda Santis to be your [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=93.56s)]
*  leader. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=98.2s)]
*  He doesn't have time for Kamala's shenanigans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=99.2s)]
*  He doesn't have time for her trying to get her moment of spotlight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=102.08s)]
*  He's busy taking care of the people of Florida. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=105.64s)]
*  That's his responsibility. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=108.16s)]
*  And that's what he does with every disaster, whether it be COVID, whether it be a collapsing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=109.16s)]
*  condominium, whether it be hurricanes, natural disasters, tornadoes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=114.4s)]
*  Ronda Santis is there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=118.56s)]
*  He's getting the work done. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  And Kamala is busy doing Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=121.72s)]
*  Maybe she got that confused and now she wants to call the Santis, but he doesn't have time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  for her phone call. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=129.5s)]
*  He's busy taking care of his people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=130.5s)]
*  Clay, I interviewed him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=132.56s)]
*  I said, Governor, did you get a call from Kamala Harris? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  I said, and then he said, I asked my staff, did we get a call from Kamala Harris? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  They said, no. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=143.16s)]
*  The call never even came in that she's claiming that that she made. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=144.92s)]
*  Well, does it surprise anybody that Kamala would have the wrong number when she needs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=149.56s)]
*  to try to get an actual job done? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=155.68s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=157.38s)]
*  A couple of things here, Sean. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=158.38s)]
*  I'm going to be in Asheville, North Carolina tomorrow. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=159.38s)]
*  Our radio show leads right into your radio show. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to be at our affiliate in Asheville. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=165.32s)]
*  I'm flying in on a helicopter. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=167.28s)]
*  I'm going to see exactly what's going on. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=168.66s)]
*  And then we're raising money for Hurricane Helene relief in Knoxville without kick shows [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=171.2s)]
*  at Yee Haw Brewery there in downtown Knoxville. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=176.76s)]
*  So if people are in that area, going to be there for the Florida-Tennessee game. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  We're going to try to make a difference East Tennessee, Western North Carolina. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=182.92s)]
*  But I think really here, Sean, the biggest story is, have you paid attention to how Joe [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Biden has slapped back every time he's been asked the last couple of days about Ron DeSantis [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=190.76s)]
*  not getting a call from Kamala Harris or not calling her back? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=197.12s)]
*  This is one thing that I think Trump is 100% right on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=200.68s)]
*  I don't think that Joe Biden likes Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=203.58s)]
*  We don't agree. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=206.32s)]
*  I don't think most people would disagree on that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=207.32s)]
*  But I think he hates Kamala Harris. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think he actually likes Ron DeSantis and respects the work he's done responding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=211.9s)]
*  to hurricanes as everyone should. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=215.88s)]
*  And when he answers those questions, you know, Sean, he never takes questions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  He never stands there and waits for media to ask him questions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=222.52s)]
*  Two straight days, he was asked whether DeSantis should call Kamala back, and he declined to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=225.62s)]
*  say yes and said that he thought Ron DeSantis was doing a great job, said, you know, Ron [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  DeSantis had his phone number. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=235.74s)]
*  DeSantis has been complimentary about Trump and Biden when it comes to hurricanes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=237.86s)]
*  I think Kamala Harris just falling apart, and this is emblematic of her collapsing campaign. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=241.46s)]
*  Exit question. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=246.86s)]
*  Will their lack of response and empathy and compassion and their lack of preparedness, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=247.86s)]
*  Is it going to impact the election? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=254.38s)]
*  Yes or no, Tommy? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=255.9s)]
*  I think it absolutely should, if not for the FEMA dollars. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=257.46s)]
*  But also, when you've got things going wrong in your country, around the world, you need [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=260.62s)]
*  somebody who's ready to step up to the plate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=264.3s)]
*  Kamala Harris has proven that she is not ready to step up to any plate anytime soon, maybe [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=266.02s)]
*  in her entire life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=270.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=272.38s)]
*  Clay, will it impact? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=273.38s)]
*  I think it will impact things for Trump in a positive way, because I think North Carolinians, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=276.3s)]
*  Georgians, Tennesseans, South Carolinians, Virginians, everybody out there who's seen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=280.06s)]
*  this awful response doesn't want Kamala anywhere near disaster or the resolute desk. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=283.86s)]
*  I think it's going to work to Trump's favor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=289.3s)]
*  By the way, I'm glad you're going there with Buck tomorrow, and I hope you raise a lot [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=291.74s)]
*  of money. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  I've been donating myself to SamaritansPurse.org. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=296.78s)]
*  There are a lot of good organizations, churches on the ground. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=299.82s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=302.9s)]
*  What you're doing with our affiliate there is amazing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=303.9s)]
*  I'm glad you're able to make it up there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=305.7s)]
*  Clay, thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=308.14s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=309.14s)]
*  Hey, Clay. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Qp3W_RDaw&t=310.14s)]
