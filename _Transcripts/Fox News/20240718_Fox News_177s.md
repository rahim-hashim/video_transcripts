# Sean Hannity: Why have Democrats been silent about the Trump assassination attempt?
**Fox News:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU)
*  Co-host of the hit show, The Five, Harold Ford, Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway will get to Franklin Graham's speech in just a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=3.0s)]
*  minute. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=8.56s)]
*  Let's get some instant reaction. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=9.56s)]
*  I do have a little bit of problem with some of your Democratic friends. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=10.56s)]
*  Why have they been so silent about the assassination? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=13.96s)]
*  There's not been a lot of outrage, no calls for investigation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=17.64s)]
*  That should be upsetting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=21.96s)]
*  That's not a red-blue, that's not a conservative, liberal, Democrat, Republican issue, Harold. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=22.96s)]
*  I know how you feel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=27.76s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=29.4s)]
*  First of all, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=30.4s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=31.4s)]
*  I know that Logan gave a great speech. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=32.4s)]
*  He is, as I shared with you, doing a thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=33.4s)]
*  He's one of my childhood idols. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=34.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=35.76s)]
*  To see him there was a big thing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=36.76s)]
*  Look, I think that the Secret Service director should either be suspended or should be fired. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=37.76s)]
*  I think the person who was in charge of that security that day, probably the Pittsburgh [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=43.44s)]
*  office or somewhere, they should be fired. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=47.32s)]
*  I think there's been some outrage on my side. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=49.6s)]
*  Maybe not enough, but we're in the middle of a political season. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  It's not loud. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay, middle of a political season. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  No, no, middle of a political season and Democrats are thinking about how we think about our [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  nominee and we should have a new one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  But I don't disagree with you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=61.4s)]
*  She should be suspended or should be fired. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=62.72s)]
*  I want to hear from more Democrats, Kellyanne. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, seriously, this—I've always said when Obama was president, we've got to protect [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=67.64s)]
*  him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=72.36s)]
*  I said it all the time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=73.36s)]
*  And his family. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=74.36s)]
*  And his family. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=75.36s)]
*  His children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=76.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=77.36s)]
*  It's just standard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=78.36s)]
*  I think you're saying you want to hear more compassion, you want to hear more— [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=79.36s)]
*  I want to hear more outrage over what happened here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=80.36s)]
*  Sure, that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=83.6s)]
*  Sean, I'm really struck, though, that the Democrats right now, the Democratic leaders, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=84.72s)]
*  aren't talking about caring about Joe Biden or Donald Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  They're talking about Joe Biden's effect on the electoral count, on politics. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  They're not being moral, they're being political. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=96.08s)]
*  They're not being—they're being medical. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=98.8s)]
*  They're not being emotional for him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Not one of them is coming up and saying, I love Joe Biden, I want him to go spend the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  rest of his presidency in Delaware. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=105.24s)]
*  They're saying, oh my God, he's going to call us to the House, the Senate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you both this, because the speculation— [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=108.88s)]
*  This is a political season in fairness, though, Kellyanne. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=110.28s)]
*  I hear you, Kellyanne, but this is politics. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=112.28s)]
*  This is politics here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=114.88s)]
*  You guys have had a great convention, and this is—I've been to 15 conventions, 14 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=115.88s)]
*  conventions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  This is the single best convention I've ever been to. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  But there's a reason for that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=122.88s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=123.88s)]
*  I call balls and strikes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=124.88s)]
*  By far. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=125.88s)]
*  All right, so let's ask. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=126.88s)]
*  Reports that Joe may not survive Sunday, may get out Sunday, then the White House is pushing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=127.88s)]
*  back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=131.88s)]
*  Is he going to survive? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=132.88s)]
*  I like Joe Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=133.88s)]
*  I'm for Joe Biden, but to be for Joe Biden, I agree with Kellyanne here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=135.24s)]
*  He needs to probably move on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=138.16s)]
*  You think so? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=139.72s)]
*  The ability, the energy to be able— [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=140.72s)]
*  He has to give it up, though. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=141.72s)]
*  Well, and I hope he reaches that decision, because I think it would be the best thing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  for the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=146.56s)]
*  Real quick, will he survive? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=147.56s)]
*  I've got to get this— [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=148.56s)]
*  It's going to be such chaos and crisis. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=149.56s)]
*  I love the fact that you have Dana White, Hulk Hogan talking about Donald Trump, the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=150.56s)]
*  businessman. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=153.0s)]
*  And Melania is here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=154.0s)]
*  You saw her. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=155.0s)]
*  She's here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=156.0s)]
*  She's here in the house. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=157.0s)]
*  I saw the—she has the picture. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=158.0s)]
*  She won't share it with me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=159.0s)]
*  Now, we do have Franklin Graham. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=160.0s)]
*  Melania Trump will come out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=161.0s)]
*  Eric Trump is speaking tonight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=162.0s)]
*  Dana White tonight. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  We've got a big night. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIIcWPcAfU&t=165.44000000000003s)]
