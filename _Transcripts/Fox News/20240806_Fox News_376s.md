# Ted Cruz: We believe we have an obligation to 'protect our families'
**Fox News:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y)
*  Now, a wide-open southern border is one of the biggest crisis that America is facing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=5.72s)]
*  It is a clear and present danger to every American, especially as we have sadly seen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=6.72s)]
*  Many of these illegals that are unvetted commit horrific crimes against our own citizens, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=11.24s)]
*  even children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=15.96s)]
*  And now the border crisis has gotten so out of control, it's actually bringing people [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=17.26s)]
*  together across the aisle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=21.46s)]
*  In Texas, things are so bad and have gotten so bad, Democrats are now endorsing Senator [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=23.36s)]
*  Ted Cruz. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=28.8s)]
*  A large group of Democratic law enforcement leaders are now joining a new group of Democrats [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=29.8s)]
*  for Cruz, and they're speaking up about the Senator's record of bipartisanship to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=35.32s)]
*  tackle big issues. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=40.54s)]
*  Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg is one of those Democrats, and she joins us now [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=42.08s)]
*  along with Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=47.28s)]
*  And it looks like you have a big crowd behind both of you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=49.0s)]
*  I appreciate you both being here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=51.32s)]
*  Madam Attorney General—District Attorney, I'd like to ask you—I know you've taken [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=54.56s)]
*  political heat for supporting Senator Cruz. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  You'll probably take more heat for being on this program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=63.2s)]
*  But we saw what happened to 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary, you know, brutalized for two hours. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=67.3s)]
*  This little girl fought back valiantly and was, you know, brutalized and murdered. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=74.68s)]
*  I interviewed her mother and her grandfather. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=81.36s)]
*  Tell us about why you believe Senator Cruz it's time to put partisanship aside and support [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=84.52s)]
*  him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=90.32s)]
*  Well, while Jocelyn Nungary is the reason that Ted Cruz and I started working together, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=91.32s)]
*  she's not the only reason that I support the Senator. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=99.56s)]
*  We've had a number of murders committed by undocumented, illegal aliens. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=102.52s)]
*  As a law enforcement official, the top one in the third biggest county in the country, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=108.38s)]
*  it's really important to stop the violence. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=114.34s)]
*  And Senator Cruz was willing to take action, file a bill called Justice for Jocelyn that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=117.3s)]
*  would have kept her murderers in custody had it been law today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=122.98s)]
*  And I felt that that was a very brave action, and I wanted to support it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  I think our border problem has existed for a long time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  It's time to fix it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  And Americans are tired of hearing why Democrats and Republicans won't work together. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=139.28s)]
*  This one will. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=144.38s)]
*  I don't understand the position, and I'm trying to be as very objective as I can, of defund, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=146.44s)]
*  dismantle, no bail laws. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  That doesn't keep the people of our community, small towns, big cities, safe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=158.54s)]
*  I don't know why there is this obsession. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=164.06s)]
*  I don't know why we don't enforce our border laws and insist that we vet people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=166.9s)]
*  I don't care where you come from. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=171.74s)]
*  Just come in legally, make sure we do a background check. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=173.3s)]
*  Then welcome to our family. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=176.18s)]
*  You know, it was the fact that they had no idea who they had captured and who they released [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=179.9s)]
*  that caused this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  If these defendants had been in custody and their backgrounds properly vetted with the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=186.94s)]
*  country they came from, we might have known more about them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=191.62s)]
*  But as it was, it's a blind catch and release program. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=195.38s)]
*  This on top of really bad bail laws, outlawing cash bail, these things have endangered our [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=198.82s)]
*  people and our citizenry. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=206.9s)]
*  And as the top law enforcement official, I just can't stand by and not fight back. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=208.96s)]
*  It's bigger than partisanship. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=214.56s)]
*  And our problems can be solved. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=217.32s)]
*  We just have to reach across the aisle and work together. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=219.78s)]
*  And there's a lot of things that we may not disagree on, but we're going to agree on this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=222.62s)]
*  one and we're going to fix this problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=226.44s)]
*  Senator Cruz, I know that... [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=229.26s)]
*  Sean, look. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=230.26s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=231.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=233.9s)]
*  Go ahead, Sean. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=234.4s)]
*  No, I know that Chuck Schumer has made you his number one target, but you're really looking [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=235.4s)]
*  for solutions so that we don't have another Lakin Riley, another Rachel Moore, another [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=240.02s)]
*  girl in a park in broad daylight in New York raped, or another Jocelyn Nungary situation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=245.9s)]
*  I know where your heart is on this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=252.5s)]
*  Well, Sean, Kim and I are both. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  In Houston, Texas, we just had a big rally. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=259.58s)]
*  We had law enforcement groups all across the state, whether sheriffs, elected sheriffs, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=261.86s)]
*  sheriff's organizations, police unions that have endorsed me, organizations representing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=266.82s)]
*  44,000 law enforcement officers across the state. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=271.3s)]
*  And Kim, it's a big deal that Kim is here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=275.9s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Kim has been elected, she's been in office two terms as the elected district attorney [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=280.12s)]
*  here in Harris County, here in Houston. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=284.56s)]
*  It's the largest city in Texas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  And she's been a Democrat her whole life, but she actually believes in locking up bad [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  guys. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=293.2s)]
*  She believes murderers belong in jail, rapists belong in jail. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=294.2s)]
*  And Kim is dismayed because she's looking at her own party and there are voices in her [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=298.2s)]
*  own party that... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=301.88s)]
*  This is me speaking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm not putting words in her mouth, but I think that have gone bat crap crazy, that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=304.96s)]
*  want to let murderers go, that want to let rapists go, and that have opened up the border. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=308.2s)]
*  And Kim and I are standing together because she thinks that public officials, regardless [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=313.44s)]
*  of party, we got an obligation to protect our families, to keep our families safe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=318.2s)]
*  And Jocelyn Nungre, a beautiful, wonderful 12-year-old girl, you and I have visited with [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=323.72s)]
*  her mom, Alexis, with her grandfather, Kelvin. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=331.68s)]
*  Kim is the district attorney who's prosecuting those murderers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=335.36s)]
*  And the act that they committed, it is unspeakable. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=338.72s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=342.32s)]
*  And we ought to come together and fight back against it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=343.88s)]
*  And listen, my election in Texas is between an open borders, abolish the police Democrat, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=347.06s)]
*  and standing up for law and order. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=352.12s)]
*  And we got to keep Texas safe. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=354.16s)]
*  And I just don't think real people, Democrats or Republicans, want that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=355.16s)]
*  We want to be safe, and our government has an obligation to keep us safe. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=358.96s)]
*  Amen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0LMUzlFE1Y&t=363.08s)]
