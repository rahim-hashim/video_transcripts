# They do ‘so little’ with Biden: Peter Doocy
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18)
*  And during today's press briefing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox White House correspondent, our own Peter Ducey, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=2.0s)]
*  confronted the White House press secretary, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=4.64s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre, over this strange blunder. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=6.96s)]
*  And as per usual, she refused to directly answer [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=9.8s)]
*  Peter's question. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=13.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=13.98s)]
*  How is President Biden ever going to convince [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=15.4s)]
*  the three quarters of voters who are worried [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=17.28s)]
*  about his physical and mental health that he is okay, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  even though in Las Vegas he told a story [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  about recently talking to a French president [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=25.22s)]
*  who died in 1996? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=27.48s)]
*  I'm not even gonna go down that rabbit hole with you, sir. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=29.78s)]
*  What is the rabbit hole? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=31.82s)]
*  We're gonna go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=32.66s)]
*  Go ahead, go ahead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  He said he talked to Minneron in... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=34.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=35.16s)]
*  You saw the president in Vegas, in California. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  You've seen the president in South Carolina. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=37.74s)]
*  You saw him in Michigan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=39.54s)]
*  I'll just leave it there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=41.44s)]
*  Our very own Peter Ducey is joining us now with more. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=43.96s)]
*  It's very obvious and transparent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=47.1s)]
*  We had Newt Gingrich on this show last night, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=49.5s)]
*  Peter, and yesterday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=52.22s)]
*  He's now, for the first time only now, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=53.66s)]
*  convinced that he doesn't think Joe is gonna make it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=55.84s)]
*  to November because the cognitive decline of late [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=58.94s)]
*  has been so steep. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  Do you see it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=64.38s)]
*  You're with him every day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=65.52s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=66.7s)]
*  Well, first of all, greetings from the bottom [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=69.9s)]
*  of a rabbit hole. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  It's great that we have connection down here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=73.34s)]
*  to be able to go live, but it is not a conspiracy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=75.46s)]
*  to ask questions about mistakes the president makes, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  considering that it is not one person saying [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=82.66s)]
*  this doesn't seem like it's right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=87.66s)]
*  It's three quarters of those polled by NBC News [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=90.22s)]
*  either have minor or major concerns about his mental [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  and physical health, and that includes half of Democrats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=98.06s)]
*  And of course, everybody misspeaks from time to time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=101.86s)]
*  However, not everybody is running to be the president, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=105.8s)]
*  and not everybody is running to be the oldest president ever. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  And so these things happen from time to time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=111.9s)]
*  There are very heavy issues that whoever the president is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=116.12s)]
*  next time, come January 2025, are gonna have to deal with. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  And again, it's three quarters of everybody polled [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=125.12s)]
*  by NBC News. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=128.08s)]
*  As to whether or not he's gonna go the distance [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=132.04s)]
*  this campaign, we have no reason to think that he's planning [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=133.88s)]
*  to step aside. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=136.32s)]
*  If he does, the plan is gonna be for the running mate, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=137.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris, to ascend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=141.08s)]
*  You know, you hear people talking about, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  oh, well, maybe there could be something at the convention. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=145.96s)]
*  There is nobody running a shadow campaign effective enough [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=149.12s)]
*  that it would make sense for them to slide somebody in there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=155.26s)]
*  The last time we really saw a prominent Democrat [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=158.48s)]
*  would be on your show debating Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=160.48s)]
*  It was Gavin Newsom, but you don't hear as much [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=163.84s)]
*  from him anymore. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=166.24s)]
*  Well, he's been out campaigning for Joe Biden. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=167.96s)]
*  To my mind, defending the impossible, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=171.32s)]
*  in the middle of my interview with Governor Newsom, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=173.84s)]
*  at one point I just stopped the interview. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=177.32s)]
*  I said, here's your problem. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=178.84s)]
*  The guy that you are praising so much is not capable [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  of sitting here next to me and having a conversation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=183.4s)]
*  on this level, because he's simply not. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=186.5s)]
*  Now, when you compare the hours that Donald Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=188.94s)]
*  will devote to interviews, and he makes one mistake, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=192.24s)]
*  boy, if it's Pelosi and Vice President Harris, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  and he mixes it up, they're not taking into account [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=199.16s)]
*  all of this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=202.84s)]
*  I can't think of a single event, and you correct me [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=204.02s)]
*  if I'm wrong, that Joe Biden, a clean event [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=206.72s)]
*  where he didn't have cognitive struggles or difficulty [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=209.8s)]
*  in determining whether to exit stage left or stage right, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=214.0s)]
*  because that's now become a big problem. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  I can't think of a clean event, can you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, the problem now is that they do so little with him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=223.36s)]
*  It really is just one or two on-camera events a week [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=227.28s)]
*  that every word is so heavily scrutinized. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=230.6s)]
*  When we first got on the Biden beat [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=233.52s)]
*  back in the social distance days, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=236.8s)]
*  it was like 10 reporters in the room with him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=238.68s)]
*  He wanted to talk after every single set [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=240.84s)]
*  of prepared remarks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  That was three or four times a week for two and a half years. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=244.32s)]
*  Now, it's three or four times a month at best, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=247.76s)]
*  and most of the time it's when he is exiting [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=252.84s)]
*  the White House South Lawn exit [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=255.84s)]
*  to go on a Marine One to fly somewhere, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=258.6s)]
*  and you have to shout at him, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=260.72s)]
*  and he's shouting back at you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=263.0s)]
*  because there's an aircraft 100 feet away. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=264.0s)]
*  So that does seem to be the strategy, though. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=267.82s)]
*  In fact, it was somebody in the... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the old Reagan trick with Sam Donaldson. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Sam, what's Sam? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=277.32s)]
*  Good to see you, can't hear you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=279.24s)]
*  But, you know, so other presidents have used [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=281.22s)]
*  the sound of a helicopter, go ahead. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=284.12s)]
*  Well, somebody in the second row at the press briefing today [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=288.16s)]
*  asked Corrine Jean-Pierre about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=290.76s)]
*  why there's no Super Bowl interview, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=292.44s)]
*  doesn't he want to have this huge audience? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Why has he done so many fewer press events [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=296.32s)]
*  and press availabilities than all of his recent predecessors? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=299.24s)]
*  And she said, I can't deny the numbers that they are fewer, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=302.48s)]
*  but he's gonna try to get out there in new ways. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=306.96s)]
*  And she mentioned radio interviews and podcasts [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=309.76s)]
*  and social media, which have been used by Barack Obama, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=312.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, and Biden 2020 very effectively. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  So these are not new things, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=320.32s)]
*  but they are basically telling us [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=321.84s)]
*  not to expect to see or hear more from him [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=323.82s)]
*  between now and November. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, I doubt he's gonna be going on [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  with Charlemagne Lagarde again, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=330.2s)]
*  who's been pretty critical lately, as many others have been. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=332.96s)]
*  He said nobody's actively running a shadow campaign, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=335.96s)]
*  and I would agree with you, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=338.76s)]
*  I don't think Gavin Newsom is doing that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=339.64s)]
*  I mean, he was very clear that in his mind, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=341.48s)]
*  if you take him at his word, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  and I'll take him at his word, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=346.04s)]
*  that Kamala Harris would be next up. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  However, does that negate the possibility [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=349.88s)]
*  you keep hearing the name Michelle Obama? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=353.16s)]
*  They go to Michelle Obama at the convention. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Will you take up the mantle? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=358.12s)]
*  Your country needs you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=360.16s)]
*  Is there that quiet shadow campaign maybe going on? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  I've seen no evidence of it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=367.12s)]
*  I have no reason to believe she wants to go back [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=368.88s)]
*  to Washington at all. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=371.6s)]
*  I don't think she liked it the first time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that would probably be optimism [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  by the 50 or so percent of Democrats [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=379.04s)]
*  who are pulled by NBC who are concerned [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  that Biden has mental or physical issues [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  that might be a problem for him in a second term. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=389.36s)]
*  But from people that we hear from, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  that's not something that Michelle Obama wants, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=394.12s)]
*  even though, as we've seen in the post-presidency [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=397.44s)]
*  with just book sales alone, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  she is probably the most popular Democrat alive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=403.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be interesting. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=407.84s)]
*  We'll certainly be watching. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL-Up_pcF18&t=409.56s)]
