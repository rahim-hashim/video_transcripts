# ‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’: Aviation experts highlight ‘major problem’ with DC aircraft crash
**Fox News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo)
*  Here with the very latest on last night's horrific crash, aviation attorney Sal Lagona is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=0.0s)]
*  Also former Black Hawk helicopter pilot, retired lieutenant, Colonel Darren Gobb is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=5.84s)]
*  Colonel, let's start with you. You've flown these Black Hawks. You know a lot about them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=13.92s)]
*  Tell us, you know, how is this even possible? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=18.96s)]
*  Yeah, good evening, Sean. And of course, at this time, too, I think we need to recognize [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=24.0s)]
*  that there is heroism still taking place on the ground. But what I see frequently as I've been [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=28.08s)]
*  watching this and analyzing things for the last two days or the last 48 hours at least, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=34.72s)]
*  since this happened, was two major things. One, I believe that there is a procedural error or [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=41.28s)]
*  problem here. Somebody violated the rules and procedures that surround D.C.'s national [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=48.64s)]
*  airspace. And that means, for example, like this Black Hawk helicopter, it could have broken the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=54.24s)]
*  altitude restrictions on the air corridors as they go down the Potomac River. I've heard reports now [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=61.6s)]
*  that the aircraft was up near 400 feet or so when it was restricted to be below 200 feet. That can [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=66.64s)]
*  cause serious problems when you've got fixed wing commercial airliners landing over top of you that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=73.36s)]
*  are counting on you being 200 feet lower than you might actually be. Second thing is communications. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=78.32s)]
*  Clarity to standard air traffic control communications goes back to all the stuff [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  you just listed about hiring practices within the FAA and personnel shortages. Some of the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  communications I've heard and recordings I've heard lead me to the conclusion that there were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  significant communication challenges where I believe that helicopter thought it was able to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  go behind the aircraft the FAA, the ATC told them to, and in fact did not see the aircraft [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  the ATC actually wanted them to go behind because there's two aircraft in that video, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=115.36s)]
*  one on the takeoff. I think they confused that one for the one they were supposed to be looking for. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  Sal, let me ask you. I mean, John Solomon reporting. Last night's mid-air collision [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=124.0s)]
*  proceeded by months of near misses and safety warnings. 2023, 19 near misses, one of the largest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=128.32s)]
*  totals of many years. The same happened last year, including at Reagan International. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=135.28s)]
*  Federal officials investigating. New York Times now saying control tower staffing at Reagan [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=141.76s)]
*  National was not normal during the crash last night. One air traffic control worker managing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=147.6s)]
*  the helicopters and the planes, a job for two people. Can you explain that to me? How is that possible? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=152.96s)]
*  That's just should not be possible, John. When I heard you reading off that list just now, I'm [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=160.08s)]
*  sitting there checking my list because that's probably what I've been talking about for the last [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=164.56s)]
*  three or four years. We don't have enough air traffic controllers. We've had a pilot shortage. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=168.72s)]
*  Whenever you have all of these things piling up on you, there's no instant fix. You just can't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=174.16s)]
*  throw a switch and have another 2,000 air traffic controllers. It's going to take three or four years [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=180.0s)]
*  to train all of those guys and gals to the point where they can actually run a cab at an airport. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=186.55999999999997s)]
*  And if the reports are true that we heard, that they were so understaffed at DCA, especially at [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=198.16s)]
*  DCA, where you have helicopter traffic mixing in with fixed-wing traffic, it's difficult on a good [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  day. It is horrible at night. And that's what they had to put up with last night, and that's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=211.6s)]
*  the result is tragic. Colonel, let me go back to you. Again, the shortage, you know, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=216.32s)]
*  one person doing two people's job, number one. Number two, if you go back, you know, to what was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=224.32s)]
*  taken down two days into the Trump administration, the FAA pushed to hire workers with severe [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=231.68s)]
*  intellectual disabilities and psychological psychiatric problems at the FAA. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=239.36s)]
*  Can you explain that to the American people and these families that lost their loved ones? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=246.8s)]
*  It's impossible to explain. Only can be disgusted. And that's, I think that's universally shared [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  across the country right now. Hopefully it is. But, you know, 100 percent correct there that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=259.2s)]
*  the pilot shortage is one problem, but it takes just as much training, by the way, to get [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=265.6s)]
*  an air traffic controller up to standard and operating the way they're supposed to be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=270.48s)]
*  And no air traffic controller, no matter how good they are, can handle the DC traffic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=274.72s)]
*  by themselves. And that's why the communication issue sticks out to me as a major problem in this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=280.0s)]
*  incident. We've been playing with fire in the DC national airspace for a long time with all the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=286.56s)]
*  people I've been talking to. They've been wanting to warn about this, but most of them have been [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=291.44s)]
*  forced to be kept silent. Yeah. And Sal, I have friends of mine that are pilots, and they've been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=296.56s)]
*  telling me for the longest times, you know, flying into New Jersey and New York airports has been [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=302.96s)]
*  difficult. And as the president described today, they fly around in circles because they're not [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=308.48s)]
*  ready to receive those planes because they're not prepared. So this has been going on for some time, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=314.72s)]
*  hasn't it? Little comfort to the families, but, you know, we want to prevent it from ever happening [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=319.76s)]
*  again. But when you talk about the go-arounds and the missed approaches that occurred over the last [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=325.52s)]
*  few days, that means somebody—there was too much traffic in a certain area that they just couldn't [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=331.92s)]
*  get them into the airport. I fly almost exclusively in the Northeast, and when I'm flying here, this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=337.52s)]
*  is the busiest area to fly anytime. You are counting on the air traffic controllers to do their job, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  you're also counting on your fellow pilots to do their job, because they have to do—you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=349.6s)]
*  we're kind of self-regulating. And so I've got to know that they're doing the right thing as well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  So any of the shortages that we've come up with over the years, we've got to correct them now, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  because it's going to take three or four years to catch up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  Wow, that's scary. All right, thank you both. We appreciate it, Darren and Sal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWhkIG5yVeo&t=370.72s)]
