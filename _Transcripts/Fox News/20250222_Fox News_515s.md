# DOGE exposes 'theft' of Americans' hard work, Stephen Miller says
**Fox News:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A)
*  All right, President Trump has been in office for one month, and he's already racked up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=0.0s)]
*  quite an impressive list of accomplishments. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=6.36s)]
*  Now, today at the White House and their press briefing, Deputy Chief of Staff, our friend [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=8.6s)]
*  Stephen Miller, had a complete rundown of them all. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=13.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=16.2s)]
*  No president comes close to what Donald Trump has achieved over just the last 30 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=17.88s)]
*  He has ended all DEI across the federal government. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=23.04s)]
*  He has also saved women's sports by ending the participation of men in women's sports. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=27.4s)]
*  He's reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=33.72s)]
*  country, male and female. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=38.4s)]
*  He has undertaken a historic cost-cutting effort across the federal government, launching [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  the first-ever Department of Government Efficiency, already saving $50 billion in a single year, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=45.2s)]
*  which over a 10-year period would be $500 billion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=51.16s)]
*  He has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to its correct and proper name, the Gulf of America. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=56.48s)]
*  He has ended the weaponization of the federal government. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=61.0s)]
*  He has ended all federal censorship of free speech. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=63.72s)]
*  He has also restored the death penalty at the Department of Justice. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  He has finally created a situation where the federal health agencies in this country will [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=72.1s)]
*  be focused on preventing disease. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=77.64s)]
*  Border crossings since the day he took office are down 95 percent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=80.04s)]
*  And he has used the United States military to fully seal the southern border, and he [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=85.92s)]
*  did it in under one month. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=90.04s)]
*  By the way, we'll begin our scroll of promises made, promises kept, like we always do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=92.64s)]
*  After that, Stephen Miller got the chance to give the meaty mob a little civics lesson. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=98.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=102.2s)]
*  It's epic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=103.2s)]
*  It is true that many of the people in this room for four years failed to cover the fact [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=104.2s)]
*  that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=108.84s)]
*  It is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that Elon [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  is not elected fail to understand how government works. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  So I'm glad for the opportunity for a brief civics lesson. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=123.44s)]
*  The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=126.22s)]
*  That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=131.66s)]
*  The threat to democracy, indeed the existential threat to democracy, is the unelected bureaucracy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=138.22s)]
*  of lifetime tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=144.22s)]
*  What President Trump is doing is he is removing federal bureaucrats who are defying democracy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=148.66s)]
*  by failing to implement his lawful orders, which are the will of the whole American people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=155.78s)]
*  Now all of that, which is amazing, a perfect follow up to Miller's incredible work on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=164.14s)]
*  fake news CNN earlier this week. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=169.1s)]
*  Let's remind you how that went down. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=171.44s)]
*  This president for the first time in history is committed to restoring accountability at [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=174.32s)]
*  every level of the federal government. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=180.04s)]
*  You may assert there's no waste in the Pentagon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  You may assert there's no waste in Treasury. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=185.44s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=187.48s)]
*  I don't think anyone would accept that, Stephen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=188.48s)]
*  Stephen, I don't think anyone would. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=190.48s)]
*  Then why are you not celebrating these cuts? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=191.92s)]
*  If you agree there is waste, if you agree there is abuse, if you agree there is corruption, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=193.96s)]
*  why are you not celebrating the cuts, the reforms that are being instituted every day [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=198.62s)]
*  that no action is taken? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=202.96s)]
*  The entire salaries of American workers that are taxed disappear forever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=204.84s)]
*  I'll never tell Stephen Miller to calm down. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=211.22s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, here with more is White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  advisor, Stephen Miller. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=217.96s)]
*  Those were great moments. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=221.18s)]
*  I love the civic lesson in between. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=222.88s)]
*  I mean, I know I'm never going to convince Carvel about knowing him for years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=225.12s)]
*  I've debated him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=229.28s)]
*  But if he wants to watch that party implode and be the party that is pro-illegal immigrant [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=230.28s)]
*  over the safety of Americans, if they want to be the party that stands up for men and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=237.52s)]
*  women's sports, and they want to be the party that is supporting the hundreds of billions [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=241.68s)]
*  that we will eventually find all throughout government going abroad for this radical left [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=247.9s)]
*  agenda, I'm fine with that because they'll never win another election. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=252.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's a very easy job for me to go out and promote what President Trump has done [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  in office these last 30 days because it has been so incredible, so long-awaited and so [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  truly transformative in the most amazing way for this country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=272.56s)]
*  You mentioned a few of those issues just now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  And President Trump, while he's winning on these 80-20 issues, Democrats are clinging [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=278.72s)]
*  to these radical losing propositions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=283.72s)]
*  Democrats are out there defending the idea that unelected bureaucrats don't have to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  listen to the will of the electorate, don't have to follow the results of the will of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  the people expressed through an election, but can do whatever they want. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=296.72s)]
*  Democrats are out there saying that we can and should spend tens of billions of dollars [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=300.42s)]
*  on radical left programs all over the world, in Bosnia, in Croatia, all throughout the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=304.9s)]
*  continent of Africa and everywhere else, but not here in America. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=311.34s)]
*  Democrats are out there saying that we need to have men competing in women's sports [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=315.7s)]
*  and that they're going to fight tooth and nail to ensure that men stay in women's sports. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=319.62s)]
*  Democrats are out there saying we need to have open borders and unlimited illegal immigration [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=325.02s)]
*  and even keep criminal illegal aliens in this country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=328.52s)]
*  On issue after issue, Sean, Democrats are continuing to show that they're nothing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=332.86s)]
*  from this election and they are determined to continue their track record of losing to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=338.0s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  So, they're going to call Trump names, they're going to chant and they're going to sing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  and they're going to cling to what is hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=349.16s)]
*  Now, I played earlier in the program. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=354.74s)]
*  I played Al Gore and I played Bill Clinton and I played Barack Obama. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=356.5s)]
*  And they talked about exactly what Donald Trump is actually doing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  Many Republicans in the House, the Senate, presidents, they also talked about it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=365.5s)]
*  There's one big difference. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  Now it's happening. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=372.5s)]
*  And I think the proof is going to be in the pudding and that's, I think the word transformational [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=374.34s)]
*  and consequential come to mind when talking about this first month. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=378.38s)]
*  Yes, transformational, consequential and absolutely in every way extraordinary because President [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=384.18s)]
*  Trump is doing exactly what he promised and he's doing what Americans have begged and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=392.98s)]
*  pleaded for for generations but no one has done. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=399.3s)]
*  He's not just talking about cutting waste out of government. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  He's laying off unproductive federal workers who are taking your tax dollars away from [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=404.74s)]
*  you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=410.3s)]
*  He's cutting out government programs that don't work or that worse abuse and hurt the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=411.38s)]
*  American people. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=415.22s)]
*  He's stopping federal censorship. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=416.22s)]
*  He's stopping weaponized government. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=418.1s)]
*  He's stopping the use of our intelligence services and our law enforcement services [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=420.22s)]
*  to hurt Americans and he said he's using those powers to protect Americans and American [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=424.38s)]
*  lives. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=429.5s)]
*  President Trump is actually following through on every single thing he campaigned on in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  the record time, Sean. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=436.98s)]
*  We're running out of time but it's not just USAID. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=439.3s)]
*  It's all across every government agency, isn't it? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=441.82000000000005s)]
*  And Elon thinks it's going to be well over a trillion dollars they find. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=445.3s)]
*  I mean that's insane. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the biggest scandals, Sean. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=450.38s)]
*  They're stealing from the American people. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=451.38s)]
*  They're stealing from us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=452.90000000000003s)]
*  They're stealing from our kids and our grandkids. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=454.22s)]
*  What President Trump has exposed through the Department of Government Efficiency should [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grt0y6okv6A&t=458.1s)]
