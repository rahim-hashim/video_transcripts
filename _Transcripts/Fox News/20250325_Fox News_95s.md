**Fox News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k)
*  You had an accident at 26, and you were jogging, and you had a very severe injury, and yes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=0.0s)]
*  you are in a wheelchair. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=6.68s)]
*  And I've gotten to know you, you are a personal friend of mine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=7.68s)]
*  I take it personally when friends of mine are attacked viciously for no reason, and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  there's no way in hell that this woman and her ex-post is going to convince me she meant [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=15.08s)]
*  anything other than what we all believe it to be." [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=19.52s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=23.12s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's another day and another disaster by the Democrats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  The reality is they have no vision, no policy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=30.44s)]
*  They have nothing to sell but hate, and Americans are not buying it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=33.56s)]
*  It's one reason why Texas is going to remain red and why Republicans are going to continue [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=37.88s)]
*  to win elections across the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=42.52s)]
*  The fact, Sean, is that Texas is actually in direct contrast to what she was talking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=44.38s)]
*  about. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=49.24s)]
*  Texas has ranked number one for the most new jobs in America over the past month, number [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=50.24s)]
*  one for the most new jobs over the past year, and for several years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=54.6s)]
*  Texas ranks number one for the most new economic development projects for 13 years in a row. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=58.2s)]
*  CEOs who run businesses have ranked Texas the best state for doing business for 20 years [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  in a row. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=68.4s)]
*  And Texas is in the vanguard as it concerns the future of the United States, such as space [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=69.4s)]
*  exploration, such as artificial intelligence, such as semiconductors, as well as power generation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=75.48s)]
*  The bottom line is that Republican states like Texas are leading the way, and with comments [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=81.48s)]
*  like this by Democrats, we will just leave them in the dust in future elections. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY7F3Vwv_k&t=87.44s)]
