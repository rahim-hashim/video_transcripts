# Sean Hannity: They want Americans to see as little of Biden as possible
**Fox News:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM)
*  Now, also tonight, we are less than six months away, 182 days to be exact, till the 2024 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=0.0s)]
*  election. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=6.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, by the way, is once again stuck in a Manhattan courtroom, where a Biden donor [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=7.96s)]
*  posing as an impartial judge, with the statute of limitations that have long expired, whose [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=13.8s)]
*  family is compromised, as we've pointed out repeatedly on this program, is now threatening [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=20.6s)]
*  to unilaterally lock up former President Trump tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=25.76s)]
*  Alina Javah, House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jim Jordan will weigh in. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=29.72s)]
*  And also, Jim Jordan will weigh in on the issue of, oh, maybe evidence was tampered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=34.32s)]
*  with, and that being in the Florida case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  But while a far-left judge has now forced Donald Trump off the campaign trail, his opponent, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=41.4s)]
*  Joe Biden, has been sidelined by his own mental and physical limitations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=46.8s)]
*  The Biden campaign announcing that Joe's speeches will now be shorter moving forward. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  You see, they want Americans to see as little of Joe Biden as possible, and frankly, for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=58.24s)]
*  good reasons. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=63.0s)]
*  He is weak. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=64.0s)]
*  He is frail. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=65.4s)]
*  He is not cognitively strong enough to handle what are the rigors of her campaign, let alone [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=66.64s)]
*  be president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=72.68s)]
*  In fact, a horde of White House staffers now are surrounding Joe Biden whenever he walks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=73.68s)]
*  either to Marine One or away from Marine One. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=80.08s)]
*  Of course, they want to hide his dottering shuffle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=86.64s)]
*  Now the big-boy stares are out of question on Air Force One. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  Joe always takes the short steps up to Air Force One after a series of embarrassing falls. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=93.36s)]
*  Biden is also relying on what the White House is calling maximum-stability sneakers to help [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=99.24s)]
*  keep him upright. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=105.24s)]
*  Everyone around him knows that he is a physical and mental mess, and all of them are trying [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=107.36s)]
*  to cover it up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=113.3s)]
*  Joe Biden is not well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  He has no business being president, much less running for reelection. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=116.48s)]
*  I don't think he can handle being a Walmart greeter because I don't think he can remember [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=120.32s)]
*  where the varying departments would be. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=125.36s)]
*  So despite working to limit Joe Biden's public exposure, well, there's only so much staffers [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=127.72s)]
*  can do to keep Joe from making a complete fool of himself. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=132.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=135.88s)]
*  It's an honor to have so many friends and fans with us here today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=136.88s)]
*  They include Secretary of Defense Austin, a proud West Point grad himself. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=140.16s)]
*  You can clap. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=145.9s)]
*  We also join Bromley's football's biggest fans, Bill and Steve of the radio show, Crawdads' [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=146.9s)]
*  Countdown to Kickoff. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=153.3s)]
*  And we finally have Coach Jeff Munken, who once again led the Black Knights back to the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=155.22s)]
*  White House again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=163.82s)]
*  Where are you, Coach? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=165.66s)]
*  Now many of these cadets are going to have to hear me twice, so I'm going to make this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=169.58s)]
*  because I'm getting the honor of speaking again at West Point's commencement. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=173.62s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise that Biden is now down in almost every major poll. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=178.62s)]
*  Look at the Rasmussen poll. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=184.26s)]
*  It has Joe Biden now losing by double digits. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=185.5s)]
*  He's down by 10, but it's not just Joe Biden's physical and mental decline weighing him down. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  According to a brand new ABC poll, voters trust Donald Trump by an eight point margin [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=194.06s)]
*  when it comes to law and order and crime and safety. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=199.66s)]
*  Trump is up 17 points on immigration, seven points on America's standing in the world, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=203.18s)]
*  14 points on inflation and the economy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=208.94s)]
*  And Democratic strategist James Carville, remember he once famously said, it's the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=211.82s)]
*  economy, stupid. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=216.26s)]
*  Well, that's what decides elections. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=217.66s)]
*  Another poll from Gallup now shows that Americans' confidence in Biden's economic stewardship [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=220.26s)]
*  is now historically low. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=225.78s)]
*  Americans are now living under one of the most painful inflationary periods in history, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  and each day keeps getting worse. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=233.42s)]
*  Every year it keeps getting worse. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=235.61999999999998s)]
*  Prices keep getting higher. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=237.33999999999997s)]
*  And one key reason for economic decline, the Biden White House is filled with, well, frankly, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=239.42s)]
*  unqualified idiots. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=244.98s)]
*  For example, Jared Bernstein is the chairman of Joe Biden's Council on Economic Advisors. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  He's a proud graduate of the Manhattan School of Music. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=253.33999999999997s)]
*  He has a bachelor's degree in fine arts, not economics. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  He also earned a master's degree in social work, another master's degree in philosophy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=260.7s)]
*  and a PhD in social welfare. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=267.02000000000004s)]
*  Needless to say that Joe Biden's chief economic advisor doesn't know pretty much a damn thing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=269.74s)]
*  about economics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=274.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=275.74s)]
*  The government definitely prints money and it definitely lends that money, which is why [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=277.5s)]
*  The government definitely prints money and then it lends that money by selling bonds. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=282.98s)]
*  Is that what they do? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=289.14s)]
*  There is no question that the government prints money and then it uses that money to... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=290.14s)]
*  So, yeah, I guess I'm just... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=296.58s)]
*  I can't really talk. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=303.42s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=304.42s)]
*  I don't know what they're talking about, like, because it's like the government clearly [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=305.42s)]
*  prints money. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=311.06s)]
*  It does it all the time and it clearly borrows. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=312.3s)]
*  Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this debt and deficit conversation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=314.66s)]
*  So I don't think there's anything confusing there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=317.42s)]
*  Nothing confusing there? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=324.62s)]
*  Nothing made sense there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=326.1s)]
*  No wonder the economy is a complete mess. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=327.74s)]
*  It wasn't so awful for 60% of Americans living paycheck-in-paycheck. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=329.74s)]
*  It would be funny, but there's nothing funny about how people have to live. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=334.02s)]
*  The chairman of Biden's Council on Economic Advisers, well, doesn't understand inflation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=338.02s)]
*  at all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=343.5s)]
*  The government prints money. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=344.5s)]
*  That's all you know? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=345.9s)]
*  But let not your heart be troubled. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=346.94s)]
*  Your vice president is also on the case. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=348.38s)]
*  The Biden campaign is now sending out Vice President Harris to brag about the virtues [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=351.14s)]
*  of Bidonomics. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=356.1s)]
*  When we were told last week they were going to get off the topic of Bidonomics. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=357.1s)]
*  But according to this administration, your life has never been better. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=361.06s)]
*  They keep telling you that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=365.34s)]
*  No matter how you truly feel, no matter how difficult these times are. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  Of course, many Americans are ready for this national nightmare to be over. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=370.98s)]
*  That is why there is virtually no enthusiasm for Joe Biden on the campaign trail. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=375.3s)]
*  Of course, it is a very different story for Donald Trump. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=383.86s)]
*  Massive crowds, massive enthusiasm, pretty much everywhere he goes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwXi58JMwWM&t=396.66s)]
