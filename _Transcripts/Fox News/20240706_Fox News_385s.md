# Sen. John Kennedy: Biden is politically 'as dead as fried chicken'
**Fox News:** [July 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U)
*  and a senator, John Kennedy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Senator Kennedy, this is a big deal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=2.16s)]
*  that one of your Democratic colleagues, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=4.84s)]
*  Senator Warner, is having this meeting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  When Biden was asked about this, he said, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=9.34s)]
*  oh, that's just one senator, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=11.3s)]
*  but it sounds like a lot of senators have concerns. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And I'm wondering, you work with these senators every day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=16.44s)]
*  Do you think their concerns were assuaged tonight? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=18.98s)]
*  I'm not sure, Kayleigh, that interviews [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=21.48s)]
*  like the president gave tonight matter much at this juncture. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=30.68s)]
*  You can't make this catwalk backwards. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=35.72s)]
*  People saw what they saw in that 90-minute debate, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=38.86s)]
*  and I think most of them think that it's only a matter [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  of time before President Biden stumbles again, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  because they understand that old age doesn't get better, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=49.46s)]
*  it gets worse. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=53.76s)]
*  Fairly or unfairly, I think most Americans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=56.04s)]
*  have made up their minds. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=60.14s)]
*  I think they have concluded that President Biden is old, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=62.22s)]
*  that he is likely suffering from some form [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=67.62s)]
*  of neurodegenerative disease, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=70.56s)]
*  that he's suffered from it for a while, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=74.56s)]
*  and that the White House and many members [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=77.94s)]
*  of the media-industrial complex have covered it up, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=81.34s)]
*  and that cover-up has been toxic, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=86.02s)]
*  in my opinion, for what it's worth. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=89.48s)]
*  Politically, I think President Biden, politically, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=93.36s)]
*  is as dead as fried chicken. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=99.5s)]
*  He can quit, he can be replaced. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=101.26s)]
*  Let me just finish my thought. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=105.54s)]
*  Or he can run and lose. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  You can't successfully run for President of the United States [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  when your campaign slogan is, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  I'm only senile some of the time, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=117.1s)]
*  as one commentator pointed out today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=120.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  The thought that comes to mind, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  as I'm listening to you speak, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  is what are his advisors telling him? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=129.84s)]
*  Because there is this moment where George Stephanopoulos said, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=131.98s)]
*  you have a 36% approval rating, Mr. President, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=135.0s)]
*  and he looked at him with bewilderment, saying, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  no, I don't. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=141.0s)]
*  And yet, this comes the same day that 538 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=142.7s)]
*  put out the average approval rating of the president, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  hit its lowest point of his presidency, right at 36%. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  So are people just telling him what he wants to hear? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=153.26s)]
*  Well, look, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=158.72s)]
*  you shouldn't look to Washington, D.C. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=160.52s)]
*  for wisdom or comfort at this difficult time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=166.8s)]
*  As you know, most people in Washington, D.C., [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=170.4s)]
*  they'll unplug your life support [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  in order to charge their cell phone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=178.4s)]
*  Most people in Washington, D.C., right now, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=182.34s)]
*  are worried about how the president's problems [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=184.28s)]
*  are going to impact them personally. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=187.98s)]
*  I'm more interested in what the American people think. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=191.22s)]
*  And I don't take any joy in having to say all of this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=195.66s)]
*  This is a difficult time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=199.46s)]
*  But let me say it again. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=203.02s)]
*  People saw what they saw in that 90-minute debate, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=204.76s)]
*  and they're very concerned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=210.04s)]
*  They are very concerned. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=213.62s)]
*  I do want to play a little bit more, Senator Kennedy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  This was another disconnect from reality that we heard [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  about what happened at the debate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=222.28s)]
*  and what President Trump did. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=225.18s)]
*  How quickly did it come to you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=227.18s)]
*  that you were having that bad night? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=230.9s)]
*  Well, Kenan was having a bad night [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=233.06s)]
*  when I realized that even when I was answering a question, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=234.62s)]
*  even though I turned his mic off, he was still shouting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=239.34s)]
*  And I let it distract me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=242.46s)]
*  I'm not blaming him for that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=244.66000000000003s)]
*  But I realized that I just wasn't in control. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=246.62s)]
*  I watched the whole debate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=251.46s)]
*  I never saw President Trump shouting in a microphone [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=253.16s)]
*  that wouldn't let him shout. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we would hear his shouting in Biden's microphone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=259.1s)]
*  That just didn't happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=261.3s)]
*  Well, look, actually, as we all know, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=265.1s)]
*  the microphones were cut off [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=267.54s)]
*  when it wasn't the speaker's turn. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=269.7s)]
*  And I don't really understand [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=272.46s)]
*  what President Biden was referring to. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=273.9s)]
*  I do think that the White House is doing their president, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  our president, a disservice tonight. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  The White House says that, well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  they're like Kevin Bacon at the end of Animal House. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  All is well, don't panic. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  We've been transparent the entire time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=295.26s)]
*  This White House, they wouldn't know transparency [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=298.96s)]
*  if it jumped up and yodeled and bit him in the butt. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=302.42s)]
*  There has been a cover-up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=306.3s)]
*  And many members of the media have participated in it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=308.5s)]
*  And now some members of the media, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  they're running around going, we're dumbfounded. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  We never saw any sign of this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, and they're asking, is the president, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  can he stand for reelection? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=327.54s)]
*  His own Justice Department a few months ago [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  said that he's not even competent to stand trial. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=334.66s)]
*  What parachute did these, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=339.14s)]
*  what planet did these people parachute in from? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  The American people may be poorer under President Biden, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=344.5s)]
*  but they're not stupid. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=347.54s)]
*  And their concerns and suspicions have been confirmed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  They have been, and I'll never forget, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=356.94s)]
*  it was the Vice President, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  in the wake of that, her report you referenced, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=360.34s)]
*  who came in and vouched for the mental acuity [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  of President Biden. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=365.06s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, always such a way with words [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=366.26s)]
*  and so vivid in your language. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8QewoJec5U&t=369.85999999999996s)]
