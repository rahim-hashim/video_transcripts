# Judge Jeanine: Here's the problem about Kamala Harris
**Fox News:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU)
*  Here with reaction, the host of Here's the Deal with Kellyanne on FoxNation.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=0.0s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway, along with co-host of The Five, Judge Jeanine Pirro. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=4.82s)]
*  Great to have you both. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=10.6s)]
*  Judge, there's nothing about her campaign at this point that is real. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=11.6s)]
*  I mean, oh, yeah, I was all against fracking. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=14.48s)]
*  I wanted to ban it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=19.36s)]
*  I wanted to ban drilling. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=20.36s)]
*  I wanted gun confiscation and mandatory buybacks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=22.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I want Medicare for All and elimination of health insurance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=25.52s)]
*  Oh, never mind. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  I don't believe anything that I've said in my own words. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  That's a, you know, Houdini would be proud. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=32.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=35.64s)]
*  Well, here's the problem. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=36.64s)]
*  A lot of America does not know Kamala Harris. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  And so it is to her advantage to be a blank slate. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=41.4s)]
*  She can then represent to the people and say, I'm against banning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=45.16s)]
*  I want the border to be secure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=49.32s)]
*  I have fought as a prosecutor. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=51.4s)]
*  But all that is make-believe stuff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  Because we all know, just as that sheriff said from that presser several years ago when [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=56.64s)]
*  she was the attorney general, she had nothing to do with the case other than show up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=61.72s)]
*  She wouldn't even shake hands with anyone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=66.16s)]
*  She showed up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=68.08s)]
*  She did the press. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=69.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris is someone who believes in open borders. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=70.48s)]
*  She believes in defunding police. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  She believes in no cash bail. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  And she also believes in closing every migrant detention center. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=78.92s)]
*  And here's the problem for everyday Americans. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=83.14s)]
*  If you want law and order, if you want your business to survive, then there cannot be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=86.94s)]
*  crime like the crime that Sean just talked about with these individuals coming in from [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=91.66s)]
*  foreign countries not vetted, raping, murdering women, young children. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=97.28s)]
*  And what we've got in America right now are sanctuary cities that are supported by Kamala [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=103.1s)]
*  Harris and her pal there, Tim Walz, her VP candidate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=107.98s)]
*  And nothing, none of this is clear to the American people, which is why she's not speaking. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  If we can just show her this happy vibe, isn't she wonderful, time for woman nonsense, then [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=118.74s)]
*  she has a chance to win without the American people knowing what she stands for. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=125.46s)]
*  I contend, Kellyanne, she cannot win if the American people are fully informed about her [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=132.06s)]
*  positions in her own words. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=138.9s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=140.74s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=141.74s)]
*  But who's going to inform them? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=142.74s)]
*  Us on this show? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=144.38s)]
*  Well, certainly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=146.34s)]
*  But she's not going to inform them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=148.22s)]
*  She's not going to sit for an interview. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=150.22s)]
*  Maybe she'll do a debate, but that'll be a lot of pablum and pie in the sky promises [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=152.06s)]
*  also. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=155.9s)]
*  Look, I do think you're onto something. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=156.9s)]
*  The underlying fundamentals and the electoral map still benefit Donald Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  This is his race to lose. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  And part of it is because Kamala Harris has been Joe Biden's number two. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=163.38s)]
*  She needs to eat and own all the failings and flailings policy-wise. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=167.46s)]
*  I would say fewer insults, more insights. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  Let's not talk about whether her gender, her race, this, that and the other is an asset [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=175.18s)]
*  or a liability. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=178.9s)]
*  Let's look at the rest of the balance sheet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=180.18s)]
*  This is somebody who just this month should have to face hard questions about her role [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  in two big events. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Two years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act, which did not reduce inflation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Even today it says housing is up 30 percent, groceries are up 20 percent, everything's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=192.22s)]
*  way up, except our morale. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=195.58s)]
*  Also, the end of this month is the third anniversary of the chaotic, unnecessary, irrational withdrawal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=198.18s)]
*  from Afghanistan. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=203.34s)]
*  You want this woman to be commander in chief, so these things need to be laid out, but the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  judge is correct. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  And our fears are real. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=210.62s)]
*  That left to our own devices, Kamala Harris is just one big old blind date. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  And everybody's making her whatever they need her to be. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=217.34s)]
*  She's so good looking, she's so smart, she's so wealthy, she's so funny, she's close to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  her mom. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  She goes on really cool vacations, she'll never break your heart. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=226.28s)]
*  Everybody's making her what they need her to be. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=229.96s)]
*  She is defined. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=232.16s)]
*  To define her is to deter her. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=233.2s)]
*  And this has to be won or lost on policy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=236.64s)]
*  Last point, every time Kamala Harris stands up and says something like, I'm going to give [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=239.72s)]
*  an economic speech, I'm going to roll out my plan for the border, she needs to be fact [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  checked immediately. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=248.58s)]
*  That comes from people who are not yet in office, not somebody who's the sitting vice [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=250.16s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=254.52s)]
*  You know, if you look at the border, it's wide open, Judge. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=257.36s)]
*  If you look at her defund, dismantle, no bail law, supporting that bail fund in the summer [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=260.68s)]
*  of 2020 during the rioting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=266.68s)]
*  If you look at record inflation that was anything but transitory, the high price of energy, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=268.64s)]
*  electricity, you name it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=275.0s)]
*  And then of course eliminate, we need the courage to eliminate the word radical Islamic [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=277.2s)]
*  terrorism and to eliminate the words illegal alien. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got to be courageous, Judge. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=286.12s)]
*  I want you to denounce those words right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  Take the stand. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=289.88s)]
*  Stand with Kamala. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=290.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=291.88s)]
*  Well, the problem with Kamala and, you know, I think that that Kellyanne is very, very [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=292.88s)]
*  accurate when she says that until we get that information out, the American public is not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=298.32s)]
*  going to know it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  And she's doing everything she can to hide behind that that mask that she's put on. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  She's trying to run as a moderate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=311.56s)]
*  Because the American people want a moderate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=312.56s)]
*  But the American people should understand that Joe Biden ran as a moderate also. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=314.44s)]
*  But he has allowed 10, 12, 15 million illegals unvetted into our country, in a country where [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=318.74s)]
*  there are sanctuary cities and sanctuary states promoted by Kamala and her vice presidential [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  candidate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  He's an individual who believes in all of this that we Americans have to pay for. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  She is not someone who is capable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=339.24s)]
*  Kellyanne talked about Afghanistan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=341.2s)]
*  I can't imagine her sitting in a room with any of the world leaders without them looking [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  at her and saying, should I be afraid of this woman? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=348.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=350.92s)]
*  What we've got is a woman who is undefined. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=351.92s)]
*  And as a result of being undefined, America doesn't have a footing right now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  But Judge, let me take a little issue with that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=358.36s)]
*  I don't think she's undefined. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=359.92s)]
*  I think all this information is out there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=361.64s)]
*  I've got on my website, Hannity.com, the Kamala files, the Tim Walz files. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=364.0s)]
*  All of this is out there in their own words. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=368.76s)]
*  So she really has defined herself. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=371.56s)]
*  It's her trying to run away from who she is. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=375.0s)]
*  And will the media? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=377.88s)]
*  Will the media hold her to it? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd0hJ8UuPU&t=380.06s)]
