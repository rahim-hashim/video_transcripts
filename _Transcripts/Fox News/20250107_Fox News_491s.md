# Hannity: This is why America elected Donald Trump
**Fox News:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc)
*  Tonight, we begin with a preview into what will be, frankly, an unpredictable, exciting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=0.0s)]
*  busy and transformative next four years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=5.84s)]
*  Buckle up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=9.0s)]
*  It's going to be a great ride. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=10.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump in front of a podium. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=11.44s)]
*  Imagine this, a president. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=13.88s)]
*  No scripts, no notes, no preselected questions, just bold, out-of-the-box ideas that you usually [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=15.52s)]
*  won't get from the D.C. swamp. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=22.04s)]
*  President-elect Trump has made plans, a commitment to put America first. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=24.44s)]
*  Our nation's enemies and allies have all been put on notice. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=27.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=31.6s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=32.6s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=37.96s)]
*  East. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=42.8s)]
*  Now, Steve Wittkopf, who was in that video, he will join us coming up later in the program. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=43.8s)]
*  So more on Trump's maximum pressure campaign against the terrorists that are now holding [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=49.4s)]
*  American citizens in captivity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=54.5s)]
*  They have since October 7, 2023, freed the hostages, or they will be held to pay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=57.48s)]
*  But first, more from today's wide-ranging press conference, including a big new plan [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=63.76s)]
*  to rebrand the Gulf of—well, while holding our neighbors to the south and to the north [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=68.68s)]
*  accountable. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=75.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=76.48s)]
*  You decide. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=77.48s)]
*  Changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=79.36s)]
*  ring that covers a lot of territory. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=86.48s)]
*  The Gulf of America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=89.12s)]
*  What a beautiful name. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's appropriate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=92.2s)]
*  It's appropriate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=94.04s)]
*  And Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  They can stop them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada, because Canada, they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=102.44s)]
*  come through Canada, too. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=107.48s)]
*  And the drugs that are coming through are at record numbers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=108.48s)]
*  Record numbers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=113.08s)]
*  Can you imagine the legacy media today watching that, probably having collectively a massive [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=114.08s)]
*  coronary? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=119.28s)]
*  Oh, the Gulf of America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=120.28s)]
*  Actually, it does have a nice ring to it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=122.28s)]
*  Donald Trump, he was only getting started. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  It was the president-elect's message to Panama, home to the critically important Panama Canal, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=126.92s)]
*  now under the influence of China, according to many reports. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=133.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=137.56s)]
*  The Panama Canal is a disgrace, what took place at the Panama Canal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=138.56s)]
*  So the Panama Canal is under discussion with them right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=142.92s)]
*  They violated every aspect of the agreement, and it's they morally violated it also. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=146.24s)]
*  And they want our help because it's leaking and not in good repair. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=154.56s)]
*  And they want us to give three billion dollars to help fix it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=160.04s)]
*  I said, well, why don't you get the money from China? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=163.32s)]
*  Because China's basically taking it over. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  China's at both ends of the Panama Canal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=168.4s)]
*  China's running the Panama Canal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  They've overcharged our ships, overcharged our Navy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=172.84s)]
*  And then when they need repair money, they come to the United States to put it up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=177.44s)]
*  We get nothing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=180.8s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=182.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, he also has big plans for another strategic area of the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=185.28s)]
*  The first floating an idea to buy mineral rich Greenland from Denmark a few years back. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, Trump's vision now could actually be a reality. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=195.48s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump Jr. visited that island to share his father's plans. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=198.76s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=203.44s)]
*  This looks like the runway Santa Claus would land at. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=204.92s)]
*  Guys, we're here in Greenland. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  This is the founder, 1721. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=213.64s)]
*  That yellow house with the red top, that was his original spot. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=218.6s)]
*  That's where he moved. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  This is where it all started out here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=223.16s)]
*  Just incredible scenery. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=225.28s)]
*  Super cool stuff. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=229.84s)]
*  Don Jr. will join us with more details on his trip to Greenland. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=232.92s)]
*  That's coming up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=236.56s)]
*  But first, at today's presser, Donald Trump also had a message for the current president, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden, and his plan to ruin, destroy America's oil and gas industry. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=242.4s)]
*  You know, that which would make America the single most energy rich country on the face [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=248.44s)]
*  of the earth and his continued attempts to sabotage the incoming administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=253.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  They take 625 million acres and they essentially landmark it so you can't ever drill there [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=259.44s)]
*  again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=265.92s)]
*  Well, we're going to be drilling soon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=266.92s)]
*  Couldn't believe the size of it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=267.92s)]
*  I mean, you put down a map and put this up, it's just massive. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=269.2s)]
*  And remember that that's worth probably, I mean, I've had estimates, 40 to 50 trillion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=274.88s)]
*  dollars. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=281.16s)]
*  That's more than our national debt. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=282.16s)]
*  Essentially he's thrown it away. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  He's thrown it away. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=285.56s)]
*  He's taken 50 trillion dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=287.48s)]
*  So if we owe 35 trillion, he's taken 50 trillion dollars of value and thrown it right out the window. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=291.76s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump will take it back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  You'll pay less for gasoline. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  Diesel prices will come down. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  That means the cost of transporting everything you buy and every store you go to will also [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=305.8s)]
*  go down. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=310.36s)]
*  That will help inflation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=311.36s)]
*  That will help the economy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=312.48s)]
*  That will lower interest rates. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=313.6s)]
*  And that will put Americans on a better financial footing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=315.56s)]
*  The president-elect also addressing Biden's plan to sell off border wall materials for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=318.8s)]
*  mere pennies on the dollar in his final days in office. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=324.04s)]
*  Really, Joe? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=327.76s)]
*  Are you that bitter? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=328.76s)]
*  Are you that angry? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=329.76s)]
*  Are you that petty? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=331.0s)]
*  Are you that small? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  Because you know Trump would buy a new wall and we'd all have to pay for it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=333.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=337.44s)]
*  We won the case on the wall. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=338.88s)]
*  You know, they tried to sell the wall for five cents on the dollar, by the way. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=339.88s)]
*  And we had, fortunately, a judge that stopped that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  But they were already discarding the wall. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=348.24s)]
*  And fortunately we had a very smart judge that stopped it cold. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=350.64s)]
*  I think he called for an investigation too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=354.2s)]
*  And he should. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=356.96s)]
*  But think of it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  They were selling the wall that was exactly the wall that the Border Patrol wanted, that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=359.48s)]
*  was designed by them, steel, concrete, rebar, exactly as they want. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=364.0s)]
*  Very heavy steel, very powerful steel, hard to cut. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=370.56s)]
*  This is why you, the American people, this is why you went to the polls in record numbers. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  This is why America elected Donald Trump. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=379.92s)]
*  His energy, creativity, his out-of-the-box thinking, his commitment to fight for the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=383.32s)]
*  American people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=388.68s)]
*  That means all of you, 24-7, 365. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=389.68s)]
*  He's not going to be on the beach in Delaware every weekend. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=392.28s)]
*  And even though Donald Trump is not back in office yet, well, the wins, they're starting [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=396.32s)]
*  to pile up. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=401.94s)]
*  At the presser, Donald Trump announcing a new $20 billion investment from a company [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=402.94s)]
*  out of Dubai. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=407.36s)]
*  Now, this will create thousands and thousands of high-paying, career American jobs in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SagbHjYomc&t=408.36s)]
