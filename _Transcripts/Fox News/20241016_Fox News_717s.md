# Kellyanne Conway: Trump has a chance to ‘run the tables’ in November
**Fox News:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q)
*  Here with reaction project 21 chairman Horace Cooper former senior advisor to President Trump Stephen Miller Fox News contributor Kellyann Conway [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright Kellyann three way three weeks from tonight. It is election night in America's game time and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=8.64s)]
*  Where do you see the race right now? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=16.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is winning and he has an opportunity to have what I call a narrow landslide meaning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=20.7s)]
*  He can actually run the tables and win all seven swing states [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=25.7s)]
*  He can win them narrowly, but their winner take all because it's the electoral college. Why he's barnstorming and blitzing those swing states [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=28.8s)]
*  He's going to the 22 counties or so where this race will be decided and he feels [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=35.46s)]
*  Confident enough in his running mate Jay DeVance to go have his own separate schedule [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=39.94s)]
*  So they are double teaming these swing states and then Trump's doing smart things like going to iconic venues [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=44.54s)]
*  Madison Square Garden Coachella, California [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  Why is he there the media are asking those aren't swing states because he's Donald Trump and he can fill up those venues and inspire people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=52.68s)]
*  The other thing that's going on is the left has no compelling message [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=58.84s)]
*  No convincing persuasive messenger and they have a lot of money money and politics is distorted [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=63.24s)]
*  It makes the Harris campaign think that she doesn't have to be that good and she can still win [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=69.08s)]
*  So what turned was started out Sean is penetrating the voters with ads has become penetration has become [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=73.68s)]
*  Saturation is and is on its way to inundation that angers the voters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=80.84s)]
*  They stop getting upset about the subject matter of your ads and they start getting mad at the sponsor of the ads two quick statistics [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=84.84s)]
*  That's how the tale here [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both won [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=92.64000000000001s)]
*  93 percent of the female black vote Kamala Harris a black woman is at 71 percent [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=96.76s)]
*  18 to 44 black men Barack Obama had 81 percent in November of 2012 Kamala Harris has 41 percent [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  She has one half the number that Barack Obama had [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=110.36s)]
*  So how does she make that up among non college educated households among white households that don't say abortion is their top one or two issue? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=113.52s)]
*  How does she make that she's bleeding out among union households younger people and I'm gonna say blacks [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=121.6s)]
*  Hispanics and also Jewish voters [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=128.64s)]
*  I'm mentioning to you groups that Donald Trump does not need to get anywhere near 50 percent to become the next president [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=130.92s)]
*  I think he's in a great position to go right through [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Far beyond 300 electoral votes and the last thing I wanted to say is that registration numbers are incredible [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=141.48s)]
*  Nevada in North Carolina in Pennsylvania the Republicans have really caught up the whole get out the vote voter education [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Early early voting all of those investments are paying off now. That's how you win this tough technical tactical trench warfare [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=154.48s)]
*  Let me ask you Horace if I can I think the comma has been horrible in these interviews [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=163.0s)]
*  And she wants to promise you know student loan forgiveness to those stupid 18 to 24 year old kids that live in dormitories [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=168.48s)]
*  That she had talked about in the past, but now she wants to give $25,000 down payments now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=175.76s)]
*  She's offering programs just to African Americans. She's not doing well as Kellyanne was pointing out [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Demographically with African American men so she sends out Barack Obama that didn't work particularly. Well [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=187.4s)]
*  He came off as somewhat condescending [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=193.32s)]
*  Accusing African American men perhaps of being sexist in their thinking and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  And now she's offering all of these programs reparations. She will examine she said earlier today [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=201.26s)]
*  It didn't work out with Gretchen Whitmer [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=207.42s)]
*  I mean a huge controversy was she making fun or mocking Christians and Catholics [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=209.5s)]
*  Obama didn't work out particularly well Bill Clinton even went as far as to say that Lake and Riley had we had vetting at the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=215.66s)]
*  Border would likely be alive today. I don't think that was particularly helpful [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=222.3s)]
*  So I don't see that her surrogates are helping her that much either [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=225.58s)]
*  Last year my book came out put y'all back in chains in which I predicted that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  Black America was sick and tired of the hoax plan the latest hoax is apparently [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  We're going to give a trillion plus dollars in payments calling it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=243.3s)]
*  Reparations there is no scenario where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=248.76s)]
*  some kind of grant of hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars per person is ever [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=253.12s)]
*  Actually going to happen black Americans have realized this and that is the reason why [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=259.64s)]
*  So many black Americans are asking for basic answers. What are you going to do about inflation? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=267.48s)]
*  What are you going to do about the crime problem and what are you going to do about our country being? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  overwhelmed by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=282.88s)]
*  Immigrants that are not supposed to be in this country [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=284.64s)]
*  taking school resources and other social services that actual American taxpayers have provided for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=288.36s)]
*  disproportionately these [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=298.44s)]
*  radical [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=300.0s)]
*  policies harm [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=301.08s)]
*  Black Americans now I grew up in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=302.64s)]
*  Texas where we have had the death penalty where we hold people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=306.24s)]
*  Accountable my brother was a corrections officer on death row [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=311.64s)]
*  We know first hand that there must [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=317.44s)]
*  Absolutely be accountability what we're recently learning here looks like Willie Horton [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=322.08s)]
*  2024 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=329.88s)]
*  when you see a candidate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=331.04s)]
*  Advocating benefits like a sex change operation for a brutal killer [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=334.32s)]
*  They ought to be already buried under the gel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  But apparently the progressive answer is just the opposite black Americans in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=345.16s)]
*  Particular as well as most of America find these [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=351.12s)]
*  Radical policies not to their liking not something that they can embrace in one last point in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=355.56s)]
*  2020 black [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=363.52s)]
*  Americans people often think black Americans must be liberal because so many are registered as Democrats black [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=365.52s)]
*  Americans are moderates and centrist by and large and they picked [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=373.56s)]
*  Joe Biden because there were so many [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=379.24s)]
*  Crazies that were running and there has been a huge level of disappointment that he ended up [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=382.96s)]
*  Embracing all of the radical policies that black America rejects [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=391.4s)]
*  You know Stephen you look at the insanity of this convicted murderer sex change operation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=397.84s)]
*  out in California [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  Courtesy of taxpayer money thanks to Kamala Harris [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=407.0s)]
*  Then you look at her position on the border and you can look at our New Green Deal position [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  You can look at eliminating health care. You can look at mandatory gun buybacks [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=414.4s)]
*  You can look at defund dismantle no bail laws, but this one in particular [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=418.47999999999996s)]

*  You that would include college education legal drivers licenses [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=429.64s)]
*  Sex change operations and then a path to citizenship earned path [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=433.92s)]
*  They call it that would be called amnesty where I'm from 12 and a half million people [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=438.52s)]
*  Including members of drug cartels gang members. We have Americans that have been murdered raped [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=442.92s)]
*  We have Americans victims of violent crime. It's costing the country billions of dollars [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=448.32s)]
*  Do people understand how bad this has gotten and what a national security threat? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=453.76s)]
*  This is we have known terrorists now in the country [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=458.72s)]
*  They know about them, but they don't know where they are and now we're gonna pay for sex change operations if they want them [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=461.66s)]
*  Well, this is why Donald Trump is now leading in the polls [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=469.54s)]
*  This is why Donald Trump is pulling ahead in this race because he's been going around the country [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=472.82s)]
*  Making all of these arguments laying out all these facts [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=477.18s)]
*  Like you just said he went to Aurora, Colorado and gave a speech for the ages [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=479.98s)]
*  documenting in painstaking detail how Kamala Harris imported a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=485.9s)]
*  Ruthless criminal syndicate from Venezuela into their community taking over their parks taking over their schools [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=490.74s)]
*  Taking over entire apartment complexes as you mentioned now [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=497.5s)]
*  We have this case where a convicted murderer is getting a free taxpayer funded sex change operation [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=501.4s)]
*  This is madness. This is beyond anything [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=508.74s)]
*  We've seen in the history of American politics [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=511.46s)]
*  Then she wants to give you legal aliens free housing free welfare free transportation free [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=513.42s)]
*  everything free education free [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=519.24s)]
*  lifetime Medicare and Social Security retirement benefits and of course full voting and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=522.36s)]
*  Citizenship rights and on top of all of that one crime after another committed by these criminal migrants including this new case of three [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=528.08s)]
*  Illegals that she released who sexually assaulted a 12 year old the amount of suffering and blood and misery on her hands is totally [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=534.88s)]
*  Disqualifying as Donald Trump has said anyone who would lead an invasion of their own country [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=543.48s)]
*  Cannot run to be president of that country you add to it the Green New Deal you add to it the largest proposed tax hike in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=548.12s)]
*  history you add to it a pledge to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=554.5999999999999s)]
*  Massively increase regulations on every single sector of the economy grinding growth to a halt you have a full-on [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=557.76s)]
*  Communist that is running for president who by the way also is pledged to abolish private health care and abolish fracking [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=565.16s)]
*  America must and will reject this insanity [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  You think I'll ask an exit question [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=574.76s)]
*  Do you think it is now penetrated into the consciousness of the American people how radical and extreme she is? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=577.48s)]
*  30 seconds each starting with you Kelly yet [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=585.6s)]
*  Yes, and she made a big mistake just not being part of the Biden-Harris agenda and saying the only change is really me [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=589.88s)]
*  My age my gender my race my generation [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=596.96s)]
*  She's trying too hard to change her position because she knows this country is now looking for border security doesn't want all these wars abroad [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q&t=600.64s)]
