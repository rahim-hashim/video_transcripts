# Sen. Lindsey Graham: Kamala ‘flunked’ the first test of being President
**Fox News:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y)
*  Here with the reaction, Senator Lindsey Graham, the great state of South Carolina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a question for Kamala Harris and other Democrats like Patty Murray and many of your [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=4.48s)]
*  colleagues, Senator, and idiots like George Clooney and his wife. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=9.76s)]
*  What part of murder, rape, kidnapping, torture, beheadings do they not understand? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=15.44s)]
*  Because this terror attack, if you extrapolate out Israel's population compared to ours, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=23.66s)]
*  that would be the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans in a day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=29.62s)]
*  What part of that is this wing of her party missing? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=33.7s)]
*  You know, that's a really good question. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=37.38s)]
*  Here's my view on this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=40.38s)]
*  Everybody who wants to kill the state of Israel and all the Jews and wipe it off the map wants [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=42.38s)]
*  to kill us too. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=48.06s)]
*  We're the great Satan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=49.82s)]
*  So I don't understand why we would pick a group of people who would actually want to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=51.52s)]
*  kill us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  Now, she's the de facto nominee for the Democratic Party in 2024. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  This is an astounding bad decision not to appear behind Bibi as vice president of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  This is a signal to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran that we literally do not have Bibi's back. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=69.46s)]
*  This is really her first major foreign policy decision, and she's gotten an F. She's so [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=75.74s)]
*  worried about the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party, she cannot sit behind the prime minister [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=82.42s)]
*  of Israel, our best ally in the region, one of the best in the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=89.42s)]
*  It's not only despicable, it's really a bad decision. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  She's thrown gasoline on the cause of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran by doing this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=98.7s)]
*  I take it a step further. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  In my view, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, when they would not support Israel's right to win [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=106.66s)]
*  their war against radical Islamic terrorists, Hamas attacked them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  Hamas killed their citizens, raped their citizens, beheaded their citizens, kidnapped their citizens. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=120.3s)]
*  That to me is a complete surrender. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=127.3s)]
*  Joe and Kamala surrendered in the war on terrorism, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=129.9s)]
*  They surrendered to the radical left. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=135.1s)]
*  This is what you need to understand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=137.58s)]
*  I wish everybody in America could watch her show. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=139.02s)]
*  She's the most liberal senator I've known since I've been in the Senate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=141.82s)]
*  She's the most liberal person in the history of America to ever receive a party's nomination [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  for president of the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=150.5s)]
*  She signed up for the Green New Deal, Medicare for All. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  There's no liberal horse that she won't ride. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=155.18s)]
*  So she's picked the radical left Hamas wing of the party. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=157.72s)]
*  She's afraid to offend them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=161.46s)]
*  She's more afraid of them than standing up for our friends in Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=163.5s)]
*  This is a chillingly bad decision. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=167.3s)]
*  It empowers the enemies of Israel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  It makes America weaker in the eyes of our allies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=171.8s)]
*  I cannot tell you, she flunked the first test of trying to be president of the United States [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=174.66s)]
*  by picking the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party, pleasing them more than standing behind [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  the prime minister of Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=185.46s)]
*  This is a chillingly bad decision. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=186.9s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  I know that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be making his way down to Palm Beach and meeting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=191.46s)]
*  with President Trump in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=196.5s)]
*  There's never been a president more supportive of Israel than Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=199.38s)]
*  You know, he moved, obviously, the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, its proper home. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  On every single level, he supported them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  And I'll even go a step further. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=217.46s)]
*  I don't think Hamas ever would have attacked Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=219.22s)]
*  I don't think Iran would have fired missiles into Israel had Donald Trump been president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=222.42s)]
*  One thing I can tell you is that, you know, I don't care if it's China, Iran, North [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=228.17999999999998s)]
*  Korea, Russia, they never feared Joe Biden. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  They did fear Donald Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=238.82s)]
*  They won't fear Kamala Harris. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=240.94s)]
*  They'll laugh at Kamala Harris because that's what she does half the time anyway. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  She giggles away, you know, her time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=249.06s)]
*  I don't think they'll take her seriously because I don't think she's a serious person. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=251.82s)]
*  Well, this decision she made not to appear as vice president behind Bibi when he addresses [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=256.5s)]
*  a joint session of Congress is a very poor decision, reinforcing to the world that she [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=263.3s)]
*  does not have Israel's back. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  If you give into aggression, you'll get more of it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=271.62s)]
*  The choice between Trump, Vance and Harris and somebody yet to be named on Israel is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=274.32s)]
*  clear as night and day. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=280.02s)]
*  It's also clear on the border, on inflation, on taxes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=281.7s)]
*  This is a right track, wrong track election. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=285.42s)]
*  70 percent of Americans believe we're on the wrong track. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=288.06s)]
*  If you believe that, you're right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=291.1s)]
*  If you think Harris is going to get back on the right track, you're very wrong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=292.66s)]
*  She is the face of wrong track policy in America. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=297.58s)]
*  She is not ready for this job. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=302.08s)]
*  She's been wrong at every turn about things that matter to you and your family. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=303.78s)]
*  And what she is about to do tomorrow by not showing up is going to make life much harder [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  for her friends in Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=313.58s)]
*  What does it say about the D.C. elites, the Pelosi, the Schumers of the world, the Hakeem [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  Jeffries of the world, the D.C. elites, the Nantucket elites? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  That would be the Obamas. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=326.06s)]
*  The Hollywood elites, the money elites, the George Clooney's of the world. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=327.54s)]
*  They have more power over the Democratic Party and the voters that went to the polls during [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=331.66s)]
*  these primaries to vote for Joe Biden. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=337.1s)]
*  They just get disenfranchised and nobody thinks twice about it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=339.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're afraid of the Hollywood crowd. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=342.9s)]
*  They're afraid of the Hamas wing, of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump and Vance are coming back and we're going to get the world straightened out pretty [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=348.62s)]
*  quick to our friends in Israel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=352.54s)]
*  Help is on the way. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=354.58s)]
*  Help is on the way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, this little sugar high that the left wing media is feeling and Democrats [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  are feeling, that's not going to last very long. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=362.14s)]
*  I can promise you that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=365.14s)]
*  All right, coming up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57fQVLL56Y&t=367.53999999999996s)]
