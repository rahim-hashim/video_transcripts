# Newt Gingrich: Democrats know they can't beat Trump
**Fox News:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4)
*  Action. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=1.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to talk about tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=3.72s)]
*  We have these protests in New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=6.46s)]
*  We have the battle—the last battle with Israel and Hamas in Ra'afah, hopefully the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=8.16s)]
*  last part of that battle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Then you have an economic adviser, chief economic adviser to the president that doesn't have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=16.72s)]
*  a clue about the economy, has no background, no expertise in the economy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=21.5s)]
*  You heard that answer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=25.8s)]
*  That's pretty chilling to me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=26.8s)]
*  Look, I think, Sean, if I had anyone comment about where we are, it's that those of us [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=29.8s)]
*  who are pro-Trump lack the imagination to understand how the other side intends to win. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  They have a very clear plan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=45.56s)]
*  It is to take Trump out of the race. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=48.24s)]
*  They don't think they can beat Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=50.8s)]
*  In fact, you hear more and more Democrats say openly they think that Trump would win. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=52.2s)]
*  And so, if you watch the judge in New York, the most important battlefield of this entire [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=58.54s)]
*  campaign is an appointed corrupt judge in New York who, I believe, is about to put Donald [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=64.02s)]
*  Trump in prison. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=72.1s)]
*  And that's a very dangerous thing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=73.96s)]
*  It's dangerous to our Constitution. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=76.62s)]
*  By what right does an appointed local judge put somebody who is the nominee of their party, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=79.38s)]
*  former president, in prison? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=86.38s)]
*  He's openly told us twice now, in two weeks, that it's going to happen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=88.42s)]
*  And I think it's very dangerous at the most basic of levels. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  Just ask yourself, what would it be like to be Trump in prison in New York? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=97.92s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I am personally more worried tonight about what I see emerging than anything [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  I've seen all year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=111.14s)]
*  They know they can't beat him if he's still here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  They know they have no answers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  They know that Biden's getting weaker and weaker. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=117.5s)]
*  They know that the whole situation's failing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=119.86s)]
*  And yet they are desperate to win. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=123.14s)]
*  And so I focus, as a historian, on what's possible when faced with a ruthless, corrupt [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=126.04s)]
*  enemy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  And you can tell this—and I say use the word enemy deliberately—these are not competitors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  They have taken a guy who was paid by the DNC in 2018 to be a political operative. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=138.66s)]
*  They took him out of the Justice Department, sent him up to lead the trial against Trump, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  and they will do whatever else they have to do to make sure that by election day, Donald [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump is not a competitor. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=156.54s)]
*  OK, this is a judge that donated to Joe Biden in 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  This is a judge. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=163.14s)]
*  Many, many questions have been raised about his own family, perhaps benefiting from the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=164.14s)]
*  outcome of this trial, his daughter in particular. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=168.94s)]
*  It's been reported pretty much everywhere. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=171.66s)]
*  And you have the issue of the statute of limitations have passed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=174.78s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I don't think anybody can tell you what is—what are the charges in this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=177.66s)]
*  case? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=183.58s)]
*  What is the second charge? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=184.58s)]
*  That hasn't even been told. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  We have a situation where a gag order exists, but only for one person. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=187.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, you have the lead—a witness for the prosecution is out there on TikTok [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=192.38s)]
*  asking for gifts, and nothing is done to stop or silence that person. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=197.74s)]
*  Can you explain to me how this kangaroo court is allowed to take place, and what is the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=203.94s)]
*  outcome if there's a guilty verdict? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  Will it be overturned on appeal before the election? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=211.5s)]
*  Well, it's not about appeal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=214.9s)]
*  I worry about what this judge will do to put Donald Trump at risk while the judicial system [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=218.94s)]
*  operates. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=225.3s)]
*  The problem is, lawyers keep pretending that the rule of law is involved here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=226.3s)]
*  You have a corrupt district attorney, a corrupt state attorney general, a corrupt judge, his [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=232.02s)]
*  daughter's making millions out of attacking Donald Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=237.18s)]
*  Now, this is not a—this is not hearsay. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=240.9s)]
*  You have a lawyer sent from the Justice Department, number three, a justice, to prosecute Trump, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  having been a Democratic National Committee consultant. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=250.66000000000003s)]
*  And in the middle of all this, we're supposed to pretend this is the rule of law. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=255.06s)]
*  This is not. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=259.54s)]
*  This is not the rule of law. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=261.18s)]
*  This is a corrupt, deliberate assault, worthy of Putin or worthy of Cuba or worthy of Venezuela. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=262.86s)]
*  And we'd better wake up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=270.3s)]
*  In an ideal world, the Supreme Court would proactively intervene, strip this judge of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  this case. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  Every major neutral lawyer has said, there is no case here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=278.88s)]
*  This is an absurdity. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=283.42s)]
*  And yet, we continue to grind forward and continue to pretend that this is about the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=285.54s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=291.22s)]
*  This is not. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=292.3s)]
*  This is a deliberate effort to, at a minimum, have a character assassination and, at a maximum, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=293.3s)]
*  put Donald J. Trump at genuine risk. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  And I think all of us ought to be aware that this judge has already told us twice, last [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=303.5s)]
*  week and this week, that he intends to put Trump in jail, and he's going to find an [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=308.54s)]
*  excuse and he's going to do it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=312.94s)]
*  And we had better have an answer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=315.18s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, that's a dire, dire warning for the entire country. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=318.38s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcHiHrP4pX4&t=322.9s)]
