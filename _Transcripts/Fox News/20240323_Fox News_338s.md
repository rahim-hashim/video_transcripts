# This news came as a shock to her and the world: Charlie Lankston
**Fox News:** [March 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE)
*  Welcome to Hannity Busy Friday News Night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=0.0s)]
*  My monologue coming up in just a minute, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=2.2s)]
*  but first, troubling news from across the pond. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=4.72s)]
*  After taking time away from public life for several months, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=7.36s)]
*  well, that led to rampant speculation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=11.28s)]
*  and salacious rumors and conspiracy theories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Well, we can confirm tonight the Princess of Wales, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=17.28s)]
*  Kate Middleton, she just announced [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=20.22s)]
*  that she has been diagnosed with cancer [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=22.48s)]
*  and is now undergoing chemotherapy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=26.36s)]
*  I wanted to take this opportunity [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=27.88s)]
*  to say thank you personally [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=29.64s)]
*  for all the wonderful messages of support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=31.56s)]
*  and for your understanding [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=33.8s)]
*  whilst I've been recovering from surgery. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=35.6s)]
*  It has been an incredibly tough couple of months [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=38.88s)]
*  for our entire family, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=41.16s)]
*  but I've had a fantastic medical team [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=42.96s)]
*  who have taken great care of me for which I'm so grateful. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=44.96s)]
*  In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=49.18s)]
*  and at the time, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=53.06s)]
*  it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=54.24s)]
*  The surgery was successful, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=57.88s)]
*  however, tests after the operation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=59.84s)]
*  found cancer had been present. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  My medical team therefore advised [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=64.84s)]
*  that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  and I'm now in the early stages of that treatment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=70.06s)]
*  This, of course, came as a huge shock, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=74.44s)]
*  and Willem and I have been doing everything we can [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=77.12s)]
*  to process and manage this privately [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=79.68s)]
*  for the sake of our young family. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=82.2s)]
*  As you can imagine, this has taken time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=85.12s)]
*  It has taken me time to recover for major surgery [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  in order to start my treatment, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=91.28s)]
*  but most importantly, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  it has taken us time to explain everything [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  to George, Charlotte and Louis [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=97.12s)]
*  in a way that's appropriate for them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=99.16s)]
*  and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=101.2s)]
*  As I've said to them, I am well, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=105.28s)]
*  and getting stronger every day [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=107.52s)]
*  by focusing on the things that will help me heal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=109.0s)]
*  in my mind, body and spirits. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  Having Willem by my side [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=114.2s)]
*  is a source of comfort and reassurance too, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=115.64s)]
*  as is the love, support and kindness [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=118.32s)]
*  that has been shown by so many of you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=120.44s)]
*  It means so much to us both. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=122.88s)]
*  We hope that you'll understand that as a family, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  we now need some time, space and privacy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=129.56s)]
*  while I complete my treatment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=132.76s)]
*  My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=136.28s)]
*  and I look forward to being back when I'm able, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=139.28s)]
*  but for now I must focus on making a full recovery. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=142.0s)]
*  At this time, I'm also thinking of all those [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=147.32s)]
*  whose lives have been affected by cancer. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=150.16s)]
*  For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=153.16s)]
*  please do not lose faith or hope. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=156.88s)]
*  You are not alone. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=159.64s)]
*  42, three young children. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=162.32s)]
*  Our thoughts and prayers obviously go out to Kate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  and her entire family, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=166.2s)]
*  along with the people of Great Britain. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=167.6s)]
*  Joining us now with more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=169.28s)]
*  is the US Associate Editor of the Daily Mail, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=170.72s)]
*  Charlie Langston is with us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=173.52s)]
*  Charlie, thank you for joining us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  Pretty shocking news. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=176.6s)]
*  We knew she had had the operation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=177.8s)]
*  We know that King Charles, he's had a cancer diagnosis. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=180.28s)]
*  This seemingly came out of nowhere. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=184.24s)]
*  Not a lot of details, but chemotherapy, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=186.88s)]
*  out of an abundance of caution, that's always rough. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=189.68s)]
*  Absolutely, and as you said, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=193.88s)]
*  she is a 42-year-old mother of three, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  and I think that this news came as much of a shock to her [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=198.48s)]
*  as it has now to the entire world. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  When she went in for this operation in January, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=205.6s)]
*  she was under the assumption that it was non-cancerous, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  that that was not going to be something [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=210.96s)]
*  she was going to have to deal with. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=212.64s)]
*  So to get that news must have been truly devastating. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=215.0s)]
*  We do now know that she received that news [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=218.48s)]
*  around the same time that William pulled out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=220.76s)]
*  of a memorial service back in February. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=223.64s)]
*  So it's clear that it really did ricochet [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=226.44s)]
*  through the family, and it's obviously been incredibly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=228.76s)]
*  difficult for both William and Kate to get their heads around [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=231.4s)]
*  how to share this news with their three young children. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=235.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we're in a situation now where Prince William [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=239.28s)]
*  has to deal with his wife with cancer, his dad with cancer, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=243.4s)]
*  three young kids, and managing what emotions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=247.2s)]
*  they may be having at the time, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=250.68s)]
*  on top of a situation that has not been good [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=252.52s)]
*  with his brother and sister-in-law. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=255.44s)]
*  Absolutely, and Prince Harry and Meghan did issue [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=257.68s)]
*  a very brief statement today, simply saying that they wish [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=260.8s)]
*  Kate health and happiness, and they hope that she's able [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=264.36s)]
*  to achieve that in privacy and in peace. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=268.28s)]
*  But I think that behind the scenes, the story really here, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=271.16s)]
*  is that William is going through this by himself. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=274.56s)]
*  He is shouldering an enormous amount of responsibility [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=277.76s)]
*  as far as the royal family is concerned, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=281.0s)]
*  with his father out of action, his wife out of action. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=283.32s)]
*  William has had to step up and take on a huge amount [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=286.4s)]
*  of duties here, and in addition to that, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=289.55999999999995s)]
*  he's trying to support two of the people who are closest [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=291.96s)]
*  to him through their cancer treatments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=295.08s)]
*  And to do that without Harry for support [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  is just devastating, particularly when Harry and William [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=301.08s)]
*  were one another's pillars when their mother Diana passed away, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=304.84s)]
*  and for William to now be going through [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  another personal crisis but without his sibling [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=310.68s)]
*  is just heartbreaking, and I truly think that Diana [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=314.44s)]
*  would be devastated if she were here [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=317.44s)]
*  to see what's going on today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=319.56s)]
*  I think you're probably right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=322.08s)]
*  Charlie, thank you, we appreciate that report. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiIn5gi8kuE&t=323.71999999999997s)]
