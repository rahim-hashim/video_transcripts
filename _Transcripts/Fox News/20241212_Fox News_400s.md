# Trump’s second term will be ‘transformative,’ Stephen Miller predicts
**Fox News:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0)
*  Earlier today, President Biden announced that he had commuted the sentences of a record [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=0.0s)]
*  1,500 federal prisoners who were released to home confinement during COVID. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=5.34s)]
*  Oh, I wonder if that would have happened had Kamala Harris won. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=10.06s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=14.98s)]
*  And of course, Joe Biden has turned his presidential pardon power into a new favorite hobby. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=16.32s)]
*  He already issued one of the most sweeping pardons ever, that to his son Hunter. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=21.42s)]
*  I have a funny feeling a few more Bidens might be pardoned by the time all things are said and done. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=25.98s)]
*  Biden still has plenty of time to issue more pardons. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=31.78s)]
*  Everyone from maybe Liz Cheney to Hillary Clinton to Anthony Fauci, they are reportedly being [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  considered for preemptive pardons. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=40.18s)]
*  Here is what Corrine Jean-Pierre had to say about this earlier today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=42.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=46.18s)]
*  In the news, we've seen Liz Cheney, Dr. Fauci. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=47.18s)]
*  These are the preemptive pardons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  I know you don't want to get ahead of the president's thinking, but are any of those names wrong? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=53.02s)]
*  Or still, I mean, do you want to tell us anything about? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=56.18000000000001s)]
*  It would be a bad move on my behalf if I preempted the president or previewed anything that the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=59.82s)]
*  president was thinking about, considering. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  And so this is something that he's going to talk with his team about. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=70.06s)]
*  And I just don't have anything beyond that for you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=75.66s)]
*  Here with reaction is the next White House chief of staff for policy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=79.34s)]
*  Our friend Stephen Miller is back. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=83.14s)]
*  I'm sure you're looking forward, what, 39 or so days away, getting back into your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=84.58s)]
*  old office in the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  Somebody has been basically taking over your office in the meantime. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=98.7s)]
*  Well, glad to have you back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=99.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=102.54s)]
*  Let's get your reaction. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=103.54s)]
*  Donald Trump said he doesn't want revenge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=104.66000000000001s)]
*  That success will be our revenge reaction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=107.54s)]
*  Yes, the president's been very clear about this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=111.14s)]
*  What are his priorities? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  When he comes into office on January 20th, 39 days like all Americans, Sean, I can't [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  wait. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=122.54s)]
*  He's going to drill, baby drill, bring down the cost of energy and seal the border. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  He's going to make America safe again, fight violent crime, put dangerous criminals behind [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  bars, get criminal gangs out of this country, get illegal alien predators out of this country, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=132.94s)]
*  restore peace in Europe, restore peace in the Middle East. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=139.74s)]
*  And then he's going to work with Congress to pass historic tax cuts and get this economy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=142.82s)]
*  booming again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=146.62s)]
*  And of course, deregulation to get government out of the way so we can have wage growth, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=147.62s)]
*  job growth, salary growth and balanced opportunity in this country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=152.14s)]
*  He's also been clear that Cash Patel is going to fundamentally reform the FBI. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=155.94s)]
*  He's going to pursue accountability with the deep state and is going to make sure that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=160.5s)]
*  we end the partisan weaponization of our justice system. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=164.14s)]
*  These are goals, Sean, that all Americans support. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=167.34s)]
*  Now on the other hand, retribution is one thing, but people that did commit crimes or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=170.94s)]
*  abuse power, what do you do in that case? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=175.7s)]
*  He is going to make sure that Pam Bondi and Cash Patel have a free hand to follow the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=180.34s)]
*  wherever they lead in ensuring accountability. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=187.14s)]
*  If a government worker, if a federal employee has engaged in gross breaches of trust or [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=191.42s)]
*  law or criminality, of course there should be consequences for that behavior, but that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=198.33999999999997s)]
*  has to be based on the rule of law. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=205.7s)]
*  And President Trump has made clear there will be accountability, there will be answers, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=208.5s)]
*  there will be transparency. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=213.7s)]
*  This will be uncovered and revealed to the whole American people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=215.78s)]
*  And he has absolute confidence in Pam, absolute confidence in Cash, by the way, knowing them [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=219.94s)]
*  both. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=225.58s)]
*  They're incredible people, true amazing patriots, to make sure that this process, these investigations [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=226.58s)]
*  into the deep state are carried out with the utmost integrity and again to use that word [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=233.98s)]
*  accountability, Sean. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=238.94s)]
*  And again, that's what all Americans want. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=239.94s)]
*  They want a government that's accountable to the people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=242.14s)]
*  I talk about returning to constitutional order and we think about our framers and our founders [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=246.1s)]
*  and what did they want? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=251.66s)]
*  What did they describe? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=253.5s)]
*  Government buy of and for the people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=255.61999999999998s)]
*  Okay, those are words. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  But they also talked a lot about limited government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=258.74s)]
*  And we're talking about cutting $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse in government, which [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=261.78s)]
*  I think is great. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=266.7s)]
*  We're talking about increasing revenues, becoming the most energy-rich country on earth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=268.98s)]
*  We're talking about bringing our economy back, getting our supply chain back in order. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  That will help Americans at the grocery store. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=277.26s)]
*  Then, of course, eliminating, closing our borders and eliminating those people that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=279.26s)]
*  entered our country illegally, especially criminal aliens. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=285.1s)]
*  That'll be a priority. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=287.94s)]
*  Restoring law and order, restoring America's place in the world. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=288.94s)]
*  If the president just accomplished that, how transformative would that be? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=292.74s)]
*  It would be indescribable, Sean. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  So just to go through that list again. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=302.1s)]
*  So you're talking about first, government efficiency. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=303.98s)]
*  And not only are we talking about reducing the federal deficit by making government more [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=306.88s)]
*  streamlined and more focused on its core duties, but you're also talking about reducing the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=311.86s)]
*  power of an unelected bureaucracy over the lives of our people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=317.18s)]
*  This is about restoring democracy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=321.42s)]
*  Then you talk about the fundamental safety issues. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=323.54s)]
*  Sean, we have transnational gangs operating in all 50 American states. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  We have cartels, ruthless, bloodthirsty cartels. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  In every single American state, you have gangs like Trinidad and Ragua, like MS-13. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=335.42s)]
*  You have the Sinaloa cartel. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=340.26s)]
*  And you have hundreds of thousands of Americans being killed by fentanyl that's coming across [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=342.38s)]
*  the southern border. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=346.68s)]
*  President Trump is going to stop the massacre, the massacre of our citizens at the hands [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=348.42s)]
*  of these drug cartels. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=354.42s)]
*  And then on top of all of that, Sean, we have wars and violence raging all over the world [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=356.66s)]
*  that threatens to destabilize the entire planet. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  And President Trump, through strength, through diplomacy, through vision, is going to bring [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  these wars to an end and make America peaceful and make the world peaceful again. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=370.16s)]
*  That is not just transformative, that is historic and unprecedented and is what's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=375.86s)]
*  going to happen starting January 20th. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  All right, we'll see you in Washington. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=383.54s)]
*  We'll be there on the 20th. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=385.7s)]
*  Stephen Miller, thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsdLZJmAm0&t=387.5s)]
