# Gold Star dad arrested during Biden State of the Union speaks out
**Fox News:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0)
*  Now, last Thursday, during the State of the Union address, the father of one of the Marines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=0.0s)]
*  killed in the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan at Karzai Airport during Biden's chaotic withdrawal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=6.74s)]
*  had some choice words for Joe Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=13.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  Year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=16.86s)]
*  Thirty percent they went up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=21.14s)]
*  The biggest increase in history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=26.1s)]
*  It was then, through my American Rescue Plan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=29.32s)]
*  Incredibly, this Gold Star father, Steve Nekue, was actually arrested afterwards and charged [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=35.12s)]
*  by police with the disturbance of public peace. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=41.88s)]
*  By the way, it carries up to 90 days in jail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=46.64s)]
*  Steve joins us now for an exclusive interview along with California Congressman Darrell [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=49.0s)]
*  Issa. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=53.24s)]
*  First, sir, you're almost 20 years old. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=54.24s)]
*  I'm so sorry at your loss. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And frankly, to me, it's understandable how you feel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=59.28s)]
*  And it doesn't—I still believe in free speech. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=62.92s)]
*  You are one man, a grieving father, that should not be arrested for one minor little moment [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=67.68s)]
*  at a State of the Union address. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=75.4s)]
*  I find that offensive. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=77.04s)]
*  I think Joe Biden by now should have spoken out and said, Leave this Gold Star father [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  alone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't expect it from him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  He probably won't—doesn't even know his name or the name of the other 12 people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  killed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=88.12s)]
*  But what's the status of where you are? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=90.12s)]
*  And I'm sorry about your loss. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=91.72s)]
*  With all my heart, I mean that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=93.36s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Sean. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=95.36s)]
*  And I want to thank the man next to me, Congressman Issa. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=99.08s)]
*  He's part of a group that has helped us, the other Gold Star parents, since June, when, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=104.6s)]
*  you know, we didn't know if we had any chance. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=111.36s)]
*  He's part of a four—Congressmen that we affectionately call the Four Horsemen, which [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=117.72s)]
*  is Issa, Waltz, Mast, and Mills, all led by Chairman McCall, who helped to try to get [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  us answers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=130.68s)]
*  And we wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  So I want to thank Darrell for, you know, helping us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=135.44s)]
*  And also, I want to bring light to the fact that on the 19th, General McKenzie and General [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=139.8s)]
*  Miley, who we believe, you know, are the main causes of the evacuations debacle, they're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=146.0s)]
*  going to be at Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  And you know, these are the ones that said that there was nothing that they could have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=154.8s)]
*  done and they didn't see anything wrong with the way that this evacuation was handled. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=158.0s)]
*  And you know, I need all Americans to be, you know, watching that, be a part of that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=163.68s)]
*  and you know, Democrats and Republicans, to finally speak out against it so we can get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=169.4s)]
*  some closure to this terrible thing that's happened. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=174.32s)]
*  Now, you lost your son, and then you had another son who committed suicide a year later near [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=180.24s)]
*  Kareem's grave. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=188.76s)]
*  I read this and my jaw dropped to the floor because I don't know how parents. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=191.2s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate you bringing that up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=201.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=202.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=204.96s)]
*  I want to be clear and I want to say his name. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=206.2s)]
*  So yeah, I was not his dad. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=208.84s)]
*  He's been in my life since he was two years old. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=211.4s)]
*  His name was Dakota James Halverson. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=213.52s)]
*  And you know, his brother loved him very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=217.0s)]
*  He was very close to him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=221.4s)]
*  And you know, he was devastated by Kareem's missing or, you know, Kareem losing his life [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=223.28s)]
*  and ultimately affected him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=231.64s)]
*  And he took his life at a park that we were planning to name after Kareem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=233.84s)]
*  So it's, you know, been devastating for his mother. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  It's been devastating for his siblings, for his brother, for his sisters. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=246.56s)]
*  And the effect of this president, just like Stephen Miller said, you know, this is a reactionary [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=252.28s)]
*  president and the poor Riley family, you know, they're killing my kid, they're killing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  their kid. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=260.72s)]
*  And what are you going to do America? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=261.72s)]
*  You're going to wait till they kill your kid? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=262.72s)]
*  Because you know, he's a bumper car hitting everything on his way out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  And the only one that's going to be left to pick up the pieces is us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=271.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, Sean, you're- [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Congressman Issa, I want- [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  You've already said, you've already said the name more often than the president. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Steve's already said his son's name more often than the president. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, one of the reasons that there's no closure is there's never been a real acknowledgement [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=289.28s)]
*  by this president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=293.44s)]
*  And the five gold star family members who were in attendance that night, Steve being [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=295.28s)]
*  one of the stalwart leaders, they were there because they're asking for closure. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=299.4s)]
*  And what you're hearing Steve as a grieving father say is he can't bring his son back. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=304.52s)]
*  He can't bring his other son back. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=309.7s)]
*  What he can do is make sure some other family doesn't suffer this way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=311.36s)]
*  And that's all he's asking the president to do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=315.92s)]
*  And that's what the president isn't willing to do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=317.88s)]
*  He'll talk about Bo's death, but he won't talk about these 13 or how we keep it from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=320.52s)]
*  happening again and again. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=325.6s)]
*  I think that's such a good point. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=329.0s)]
*  Mr. Nakui, I don't even have words for people like yourself and families like yours. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=332.84s)]
*  And I hope, Congressman Issa, I hope that you and your fellow congressmen can get together [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=340.68s)]
*  and somebody get the police off this guy's back. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=349.04s)]
*  Can we at least do that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=353.7s)]
*  Can we at least, you know, let this guy have free speech rights after all he's been through? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=355.52s)]
*  Do we really need to pile on with a legal system? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=360.8s)]
*  Do you think we're going to be able to help him that way at least? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=363.76s)]
*  Sean, we've already contacted and we're following up with a letter to show the history [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=367.2s)]
*  of other people with far less reason to have an outburst who have not been charged. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=372.12s)]
*  And that's under Presidents as recent as President Trump. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=378.44s)]
*  So we think it's only just that there be equal treatment, if not less. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=381.48s)]
*  You know, I've known Steve now since that tragic day and the first time we met and we've [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=387.72s)]
*  been together many times. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=392.16s)]
*  He is someone who is grieving. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=393.94s)]
*  He prays every day for the other men and women of the armed forces, especially the Marines. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=395.68s)]
*  And that is the reason he was willing to come on his own cost to the State of the Union. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=401.76s)]
*  And it's the reason he's here tonight is that it is so important that these young Marines [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=407.24s)]
*  and soldiers not have died in vain. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=413.4s)]
*  Mr. Nakui, I can tell you this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=417.08s)]
*  And Sean, if I was able to just… [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=418.64s)]
*  We have a really special audience that watches this show. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=419.64s)]
*  Yeah, sir? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=422.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, go on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=425.64s)]
*  No, just that I know everyone hearing you understands, can understand the pain you're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=427.64s)]
*  going through. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=434.24s)]
*  You wanted to say, sir? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=435.24s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to say I wanted to be clear what I had said because the only time [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=436.24s)]
*  I ever watched it was right now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't watch anything that I've ever been on and I don't have a social media [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=443.76s)]
*  that I look at. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=448.28s)]
*  But I wanted to be clear because I think there's some misunderstanding what I said. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=449.28s)]
*  You know, I said, Do you remember Abby Gate? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  And when I did that, I was praying and, you know, because I was looking at this spectacle [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  that I was seeing below me and I was listening to him and I was praying, you know, hoping [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=461.92s)]
*  that maybe at some point prior to this that he had mentioned, you know, Afghanistan or [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=465.62s)]
*  our kids because all the Gold Star parents were thinking that that might be a possibility [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=470.44s)]
*  and it wasn't happening. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  And then as soon as he said something about kids and then something about being safe, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=476.44s)]
*  I don't even know what I did. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=484.8s)]
*  I didn't even do that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=485.8s)]
*  I just jumped up and I said, Do you remember Abby Gate? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=486.8s)]
*  It was like the Lord convicted me. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=489.6s)]
*  The Holy Spirit got in me. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=491.04s)]
*  And when I did it, I paused. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=492.64s)]
*  I was like, Oh, what did I do? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=494.76s)]
*  You know, and then right after that, I said, you know, United States Marines or United [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=496.24s)]
*  States Marines, Kareem M. Nkoui, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, because I've been waiting for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=501.36s)]
*  three years for this man to say my son's name into this chamber and he never did. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=506.28s)]
*  But on this day, on this day, his name was said. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I know. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=515.4s)]
*  Please know our prayers are with you and your family and all the other families as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=518.4s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=523.24s)]
*  And I mean that with all my heart. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=524.24s)]
*  Congressman, I said thank you for what you're doing as well. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxa_R-mg9g0&t=525.8s)]
