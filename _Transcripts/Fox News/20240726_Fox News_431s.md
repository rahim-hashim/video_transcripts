# Can Kamala Harris talk her way through this disaster?:  'Hannity' panelists answer
**Fox News:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ)
*  And welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  With Kamala Harris now at the top of the ticket, the Biden and Harris—the Biden-Harris administration's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  failed economic record, because it's both of them, continues to loom large, despite [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  her desire to be unburdened by what has been. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=13.72s)]
*  But here are the facts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  On Kamala's watch, the price of a starter home in over 200 cities across the country [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=18.84s)]
*  has risen past a million dollars. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  On Kamala's watch, American automakers' electric vehicles divisions are losing billions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  On Kamala's watch, inflation is up 20 percent, and wages have not kept up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=33.76s)]
*  Interest rates are so high, people can't afford to buy homes or cars or really anything, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=39.44s)]
*  especially with credit cards now charging 30 percent interest rates. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=44.72s)]
*  I have one that went up to 35 percent, by the way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  And here's the best part. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=52.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris has been one of the biggest boosters of Bidenomics, and according to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=54.2s)]
*  her, it was all part of the plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=58.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=61.0s)]
*  All of this is part of our blueprint together for what America can be. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=62.0s)]
*  This is Bidenomics, a plan to invest in America and build a future in which all people can [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  truly thrive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=81.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=82.28s)]
*  We're here now with Reaction, our Kayleigh McGee White from The Washington Examiner, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=83.36s)]
*  Committee to Unleash Prosperity, founder Steve Moore, whose newsletter I get every day, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  it's great, and Democratic pollster Doug Schoen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=92.16s)]
*  Doug, let me just start with you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  This is Americans are suffering. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=98.08s)]
*  We all know it doesn't care the price of eggs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=100.6s)]
*  Don't ask you what your party is before you go and can't buy them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=103.48s)]
*  You know, this is very serious. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=106.6s)]
*  You can't memory hole it on the internet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=109.36s)]
*  Is she going to be able to talk her way through the economic disaster we're still experiencing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=112.28s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden couldn't talk his way through. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=119.88s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why his poll numbers tank. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't really see what Kamala Harris can say to deal with inflation and the cost of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=128.08s)]
*  living skyrocketing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=136.0s)]
*  She's got to try to personalize her concerns, but so far she's come up empty, and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=138.28s)]
*  Democrats have come up empty. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=144.68s)]
*  I'm a Democrat. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=146.4s)]
*  I want the party to address these issues, but so far an honest assessment is they failed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=147.88s)]
*  You know, Kayleigh, I think one thing they seem to be doing is painting her as an empty [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=154.68s)]
*  vessel who was delivered by the planet Venus, who has nothing to do with anything that happened, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=159.96s)]
*  and that she is now going to be the savior because she's an innocent bystander. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=166.04s)]
*  Is that really the only way she can proceed? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=171.56s)]
*  Right, but it's not true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=174.2s)]
*  She didn't just have an inactive role in the Biden administration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=176.76s)]
*  She was helping implement it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  So this is one of the things that a teleprompter is not going to be able to help Kamala Harris [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=182.68s)]
*  with. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=187.6s)]
*  And I think that of my own generation here, Gen Z, younger voters, you know, younger voters [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=188.6s)]
*  were moving away from Joe Biden well before his debate against Donald Trump when his campaign [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=193.08s)]
*  imploded. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=198.16s)]
*  And that was not necessarily even because of his mental capacity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=199.16s)]
*  It was because of the policies. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=202.08s)]
*  It was because of our economic concerns. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=203.84s)]
*  It's very difficult for any of us to afford to buy our first homes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=206.24s)]
*  It's very difficult for many to even afford their groceries on a weekly basis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=209.44s)]
*  Those core concerns have not changed, even if the Democratic candidate has. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=213.82s)]
*  So Kamala needs to speak directly to those concerns. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=218.38s)]
*  And I don't see how she's going to be able to do that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=221.06s)]
*  You know, let me ask Steve. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=223.86s)]
*  All of this is very good points. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=225.78s)]
*  But the fact is, she touts policies that are Marxist, that even if she was going to pretend [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=227.58s)]
*  she was going to solve our problems, the policies that she touts do the opposite. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=235.9s)]
*  Is that how you see it? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=242.24s)]
*  Yeah, look, I don't really get why Kamala Harris has basically embraced binomics. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=243.74s)]
*  I mean, the Democrats, Doug made this point, that Democrats have a chance for a reset now [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=250.1s)]
*  and then to sort of say, OK, look, Biden was a complete failure when it came to the economy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=255.1s)]
*  I'm going to give you something new. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=259.5s)]
*  That's not what she's saying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=261.3s)]
*  She has embraced virtually every aspect of Biden's policies, which have been a complete [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=262.46s)]
*  disaster. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=267.74s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned the inflation, obviously. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=268.74s)]
*  The average family has lost $2,100 in real income in the last three and a half years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=270.46s)]
*  And don't forget what Biden and Kamala Harris have done to the debt. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=275.18s)]
*  And one thing that Tulsi Gabbard said, and I love Tulsi, and she was half right when [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=279.42s)]
*  she said, well, it looks like that Kamala Harris is going to be more of the same. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=283.5s)]
*  Actually, I think it's going to be worse than the same, because if you look at her [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  positions, I mean, she's for getting rid of private health insurance and basically [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=292.54s)]
*  having the government take over the health care system. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  She's for requiring every worker in America to join a union, whether they want to or not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=299.62s)]
*  She's for an even more radical, green agenda than Biden is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=306.06s)]
*  So it's not just more of the same. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=310.14s)]
*  I think it'd be much more devastating to the economy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=312.14s)]
*  You know, Doug, I'd mention that they're saying, yeah, it's going to be more of the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  same. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  I see her as new coke, that it's not the same product at all. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  It's that it's presented as something better and new. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=324.7s)]
*  And then obviously that was the biggest flop in American product history, that it's worse. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=328.46s)]
*  It is going to be worse. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=334.5s)]
*  But isn't this perhaps what made Obama hesitant at endorsing that if you are going to blow [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=335.74s)]
*  up the presidency and do something this weird and destructive, to choose someone who genuinely [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=341.78s)]
*  can't be blamed and genuinely has a new point of view if you really want to save democracy? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=347.06s)]
*  Is that—could it be possible that people realize this was a mistake and get—and why [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=354.78s)]
*  not do it again and switch her out and have a real convention? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=361.18s)]
*  Well, I was for an open convention, a mini primary process. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  I agree with you, Tammy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=371.26s)]
*  I think secretly the Obamas were sympathetic to that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=372.94s)]
*  They sort of suggested that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=377.3s)]
*  They only went and endorsed her in this awkward phone conversation when it was inevitable [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=379.9s)]
*  that she will be the consensus choice. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=387.18s)]
*  But candidly, she has a tough record to defend on the southern border, on prosecuting crime [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=390.82s)]
*  in California, and as we were saying on the economy, I think she's in a honeymoon phase [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=398.14s)]
*  now, Tammy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=404.06s)]
*  And, you know, I've done a lot of polls for a lot of people. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=405.06s)]
*  I think she's more likely to go down in the near future than go up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=408.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be—all of this is fascinating, surprises all the time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=413.14s)]
*  Thank you all for joining me. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZXRYBckfQ&t=417.82s)]
