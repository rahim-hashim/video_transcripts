# Hannity: The presidency is a personal vanity project for Harris
**Fox News:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM)
*  But now we are only 95 days until Election Day, 46 days until early voting begins, a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=0.0s)]
*  shocking new development from Kamala Harris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=6.8s)]
*  Now, for the very first time since her coronation, the Democratic hopeful spoke off script. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=9.52s)]
*  It was just one sentence about the hostage release, but even that didn't go particularly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=16.48s)]
*  well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=21.52s)]
*  It was another one of those word salads that didn't quite make any sense. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=22.52s)]
*  Joe Biden was looking on, as per usual, totally dazed and confused. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=26.18s)]
*  And for the first time in a while, I really can't blame him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=30.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=34.3s)]
*  This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  the power of diplomacy and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=42.1s)]
*  of diplomacy and strengthening alliances. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=50.82s)]
*  This is an incredible day. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=54.1s)]
*  At least Joe has an excuse. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=56.1s)]
*  What in the world was she trying to say? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=59.06s)]
*  This is not rocket science. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=61.02s)]
*  She was there to congratulate the American hostages on a safe return home. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=62.22s)]
*  Clearly, this is why Kamala rarely ever speaks off script or takes questions without a teleprompter, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=66.66s)]
*  but it's not the only reason. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=73.18s)]
*  As Kamala likes to say, she just didn't fall out of a coconut tree. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=75.2s)]
*  He has a long and public track record of very radical, extreme and frankly dangerous positions [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=80.06s)]
*  on just about everything from immigration, law and order, the economy, energy independence, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  Now, these are bread and butter issues that impact every one of you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  But now Kamala, with the help of the state-run media mob, is trying to obscure this record. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=96.78s)]
*  He's now hiding behind her own staffers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=102.02s)]
*  And just like Joe is hiding in his basement in 2020 and the media is helping her instead [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=104.5s)]
*  of him, now the campaign spoke to numerous outlets to inform them that Kamala Harris [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=109.68s)]
*  has experienced in the last week a miraculous election year conversion and doesn't actually [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=114.92s)]
*  support many of her one strongly, very strong beliefs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=121.76s)]
*  The conversation on major issues only occurred after she became the presumptive nominee, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  now nominee. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=131.96s)]
*  Unfortunately for Kamala, well, her positions are well documented in her own words, and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=132.96s)]
*  they're afraid of her own words. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=138.6s)]
*  Every day we unearth new videos of your vice president, your Democratic presidential candidates [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  viewing extreme, dangerous and pretty radical record. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=146.46s)]
*  And I'll tell you right now, your rhetoric is insane. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=151.2s)]
*  Now there are various videos. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=154.64s)]
*  The media, frankly, they don't want you to see. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=156.0s)]
*  They're never going to play them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=159.0s)]
*  They'll not ask her. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  They're okay with not interviewing her. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=162.0s)]
*  They're okay with no press conferences. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=164.32s)]
*  But we're going to play them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=166.62s)]
*  Every single night we have the Kamala files, as we call them on Hannity.com. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=168.16s)]
*  You can download them yourself, give them to your friends and family and coworkers and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  strangers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=176.04s)]
*  Anyway, for example, here's Kamala Harris berating Americans for saying Merry Christmas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=177.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=183.08s)]
*  Because illegal immigrants, they're not having a Merry Christmas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=184.08s)]
*  So don't you dare say Merry Christmas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  And only when they cleared that vet did we give them DACA status. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=189.84s)]
*  And now we're talking about taking it away. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=195.4s)]
*  It is morally wrong. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=199.36s)]
*  And when we all sing happy tunes and sing Merry Christmas and wish each other Merry [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=202.32s)]
*  Christmas, these children are not going to have a Merry Christmas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  How dare we speak Merry Christmas? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  How dare we? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  They will not have a Merry Christmas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=218.76s)]
*  They don't know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=221.68s)]
*  Radical, extreme, bizarre, weird even. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  Don't you dare say Merry Christmas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=233.84s)]
*  Short time later, Kamala would be appointed as border czar. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=235.72s)]
*  And can you believe it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=239.4s)]
*  Our border, along with the entire immigration system, is now nothing but an unmitigated [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=240.4s)]
*  disaster and a huge national security threat, a clear and present danger to every American. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=245.4s)]
*  But that didn't stop her campaign from releasing a somewhat laughable ad touting her record [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=252.64s)]
*  on the border, except they don't tell the truth. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=257.18s)]
*  Here's my message to the Harris campaign. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=259.9s)]
*  Pay attention. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=261.78s)]
*  Politicians lie. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=262.78s)]
*  Numbers don't lie. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=264.52s)]
*  And here are the numbers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=265.76s)]
*  Since becoming the border czar, and she's the border czar, Kamala allowed more unvetted [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=266.8s)]
*  illegal immigrants into our country than ever before in the history of the United States. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=273.34s)]
*  In fact, under Harris, there has been more illegal immigration than anywhere in the history [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=277.94s)]
*  of the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=283.02s)]
*  You know, almost 11 million unvetted illegals from 180 countries, with many with terror [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=284.02s)]
*  ties, many countries that are enemies of our country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=291.18s)]
*  And she wants a promotion? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=295.34s)]
*  She has blood on her hands. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=297.3s)]
*  Many Americans raped, murdered by Joe and Kamala's unvetted illegal immigrants under [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=299.86s)]
*  their watch. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  Tens of thousands dead from fentanyl pouring across our border. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=307.82s)]
*  Mexican cartels emboldened like never before. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=312.18s)]
*  Make no mistake, what is happening at the border is not some big random coincidence [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=315.54s)]
*  out of Kamala's control. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=320.98s)]
*  They bragged about undoing the Trump policies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=322.36s)]
*  For years, she has vilified ICE and border security officials. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=325.26s)]
*  She promised mass amnesty to illegal immigrants. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=329.8s)]
*  She called for illegal immigration to be decriminalized and then proposed giving free [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=333.56s)]
*  health care to illegal immigrants, free education to illegal immigrants. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=339.24s)]
*  She helped California become a sanctuary state. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=344.18s)]
*  She bragged all about it on tape. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=347.06s)]
*  As a matter of fact, now a message from the Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=349.12s)]
*  on borders and immigration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=355.12s)]
*  This whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=357.0s)]
*  We've been to the border. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=360.12s)]
*  You haven't been to the border. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=361.12s)]
*  And I haven't been to Europe. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=363.36s)]
*  And I don't understand the point that you're making. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=365.24s)]
*  You support giving universal health care, Medicare for all to people who are in this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=368.76s)]
*  country illegally? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=376.56s)]
*  to public safety, public education or public health, period. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=383.76s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=389.12s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=391.68s)]
*  Congress to do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  The first request we made, pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=407.2s)]
*  We have to have a secure border. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  But I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=410.64s)]
*  across the border as criminals. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=414.68s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=415.96s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=416.96s)]
*  There are videos that the state-run media mob ought to be playing and asking her questions [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=417.96s)]
*  about. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  But again, they're not going to do it because they know Kamala will get crushed if she is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  forced to confront her own words, her own statements, her own agenda. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  Now keep in mind, it is not just the border. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=432.0s)]
*  Now a message from Kamala Harris about America's green new socialist economy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=439.88s)]
*  So again, back to the United States Congress. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=440.88s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=443.32s)]
*  If they fail to act as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=444.84s)]
*  to pass a green new deal. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  She'll even get rid of the filibuster for the green new deal that she co-sponsored in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=453.44s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=456.67999999999995s)]
*  And now a message from Kamala about all the new taxes she wants to impose on you and your [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  family. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=464.67999999999995s)]
*  So these are some of the ways, but we've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1%. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=470.32s)]
*  And that part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=474.16s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up for the richest Americans. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Even said that, well, if they go up to 70 or 80 percent, she applauded AOC's commitment [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=483.68s)]
*  towards that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=490.3s)]
*  Said it was fantastic. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=491.3s)]
*  Over the last four years, these words have been backed up by her actions. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  Taxes and spending have sharply increased under the Biden-Harris regime. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=497.8s)]
*  And now your economy is a nightmare. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=503.0s)]
*  Inflation is through the roof and going higher. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=504.76s)]
*  Many are worried about a looming recession. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  And today, stocks plummeted yet again after a terrible jobs report on top of bad economic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=510.0s)]
*  news yesterday. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=516.32s)]
*  Now the unemployment rate is officially again on the rise. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  Kamala owns that record, just like she owns the high cost or the cost of democracy, as [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=520.72s)]
*  she calls it, the high cost of energy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=527.6s)]
*  After calling for a ban on fracking and offshore drilling and oil exploration on public lands, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=530.44s)]
*  another message from Kamala Harris, this time on energy policy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=535.8800000000001s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=540.2s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=545.96s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=550.44s)]
*  Sorry, yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=552.84s)]
*  She owns skyrocketing energy costs, just like she owns the Afghanistan debacle that she [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=555.16s)]
*  admittedly played a big role in planning and the increased terror threat right here at home. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=560.8s)]
*  And now another message from Kamala Harris on radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=566.56s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=571.04s)]
*  You must have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=572.04s)]
*  which is more than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=581.84s)]
*  And we've got to have the courage to reject the term illegal alien. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=590.12s)]
*  She also, you know, owns the breakdown of law and order across the country after supporting [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  the violent riots in the summer of 2020, promoting that bail fund after they burned down the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=599.36s)]
*  Minneapolis police precinct four days earlier, calling for police departments to lose funding [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=605.52s)]
*  and once again, a message from Kamala on law and order. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=611.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=616.0s)]
*  This is a movement, I'm telling you, they're not going to stop and everyone beware because [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=617.0s)]
*  they're not going to stop. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not going to stop before election day in November and they're not going to stop [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=624.7600000000001s)]
*  after election day. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=627.8800000000001s)]
*  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, they're [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=629.6400000000001s)]
*  not going to let up and they should not. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=634.0s)]
*  And she prays defunding the police and reimagining the police. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=637.2600000000001s)]
*  Kamala's radical positions aren't the only concern. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=641.48s)]
*  According to her own staff, apparently she's a terrible leader and a mean one. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=644.48s)]
*  According to one report, quote, bully Kamala Harris berated staff, left them in tears after [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=649.48s)]
*  berating them with F bombs. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=655.24s)]
*  One intern told, was told to never make eye contact with her. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=657.26s)]
*  These claims are backed up by the numbers. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=661.24s)]
*  As vice president, the staff turnaround and turnover rate was over 90%. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=663.52s)]
*  But none of this matters to Kamala Harris. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=668.9200000000001s)]
*  Like Joe Biden, the presidency is a personal vanity project for Harris. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  She's going to say and do whatever she needs to say or do to get elected and get power. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=675.72s)]
*  For her, this isn't about making the country a better place. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=680.0s)]
*  This is about her own political personal ambition. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=683.12s)]
*  This kind of toxic thinking is clearly carried over to some of her biggest backers, including [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=686.44s)]
*  those activists who met with Vice President Harris dozens of times. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=691.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=696.3000000000001s)]
*  We have to get out there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=698.0s)]
*  They got their people. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=699.0s)]
*  They got all the trailer parts all covered. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=700.0s)]
*  All of the people up in the, in West Virginia in the hills, they covered. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=703.04s)]
*  They got them all the way there to Wall Street. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=708.2s)]
*  He did that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=711.24s)]
*  And we said to them, tell them about the white women, excuse me, forget the white women. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=712.24s)]
*  They're going to do what they, what they white men tell them to do. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=717.68s)]
*  So does Kamala support that kind of rhetoric? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=722.76s)]
*  Will anyone in the state run media mob ask her about these comments? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=725.1600000000001s)]
*  Will she ever sit for an interview, ever do a press conference? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=728.6s)]
*  Will they ask her if she supports the anti-Semitic rhetoric coming from the base of her own party? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=731.76s)]
*  At this point, the Democratic Party has become so extreme that it's risky, according to all [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=738.12s)]
*  these reports out all week, to pick a Jewish running mate. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=743.84s)]
*  In fact, if she does pick Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, it appears that he's the leading [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  candidate, the inner party pushback in order to be an internal civil war, democratic civil [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=751.92s)]
*  war might break out. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=758.68s)]
*  Even now, the left is planting hit pieces all over the place on Shapiro in the press, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=760.36s)]
*  including an alleged sexual harassment coverup inside his own office that they use taxpayer [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=765.68s)]
*  money to pay off. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=771.84s)]
*  Even Michigan's democratic darling, Michael Moore, is warning that if she picks Shapiro, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=773.48s)]
*  may sink the Democratic Party ticket. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=779.0s)]
*  They may even lose the state of Michigan. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, all is not well in the land of the Democratic Party in spite of the glowing treatment [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  from the state run media mob. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=790.5999999999999s)]
*  There will be an ebb and flow to this election, I promise you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  There's already been a shakeup at the Harris campaign, several new advisors, including [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=795.56s)]
*  Obama veteran David Plouffe, as we love to call him. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBTa4rJFyM&t=800.1999999999999s)]
