# The $454 million ruling is ‘ludicrous’: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk)
*  Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=0.0s)]
*  He's now leading in the polls and here with analysis, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  All right, there's a lot to unwrap here legally. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I'll let you choose what you want to begin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=10.44s)]
*  But I would look at this as a big win for Donald Trump today in terms of the half a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=13.46s)]
*  billion dollar plus. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=18.56s)]
*  But I would like an answer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  I would like somebody to be held accountable for the phony valuation that Judge Angorin [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  now holds to this day of Mar-a-Lago being only worth between 18 and what, 20 some-odd [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=27.88s)]
*  million dollars when I've shown empty lots, two acres going for 200 million. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=35.04s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing about the vapors that you were witnessing from various pundits [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=40.84s)]
*  is that this is simply to allow another judge to review what Angorin did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=47.64s)]
*  So what they're complaining about is that Trump didn't have to do a fire sale on his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=53.76s)]
*  property just to be able to get other judges to look at this ruling. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=59.28s)]
*  And the ruling is ludicrous. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=64.6s)]
*  That is, the ruling is based on really speculative numbers by the court. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=66.48s)]
*  You drill down, there's nothing really there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=71.34s)]
*  And then the problem, of course, is that the penalty in this case should have been a dollar [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=73.84s)]
*  because no one lost a dollar. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=78.12s)]
*  The people that were the supposed victims, these companies, these banks, wanted more [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=80.52s)]
*  business from Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=84.96s)]
*  Now, what the judge ordered in New York was supervision, and he could have stopped there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=86.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=91.72s)]
*  If you think that there's undervaluing and overvaluing, then sure, order supervision. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=92.72s)]
*  But that's not what this judge wanted to do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=97.16s)]
*  This judge picked an arbitrary number that made it almost impossible for Trump to secure [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=99.0s)]
*  to protect his businesses unless he was willing to sell off some of his businesses. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=106.52s)]
*  Let me run some poll numbers by you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  John McLaughlin and associates, 67 percent say politics played a role in the indictment [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=114.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=119.32s)]
*  That's over two-thirds, Jonathan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=120.32s)]
*  Fifty-eight percent say Biden played a role in the indictments of Donald Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Only 30 percent say it's not true that Biden is trying to jail Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=127.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=132.6s)]
*  I think the American people, you know, you lay out facts for them in spite of a media [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=133.68s)]
*  that I think is abusively biased. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=139.04s)]
*  They kind of get it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  They do get it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=144.28s)]
*  And I think that they recognize it for what it is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=145.28s)]
*  It's not that they necessarily like Trump, but they don't like what they're seeing, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  particularly in New York. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=152.24s)]
*  They've created this inescapable political vortex that used to be a legal system. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=153.48s)]
*  And it's damaging not just the courts, it's damaging the city. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=159.62s)]
*  Who wants to go to a city where they try to get you to sell off your property just to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  get an appeal to look at what a judge did? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  And so the damage there has been below the waterline. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=172.14s)]
*  It's going to have to be repaired. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  But now the New York Court of Appeals could restore some integrity to their system and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=176.14s)]
*  look at these, at this number. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=181.38s)]
*  There's two issues here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=183.34s)]
*  You know, whether he overvalued and undervalued, that's something very common in the real estate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=184.6s)]
*  area. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=189.22s)]
*  The other major issue is, does this violate the Constitution? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=190.22s)]
*  Almost half a billion dollars in penalty when no one lost a single cent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=194.42s)]
*  Let me ask you about the Bragg case, now scheduled to begin on April the 15th. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=200.46s)]
*  Andy McCarthy had a pretty interesting analysis of this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=206.74s)]
*  I think you share this view. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=210.78s)]
*  He said that Bragg was falsifying his prosecution. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=213.58s)]
*  And he said, knowing that a plain-spoken admission that he was trying to enforce federal law, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  he goes on to say, and a federal statute that the state prosecutor had no authority to enforce [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=224.58s)]
*  that the feds themselves passed on, and their lead witness, well, I wouldn't say he's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  the most credible human being on the face of the earth. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=235.74s)]
*  How does that play out? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, Andy's spot on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=240.74s)]
*  Many of us have been writing from the beginning of this case that is sort of a Frankenstein [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=244.1s)]
*  monster of a case. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=249.54s)]
*  It's composed of different parts of the federal and state code. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  So what he basically did is he took a misdemeanor where the time has already run out from the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=254.54s)]
*  prosecutor and bootstrapped the federal crime so that he could extend the statute of limitations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=259.02s)]
*  But the Department of Justice rejected that crime. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=265.14s)]
*  That's the same type of theory they used against John Edwards. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=268.02s)]
*  It collapsed in a really abysmal failure by the Justice Department. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=270.58s)]
*  And so they declined to do it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=275.02s)]
*  And so you've created this bizarre filing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=276.74s)]
*  I'm surprised that it has not been dismissed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  But Trump may have to face a trial in order to get serious review of the underlying theory. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=284.18s)]
*  But now we're going to have the spectacle of a disbarred lawyer, Michael Cohen, who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  just recently was denounced by a judge who said that he was a serial perjurer, that he [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  was still gaming the system. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=301.34s)]
*  And that's going to be your star witness. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=303.82s)]
*  It's going to be another blow, I think, to the integrity of the New York legal system. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=306.58s)]
*  But we'll see if the New York jury buys this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=312.26s)]
*  I think that what Bragg is betting on is that the jury won't get past the name on the caption [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=315.38s)]
*  of the criminal complaint and that they will spend very little time looking at either [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=320.86s)]
*  the law or the evidence and focus on who's behind the defense table. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=325.06s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Turley, as always, thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qw1ortxRk&t=331.90000000000003s)]
