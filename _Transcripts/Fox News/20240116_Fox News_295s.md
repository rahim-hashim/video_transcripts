# Gingrich on Iowa results: 'Get over it'
**Fox News:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo)
*  Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, you became part of a very big ad that the Trump campaign or somebody put [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=2.0s)]
*  together, I'm not sure if it was the super PAC or the campaign, and you voice it over [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=7.4s)]
*  and you make a comparison about corruption with the Clintons and the Bidens and a dual [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=11.52s)]
*  system of justice. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=16.4s)]
*  I don't know to what degree that played a role tonight, but certainly it did not deter [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=17.52s)]
*  many people in Iowa tonight for voting for Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=24.16s)]
*  What's your analysis? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=26.72s)]
*  Well, as you know, I almost never write anything down. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=27.72s)]
*  Listening to the two brilliant people, you know, you just had two of the best analysts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=34.12s)]
*  on American politics that we have. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=39.76s)]
*  So I've got five quick points. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=42.1s)]
*  One, this is the people's victory. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=43.8s)]
*  Despite every media, despite every lawsuit, despite every effort to destroy Trump, the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=47.2s)]
*  People of Iowa have stood up and said, no, he is our candidate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=53.16s)]
*  Number two, he's the nominee. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=58.04s)]
*  Get over it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  He is the nominee. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=61.48s)]
*  He's going to win the nomination. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=62.48s)]
*  The news media doesn't want to say that because they need to somehow hype. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=64.2s)]
*  Please watch us while we go through this charade. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=68.12s)]
*  There is no candidacy for number two. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=71.36s)]
*  There is no number two. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=73.9s)]
*  There are irrelevancies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=75.8s)]
*  You get to be the leading irrelevant or the second irrelevant or the third irrelevant, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=76.8s)]
*  but nobody's going to be number two because he's going to dominate totally. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=81.14s)]
*  If you look at the country at large, where he's at like 62 or 64 percent approval, Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=84.94s)]
*  is not a candidate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=90.54s)]
*  Trump is the leader of a nationwide movement to take power back from the establishment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=92.54s)]
*  And that's why every time he's attacked by the judiciary, every time he's attacked by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=98.86s)]
*  the news media, he gets stronger because people go, yep, that's what I thought. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=104.82s)]
*  That's exactly what those corrupt people will do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=109.26s)]
*  And of course, starting with the Russian hoax, it's just clear these people lie all the time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=111.42s)]
*  Finally, Iowa has turned red. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=117.9s)]
*  When I first got involved in politics, Iowa was a very competitive state and sometimes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=120.26s)]
*  it was a sort of Democrat state. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=124.98s)]
*  But over the years, Iowa has moved away, and Trump is a big part of this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  If you look at the who's winning elections in Iowa today, they're Republicans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=131.26s)]
*  If you look at which party is collapsing in Iowa today, it's the Democrats. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=134.58s)]
*  That's a harbinger, I think, of what the next few years are going to be like. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=139.22s)]
*  So that's my sweeping introduction. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=142.9s)]
*  By the way, as a side note, I do need to remind people that when I was in Atlanta, Georgia, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=144.74s)]
*  I was the emcee the night you became Speaker of the House, but I would often be the emcee [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=150.06s)]
*  of events that you spoke at. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, you wrote down notes tonight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=156.22s)]
*  Just so people understand how profound that is, every time you were to give a speech, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=157.94s)]
*  about five minutes before your speech, you would call me over and ask if I had a pen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=163.18s)]
*  And you would take a real cloth napkin and a Sharpie or a marker and you would write [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=168.22s)]
*  down three or four things. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=173.14s)]
*  You'd throw it on the podium and that was your 45-minute speech. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=174.82s)]
*  So that is profound that you actually wrote that down tonight, and that's how far back [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=179.32s)]
*  we go together. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=183.14s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I bet you helped make my life a part of history. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=184.14s)]
*  I'm very grateful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=188.34s)]
*  Thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=189.34s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=190.34s)]
*  Glad to be with you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=191.34s)]
*  Well, if I... [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=192.34s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=193.34s)]
*  What about second? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=194.54s)]
*  How important is it for, say, Governor DeSantis to come in second tonight? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=195.66s)]
*  It's very close at this time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=199.14s)]
*  It is irrelevant. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=200.14s)]
*  It's... [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=201.14s)]
*  Look, it's like, you know, being the nicest person in the school while you lose every [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=202.14s)]
*  game. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=207.14s)]
*  Fine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=208.14s)]
*  I mean, he can go home and say he did the best he could. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=209.14s)]
*  Nikki can go home and say she did the best she could. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=211.98s)]
*  Rama Swamin can go home and say he did the best he could. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=214.38s)]
*  None of them are going to be the nominee, period. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=217.14s)]
*  It is over. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=220.46s)]
*  If you had any doubt about this, watch the returns come in tonight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=221.74s)]
*  This will be historically the largest margin ever for a Republican candidate in a multi-candidate [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=225.38s)]
*  field, ever. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=231.9s)]
*  Last question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=232.9s)]
*  And at some point, people got to say to themselves, oh, he is going to be the nominee because, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=233.9s)]
*  not because of him, but because the American people want him to be the nominee. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=238.46s)]
*  He's going to be president because the American people want him to be president. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=244.14s)]
*  Last question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=249.54s)]
*  Polls were a little tighter in New Hampshire. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=250.54s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=252.78s)]
*  It's a different electorate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=253.78s)]
*  Ari Fleischer mentioned that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=255.06s)]
*  Last two polls were Trump up by seven, Trump up by 20. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=257.54s)]
*  There was an outlier poll of him only up by four. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=260.26s)]
*  Does it matter at all what happens in your mind in New Hampshire? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=265.42s)]
*  No. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=268.42s)]
*  No. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=269.42s)]
*  Just asking. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=270.42s)]
*  He's going to be the nominee. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=271.42s)]
*  Look at the way he... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=272.42s)]
*  I'm just asking. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=273.42s)]
*  So he carries, in the worst case, he carries 49 states. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=274.42s)]
*  In the best case, he carries 50. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=277.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=279.98s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, always great to have you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=282.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FucgVFTEymo&t=283.78s)]
