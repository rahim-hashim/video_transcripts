# Alan Dershowitz: Thereâ€™s a plausible case for perjury
**Fox News:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY)
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Turley, thank you tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=1.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=2.96s)]
*  Here now, with more reaction, we have Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, Harvard Law [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=3.96s)]
*  professor Alan Dershowitz is with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=7.48s)]
*  Greg, we'll start with you tonight on a couple of things here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=9.8s)]
*  OK, number one, unqualified, overpaid lead attorney who is in a relationship with the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=12.88s)]
*  DA that's leading this case, benefiting financially from the money that she is approving [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=19.84s)]
*  for payment for this guy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=25.64s)]
*  Why would that not result in not only removal, but if they want to pursue charges down the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=28.32s)]
*  road, that would take a new prosecutor, a new case, a new venue, etc.? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=34.32s)]
*  Well, and I think fresh eyes would say this isn't a racketeering case dismissed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=40.32s)]
*  You know, Fannie Willis, Sean, proved that lawyers make hideous witnesses. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, her lover Nathan Wade's testimony was such a Stooges train wreck that Willis [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=51.04s)]
*  sprinted to the witness stand to try to fix it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=56.52s)]
*  And then she melted down in this tantrum of belligerent rants. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  It was sort of an eerie impression of Cruella DeVille. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=64.64s)]
*  She even screeched at the judge who banged his gavel and had to call a recess. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=68.72s)]
*  Grudgingly, Willis and Wade both admitted their sexual affair, but then they claimed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=74.16s)]
*  ridiculously it didn't start until after he was hired, not before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=79.0s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=83.56s)]
*  Either way, it does not matter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=84.56s)]
*  The affair itself is a severe conflict of interest, an obvious impropriety, a violation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=87.52s)]
*  egregiously of the canons of ethics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=95.16s)]
*  That merits disqualification. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=98.44s)]
*  And if the judge decides that the entire prosecution has been tainted, and I think it has, he can [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=100.44s)]
*  either dismiss the charges or more likely ship it off to another office. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=107.2s)]
*  And if that happens, new prosecutors will surely take a look at this and say, this is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=112.56s)]
*  legally unsound. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=118.64s)]
*  This is not racketeering. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=120.64s)]
*  It would need to be, in my view, Professor, a new venue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=123.78s)]
*  Again, unqualified, overpaid, lead attorney, being paid an exorbitant amount of money, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=127.64s)]
*  the DA benefiting from that money, lavish vacations. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  I believe that this case now needs to be dropped, and I'll take it a step further. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=140.88s)]
*  What happens to all the people that made plea deals? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=145.76s)]
*  A lot of people make plea deals not because they're guilty, because it takes the possibility [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=148.72s)]
*  of jail off the table and removes that pressure. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=154.1s)]
*  Would you agree with that characterization? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=158.72s)]
*  I certainly would. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=162.8s)]
*  And the people who pleaded guilty will probably seek to undo their pleas unless they are satisfied [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  with the result. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=168.24s)]
*  For me, the issue is perjury. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=169.32s)]
*  There is a plausible case, not an ironclad case, a plausible case that the two of them [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=171.88s)]
*  both committed perjury. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=177.76s)]
*  He seems clearly to have committed perjury, if not in the courtroom, in answering his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=180.04s)]
*  interrogatories, where he swore under oath, essentially, that he did not have sex between [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=185.04s)]
*  the time he was married and the date he signed that, admitting, however, that he did have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=190.76s)]
*  when he thought the marriage was broken down. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=196.46s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=199.46s)]
*  The second thing is, this is a she said, they said confrontation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=200.46s)]
*  We have a witness who seems completely plausible who said that she admitted that she had a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=206.86s)]
*  relationship with him during the period of time when she denied doing it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=212.62s)]
*  One witness against two witnesses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=216.96s)]
*  But remember, she testified under oath, hey, all you need for proof is one witness's testimony. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=218.9s)]
*  There was one witness, her friend, who testified that there was sex during the period of time [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=224.36s)]
*  that they denied it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think there's a plausible case for perjury here, but I think there's an open and shut [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  case for disqualification based on the appearance of impropriety. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  Look, when you admit that you paid for all these trips on your credit cards, then the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=239.24s)]
*  burden of proof shifts to the other side to demonstrate that there was payback in cash. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that there are no records and the payments all have records, but the repayments [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  have no records gives rise to a plausible interpretation that that's not true. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=257.14s)]
*  That there was financial benefit that accrued to the district attorney. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=263.24s)]
*  Therefore, there's more than enough for the judge to say, at least in appearance of impropriety, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=267.72s)]
*  total disqualification of the office, start from scratch, put the case in a different [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  district. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=277.92s)]
*  And then we'll see if an independent prosecutor thinks there's enough here for a RICO prosecution. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=278.92s)]
*  Do you believe that will happen? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Exit question for both of you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=286.6s)]
*  Professor, we'll let you go first. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=288.36s)]
*  I'm not hearing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=290.32s)]
*  Professor, okay, do you believe, Greg, do you believe that will happen? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=294.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=300.64s)]
*  I think it's 50-50 that he'll ship it off to a different district attorney's office. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=302.72s)]
*  Maybe he should refer it to the state attorney general for a complete new review. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  And again, as I said before, I'm fairly confident that any rational prosecutor who's independent, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=316.8s)]
*  objective, fair and neutral will look at this case and say, where in the world is there [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=324.08s)]
*  credible evidence that supports a racketeering charge? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think they would conclude there is no evidence here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=336.14s)]
*  All right, professor, real quick, will that happen, what you said? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=340.02s)]
*  There is a case, yes, because there is a case already in the District of Columbia which [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  covers these same issues. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=348.0s)]
*  There is no need for there to be a state case on this, so it should be dismissed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=349.5s)]
*  All right, professor, thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=353.29999999999995s)]
*  Greg, thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0S_yFJhyY&t=355.58s)]
