# Horace Cooper: Trump broke the internet
**Fox News:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw)
*  Project 21 chairman Horace Cooper is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=0.0s)]
*  Let me go to what went on today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=2.7s)]
*  And I'm also, I want to scroll because Kamala Harris does next to zero interviews. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=5.7s)]
*  She doesn't do them even with the major networks, very, very few in the, you know, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=12.6s)]
*  all these months she's been vice president. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  We've actually gone back and we've counted she's done very few. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=20.0s)]
*  And she's not done any since she has, you know, gotten into this position. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=23.7s)]
*  But if you look at all of these questions about her, she, nobody's asking her. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=28.9s)]
*  And now she's flipping, flopping and flailing and nobody's asking about that either. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=33.3s)]
*  And it seems like the protective bubble or Biden in the basement is going to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=38.1s)]
*  the media strategy to do their best to help elect her and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=42.8s)]
*  they'll be the biggest campaign donor to the, Harris run for president. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=46.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=51.6s)]
*  Well, let me give a few observations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=54.5s)]
*  I'm not sure tonight is Kamala Harris night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=57.7s)]
*  Donald Trump broke the internet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=61.2s)]
*  He appeared at this event. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=63.6s)]
*  He stood up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  It was purportedly going to be hostile. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=68.2s)]
*  I saw reports that there were going to be demonstrators and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=71.3s)]
*  all manner, including one of the co-chairman stepping down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=75.4s)]
*  In many instances, it could have been seen like an encounter [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=80.5s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin or the premier of North Korea or [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=86.0s)]
*  some other challenge that a president might face. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=92.2s)]
*  Former president Donald Trump stood up like a boss and went in with his message. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=95.4s)]
*  A second observation is that black Americans have been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=102.4s)]
*  categorized as a bunch of people because they vote in higher numbers [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=107.2s)]
*  as Democrats that they hold the same luxury beliefs that people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=113.1s)]
*  like the progressives that live in the zip codes of Manhattan or [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  suburban DC or San Francisco. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Black Americans have said again and again, they do not support open borders. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=125.6s)]
*  They don't want you to dress it up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=133.9s)]
*  They don't want you to make it sound amazing and pretty and use the proper names. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=135.7s)]
*  They want it to stop. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=141.2s)]
*  Donald Trump recognizes that and that is a message that he delivered. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  If you're a group of black journalists, you ought to be trying to elicit [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  from the people that come before you questions about the issues [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=155.5s)]
*  that actually animate the population luxury beliefs about race and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  about who's a first this or first that aren't relevant to black America. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=167.6s)]
*  This is the 21st century. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=173.4s)]
*  This is not the early 20th century. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well said Horace Cooper. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=179.7s)]
*  We appreciate you as always. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkCTldcKNmw&t=181.79999999999998s)]
