# Americans ‘rejected’ this agenda: Lara Trump
**Fox News:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0)
*  All right, the 2024 election is in the books, but one Democrat is already seemingly gearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=0.0s)]
*  up for 2028. According to a report, Gavin Newsom now plans to take more trips away from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=6.2s)]
*  his state's drug-infested cities and visit California's more rural Trump country to find [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=11.92s)]
*  out why they are rejecting the woke far-left party. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=17.44s)]
*  I guess it's better than the special session to Trump-proof the sanctuary state, the socialist [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=21.84s)]
*  utopia of California. But here with reaction, RNC co-chair Laura Trump, you know, Gavin [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=26.8s)]
*  just might, I do know Gavin Newsom well. If you meet him, you like the guy. However, his [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=33.0s)]
*  policies are simply insane. I mean, a sanctuary state, sanctuary cities, you know, defund, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=39.0s)]
*  dismantle, no-barre laws. They've allowed great cities like San Francisco to be taken [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=48.0s)]
*  over. Stores can be robbed as long as you don't take $1,000 worth of merchandise. And [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=52.68s)]
*  then of course he believes that you can have gender-affirming care for minors without parental [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=58.96s)]
*  consent. It doesn't matter how smart, slick the presentation is, it's still the same failed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=63.88s)]
*  policies. Isn't it the policies that people are going to vote on? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=71.88s)]
*  Yeah, and this is what the American people, Sean, rejected wholesale in this election [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=75.16s)]
*  on November 5th. It's why you saw a movement with a lot of these blue states in a very [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=80.48s)]
*  historic way. I think, you know, Donald Trump cut nine points off of the Democrat advantage [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=85.2s)]
*  in the state of California, which is a solid blue state, we all know. But he did the same [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=90.72s)]
*  thing in states like New York. He did it in New Jersey. He almost won this, you know, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Virginia this election. It's because people have rejected these policies. And look, California [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=100.0s)]
*  is a state that has one of the worst deficits in the entire country. And yet you have Gavin [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=105.16s)]
*  Newsom coming out saying right alongside, by the way, Governor Pritzker, Governor Hockel, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=110.24s)]
*  we are going to fight against Donald Trump. We're willing to spend whatever it is of our [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=115.36s)]
*  taxpayers' money to fight against Donald Trump and his policies. Those are the policies, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Sean, like getting the criminals and the gangs out of our country who are here illegally. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You were just talking about the death of Lakin Reilly. We should never have to see this happen [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=129.72s)]
*  in this country ever again. Donald Trump wants him out. That's why people came out and overwhelming [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=135.12s)]
*  voted for him in this election. And if Democrats don't start to understand that the American [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=140.14s)]
*  people want common sense, not lunacy back, they are going to lose these elections in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=145.82s)]
*  perpetuity. And I would suggest to everybody in California, maybe you guys should start [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=151.14s)]
*  looking at a Republican governor who might get your state back in order. Just a suggestion, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  Sean. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=161.06s)]
*  No, I think so. You know what I'd like to see Republicans do? And I know you're going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=162.06s)]
*  My understanding is that you did your job at the RNC and you're not staying there or [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=166.06s)]
*  you're thinking about it. Where are you on that? You're done? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, I haven't fully decided, but I certainly did what I went to the RNC to do. I, you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=173.46s)]
*  we won the election handily. We made sure that there was no fraud. We made sure that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  there was no cheating. We got people out to vote early. We got our low propensity voters [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=184.02s)]
*  out as well. And so I'm open to see what the future holds for me. We'll see what happens. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=187.86s)]
*  Well, I've asked that question before and everyone else has asked you, so I won't drive [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=193.3s)]
*  you nuts and ask you another time. Just to be fair, I will say this and it's a credit [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=197.5s)]
*  to you and I've known you a long time and everything. When you first were named co-chair [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  of the RNC, you came on this program and I asked you very specific questions about voting [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=209.9s)]
*  by mail and election integrity, partisan observers in every precinct, all over these swing states, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=217.5s)]
*  battleground states, everything you promised this audience on that first interview, you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=225.78s)]
*  were able to fulfill that promise and pull it off. And I don't think, you know, we can [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=232.02s)]
*  thank you enough for all the hard work you and Mike Wotley put in and everybody else. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=237.66s)]
*  Well, that's so nice. We had an incredible team and obviously it was an honor to serve [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=242.62s)]
*  in this role during a critical election. And, you know, it's funny because I did have a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=246.94s)]
*  lot of critics, Sean. I know that's shocking for someone with the last name Trump. A lot [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=251.94s)]
*  of critics. It was for me. Whenever I was elected into this position, they've been oddly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=255.78s)]
*  silent. I'm sure I won't wait for any apologies, but success is obviously the best revenge. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=261.06s)]
*  We know Donald Trump said it and it feels good to be on the other side of this with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=266.66s)]
*  a win under our belts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=270.06s)]
*  And I have to credit Suzy Wiles, the entire campaign team. They did a great job too. And, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=271.06s)]
*  you know, at first I felt a sense of relief. Everybody around me spiked in the football. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=277.06s)]
*  I felt relief and a sense of gratitude. Now I'm kind of in the let's roll up our sleeves [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=281.1s)]
*  and get this job done kind of, you know, in that kind of mood at this point. Laura, great [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=285.86s)]
*  work. Great job. Thanks for being with us. Always great to have you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=291.94s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=300.06s)]
*  else. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnLkkn2Dg0&t=305.14s)]
