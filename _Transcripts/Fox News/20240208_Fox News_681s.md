# Hannity: This is beyond damning for Biden
**Fox News:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=0.0s)]
*  And we begin tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  We are following two massive stories tonight that could rock the 2024 election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=5.64s)]
*  First, the long-awaited special counsel report on President Biden's mishandling of top-secret [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  classified documents from his time as even a senator, but vice president, a have now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  been made public. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=20.8s)]
*  That report, it is beyond damning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=21.96s)]
*  Biden just tried to save face with the American public. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=24.32s)]
*  It was a shocking display of his cognitive decline. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=27.9s)]
*  We're going to play those outrageous remarks in a minute. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=31.3s)]
*  But let's lay out the details in this report, devastating. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=34.98s)]
*  According to the report, quote, President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=39.3s)]
*  materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=44.94s)]
*  Investigators found classified documents, including notebooks from meetings regarding [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=50.86s)]
*  highly sensitive material on foreign policy and national security, carelessly stored in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=55.58s)]
*  what appears to be his garage. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=61.42s)]
*  And while what the special counsel found about Biden's handling of classified documents [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=64.66s)]
*  was alarming, what it says about his cognitive state is, quite frankly, shocking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=68.9s)]
*  And by the way, it should have every single American concerned about the mental health, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=75.7s)]
*  the cognitive health of the president of our country, the president of the United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=80.66s)]
*  And according to the special counsel, the Department of Justice, they are not charging [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=85.56s)]
*  Joe Biden, quote, because Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  Does this mean the special counsel is not charging Biden because of his cognitive decline [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=103.1s)]
*  and would come off as a nice guy? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=108.92s)]
*  I thought the special counsel said he did this willfully. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=111.4s)]
*  And by the way, it gets much worse. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=115.8s)]
*  According to the report, on the first day of Biden's interview, he could not even remember [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=117.72s)]
*  when he was vice president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=122.52s)]
*  He asked the people interviewing him, if it was 2013, when did I stop being vice president? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=124.72s)]
*  He couldn't remember when he took office as vice president, asking this question, in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=131.92s)]
*  2009, am I still vice president? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=137.36s)]
*  And in what probably is the saddest part of the entire report, and it's sad, Joe couldn't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  even remember within a few years when his son, Bo, died. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=145.48s)]
*  And according to the special counsel's findings, Biden's clear cognitive struggles in meetings [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  with his ghostwriter in early 2017, just months after leaving office, as vice president, quote, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=155.04s)]
*  likely appear consistent with the diminished faculties and faulty memory. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, this is scary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=167.16s)]
*  But now, we have been warning you about this for years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=168.68s)]
*  Joe Biden does not have the cognitive strength and ability and mental stamina to take on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=171.28s)]
*  the toughest job in the world, and that's to lead this country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=177.24s)]
*  And I'm not being flippant when I say this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=180.8s)]
*  They are describing a president of the United States who could not be one of those very [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=183.28s)]
*  nice Walmart greeters, because they would be describing a person who would be cognitively [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=189.08s)]
*  incapable of actually remembering where every department is in the store. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  The special counsel is saying loudly that Joe Biden is unfit to be the president. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=201.8s)]
*  Think about what the rest of the world is thinking about this report. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=207.44s)]
*  Joe is in charge of our nuclear weapons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=212.72s)]
*  He's got the nuclear football with him at all times, right next to him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  And tonight, even the media mob, they're struggling to defend him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=219.0s)]
*  NBC News reporting the special counsel's assessment of Joe Biden's mental state has [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=222.56s)]
*  triggered, quote, democratic panic. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post said the report was, quote, paints a scathing picture of Biden's memory. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  And both the USA Today recap of the report and the Axios write-up pointed to the growing [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=236.4s)]
*  questions around Biden's memory concerns. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  And The Hill called it, quote, an eyebrow-raising report when pressed by reporters tonight in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=245.06s)]
*  a bizarre press conference, only answered about three questions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=251.8s)]
*  Biden dismissed questions about his age and his memory. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=259.24s)]
*  President Biden, something the special counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=260.24s)]
*  you were not charged is because in his description you are a well-meaning elderly man with a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=265.68s)]
*  poor memory. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=272.68s)]
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=273.68s)]
*  I've been president. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=278.0s)]
*  I put this country back on its feet. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=279.0s)]
*  I don't need his recommendation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=281.12s)]
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=282.56s)]
*  My memory is so bad I can't let you speak. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=286.96s)]
*  That's the- [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=291.0s)]
*  Do you feel your memory has gotten worse, Mr. President? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=292.0s)]
*  My memory is not- my memory is fine. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  If voters have concerns about your age, how are you going to dissuade them? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  And do you fear that this report is only going to fuel further concerns about your age? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=300.52s)]
*  Only by some of you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=304.76s)]
*  For months when you were asked about your age, you would respond with the words, watch me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=305.76s)]
*  Many American people have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=310.44s)]
*  That is your judgment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=315.44s)]
*  That is your judgment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  This is according to public order. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  That is not the judgment of the press. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  They expressed concerns about your mental acuity. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=320.88s)]
*  They say that you are too old. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=323.16s)]
*  Mr. President, in December you told me that you believe there are many other Democrats [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=324.8s)]
*  who could defeat Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=329.04s)]
*  So why does it have to be you now? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=330.72s)]
*  What is your answer to that question? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  Because I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  and finish the job I started. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=336.64s)]
*  Peter Ducey will join us in just a moment, a very contentious press conference, probably [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=339.6s)]
*  in the—if we look at modern history, the modern level of presidency and the people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=343.8s)]
*  that have served, I can't think of a worse report or a worse press conference than this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=349.8s)]
*  one. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=355.12s)]
*  Now, Joe, if your memory really is fine, then why couldn't you remember the name of the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=356.12s)]
*  church your son's rosary is from? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=359.72s)]
*  He couldn't remember. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=363.12s)]
*  This is at this disastrous press conference after the release of the disastrous report. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=364.76s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=370.02s)]
*  I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=371.02s)]
*  of events. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=375.38s)]
*  There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=376.38s)]
*  How in the hell dare he raise that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=383.0s)]
*  Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=385.0s)]
*  damn business. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=389.4s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=390.4s)]
*  I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of—every [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=395.12s)]
*  Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him, attending by friends and family and the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=404.44s)]
*  people who loved him. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=408.68s)]
*  Our Lady of—I'm not making fun. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=411.84s)]
*  He couldn't remember. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=416.6s)]
*  And that wasn't his only blunder in this short press conference. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=418.04s)]
*  He also called the president of Egypt, the president of Mexico. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=420.48s)]
*  That means President El Sisi. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=425.5s)]
*  The conduct of the response in the Gaza Strip has been over the top. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=426.5s)]
*  I think that, as you know, initially the president of Mexico, El Sisi, did not want to open up [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=442.1s)]
*  the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=453.28s)]
*  I talked to him. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=457.55999999999995s)]
*  I convinced him to open the gate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  The president of Egypt is at time to consider invoking the 25th Amendment. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=462.4s)]
*  Now, you may remember Section 4 of this amendment. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=468.44s)]
*  It authorizes a vice president and a majority of principal officers of the executive departments [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=471.67999999999995s)]
*  to the president pro temp of the Senate and the speaker of the House. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=479.14s)]
*  They're written a declaration that the president is unable to discharge the power and the duties [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=483.58s)]
*  of his office, allowing the vice president to immediately assume the powers and duties [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=489.78s)]
*  of the office as acting president. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, going back to the damning report, Biden, when pressed on why he took the classified [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=497.5s)]
*  material and this angry presser, declared that the notebooks are his, quote, property, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=502.34s)]
*  and that, quote, every president before me has done this exact same thing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=507.98s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=511.98s)]
*  This is almost the exact same argument former President Trump made right here on this show [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=513.26s)]
*  last year, months after investigators conducted their raid of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=518.3000000000001s)]
*  Yet he still faces charges. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, this is why the House judiciary, they are rightly investigating whether Joe Biden's [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=525.34s)]
*  Department of Justice is weaponized, whether or not the DOJ has been politicized. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=530.54s)]
*  And tonight, after the release of the report, Trump called on the special counsel in his [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=536.34s)]
*  case to dismiss all charges related to the classified document issue. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=540.98s)]
*  But sadly, what have we learned? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=546.38s)]
*  If you're Hillary Clinton, if you're Joe Biden, you get one system of justice. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=548.14s)]
*  We have a two-tiered system of justice. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  It's now on full display once again. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=554.62s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, remember her, deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, some with top secret classified [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=557.1800000000001s)]
*  information off her private server. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=563.1s)]
*  She faced no charges. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=565.62s)]
*  And don't forget, we know about the top secret classified documents that James Comey [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=567.5s)]
*  did find, but no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=571.86s)]
*  Now, Joe gets all up without charges, just like Hillary and James Comey. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=575.66s)]
*  He gets—James Comey exonerates Hillary, and Donald Trump gets, let's see, his home [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  raided and charges brought against him. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=586.46s)]
*  Remember, James Comey found tons of classified email on that laptop. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=588.62s)]
*  Top secret classified email. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=594.36s)]
*  It was believed that our enemies might have had access to it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=596.28s)]
*  But first, our other top story tonight. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=599.12s)]
*  We'll get back to this in a minute. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=600.88s)]
*  Earlier today, the Supreme Court, they heard oral arguments over the Colorado attempt to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=602.92s)]
*  ban Donald Trump from that ballot. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=607.76s)]
*  And it was a disaster from start to finish for the leftists in Colorado. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=609.96s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=614.16s)]
*  If Colorado's position is upheld, surely there will be disqualification proceedings [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=615.52s)]
*  on the other side. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=621.88s)]
*  I would expect that a goodly number of states will say, whoever the Democratic candidate [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=623.12s)]
*  is, you're off the ballot, and others, for the Republican candidate, you're off the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=629.76s)]
*  ballot, and it'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=634.64s)]
*  election. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=639.12s)]
*  That's a pretty daunting consequence. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=640.12s)]
*  What about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=643.02s)]
*  to elect candidates of their choice, of letting the people decide, because your position has [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=649.6s)]
*  the effect of disenfranchising voters to a significant degree. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  The question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=661.88s)]
*  to be president of the United States. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN1uIR-9yE8&t=666.58s)]
