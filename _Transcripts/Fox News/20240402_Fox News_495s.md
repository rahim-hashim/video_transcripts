**Fox News:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY)
*  All right, legendary boxer Mike Tyson is getting back in the ring. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's 58 years old. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=4.84s)]
*  He's facing off against YouTuber, turned boxer, 27-year-old Jake Paul. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=6.12s)]
*  Now, the last time Tyson fought, that was back in 2020. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=10.84s)]
*  That marked his first professional fight in over 15 years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=14.48s)]
*  Tyson recently released a pretty intimidating training video that shows you don't want to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=17.92s)]
*  be punched by Mike Tyson. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=22.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=24.36s)]
*  One more. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=25.36s)]
*  One more. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=26.36s)]
*  Day three. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=27.36s)]
*  You still want to **** with me? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=28.36s)]
*  All right, the fight's going to take place July 20th. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=29.36s)]
*  It's going to be in Arlington, Texas, streamed on Netflix, here now with more. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=42.24s)]
*  Former heavyweight champion, the one and only Mike Tyson. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=47.04s)]
*  Good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  What's up, Sean? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Listen, will you please promise me you're going to kick this guy's ass and shut him [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  up, please? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=58.24s)]
*  Hey, I would do just that for you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=61.24s)]
*  So you're going out, you're going to do it for me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=65.80000000000001s)]
*  All right, I watched your training video. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  I know you're in super shape. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=70.88s)]
*  You're going into this fight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=73.48s)]
*  You're nearly twice as old as this guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  Is that an advantage for him? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=79.84s)]
*  Younger, faster? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=81.64s)]
*  Although you look, you know, you looked like you were on your A game in the video. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, do you feel? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=87.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=91.28s)]
*  I don't think he's faster than me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=92.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=95.64s)]
*  How hard are you training? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=97.16s)]
*  I train every day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=102.56s)]
*  How many hours a day you're training? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  Hey, I'm taking it serious. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, listen, it's the whole day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  The process goes through the whole day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=109.12s)]
*  I get up in the morning, do the road work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Then I go to the gym at one. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Then I go to the strength and conditioning guy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=115.08s)]
*  Then it starts all over again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=117.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  So Jake Paul is saying he wants to be a world champion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  He says you're the greatest heavyweight champion ever, the baddest man on the planet and the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=124.68s)]
*  most dangerous boxer of all time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=131.72s)]
*  This will be the fight of a lifetime. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=135.12s)]
*  You've had a chance to assess Jake Paul. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=137.12s)]
*  What do you think of his boxing ability? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's, you know, he's came a long way from YouTube. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=142.76s)]
*  And listen, I've seen a YouTube of him at 16 doing weird dances. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=146.88s)]
*  That's not the guy I'm going to be fighting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=151.56s)]
*  This guy's going to come. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=153.04s)]
*  He's going to try to hurt me, which I'm accustomed to. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  And he's going to be greatly mistaken. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=157.12s)]
*  Let's talk about, there's been a lot of rumors out there about the fight that maybe, you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=160.8s)]
*  got to have 18 ounce gloves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=166.2s)]
*  You're going to be wearing headgear. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=168.12s)]
*  Any truth to that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=169.56s)]
*  No, not true at all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=170.56s)]
*  Not true. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=171.56s)]
*  Not true. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=172.56s)]
*  No true. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=173.56s)]
*  Listen, this is called an exhibition. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=174.56s)]
*  But if you look up exhibition, you will not see any of the laws that we're fighting under. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  This is a fight. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=185.2s)]
*  You're going in, this is a real fight, and you're going in to win this fight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=188.44s)]
*  What is bringing you back? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=194.16s)]
*  What is luring you back in? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=196.28s)]
*  Is it kind of like the last Rocky movie and you got stuff in the basement, you need to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=197.28s)]
*  get it out? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=201.52s)]
*  You know, Sean, I have a weird personality. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=202.52s)]
*  I don't think it's weird, though. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  Whatever I'm afraid to do, I do it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=209.24s)]
*  And that's how it is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  I was afraid for the Roy, I was scared to fight again. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  I was 100 pounds overweight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=215.68s)]
*  I was however old, 54, 53. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=217.28000000000003s)]
*  And I said, let's do it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=220.28000000000003s)]
*  Anything I'm afraid of, I confront it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=222.48s)]
*  And that's my personality. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=225.92s)]
*  Like, right now, I'm scared to death. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=226.92s)]
*  But as the fight gets closer, the less nervous I become because it's reality. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=229.56s)]
*  And in reality, I'm invincible. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  I think the people hearing that Mike Tyson is scared to death, it's kind of reminiscent [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=238.72s)]
*  of the last Rocky movie, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=246.72s)]
*  He goes, I'm scared to death. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=248.88s)]
*  Champ Arnott, you're afraid? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm afraid of nothing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  That didn't work out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=255.6s)]
*  Did you feel that fear or that—maybe it's a sense of failure or potential failure all [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  your career? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=261.36s)]
*  No, it's a sign of victory. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=262.36s)]
*  And that helped drive you through all of those matches, all those wins you had? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=267.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=272.36s)]
*  I always believe the adversity—I always believe the adversity or nervousness, it pretty [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=273.36s)]
*  much counterpoked me into success. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=277.92s)]
*  If I didn't have these feelings, I wouldn't go into this fight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  I have to have these feelings to fight. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=285.92s)]
*  Without them, I would never go in the ring. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=287.68s)]
*  Yeah, I hope you don't have those feelings of fear about me one day, because I don't [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=290.32s)]
*  really feel like getting in the ring with you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=294.92s)]
*  One of those Mike Tyson left hooks is going to knock me right back to— [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to fight you either, Sean. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=301.56s)]
*  I don't want to fight you either. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=302.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=303.56s)]
*  Well, you know, Jim Gray, our mutual friend, actually started our friendship, and what [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=305.2s)]
*  a great guy he is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=313.0s)]
*  And this is what he says about you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=314.32s)]
*  He says, you are the nicest guy on earth. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=315.32s)]
*  Nicest guy, one of the nicest people he ever met. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=318.76s)]
*  And I read something. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=321.96s)]
*  I know—I'll talk a little bit about your business. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=322.96s)]
*  You've gotten into the weed-edible business, and you actually have, you know—you call [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=324.92s)]
*  it Mike's Bites. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  It's shaped like an ear, obviously referring to Evander Holyfield and the fight you had [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  back then. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=335.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=336.96s)]
*  And this is what you said that really interested me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=337.96s)]
*  You said that it makes you a different person, and you want to offer this medicinal help [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  to others looking for emotional and physical relief. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  This is medicinal for you, correct? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=351.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=354.96s)]
*  Not only myself, but many, many millions and millions and hundreds of millions of people [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=357.28s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=361.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=363.28s)]
*  You actually said if I don't use it for a week or three days, you're a totally different [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=364.28s)]
*  person. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  And this is what you said about yourself. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  You're not a likable person. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  What happens if you don't have the medication? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=379.4s)]
*  Maybe it has something to do with my tripolar tendencies or something. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=380.4s)]
*  I don't think I'll be smoking for this fight, and I think I'm going to be really, really [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=386.92s)]
*  irritable and nasty. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if irritable and nasty might actually help you in the ring. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=394.12s)]
*  You know, maybe it pissed off Mike. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  So you're launching this new line. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  Is this something you would even—would you take this before the fight, for example? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=403.92s)]
*  Normally I do. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  At this particular fight, I think I'm going to go pretty raw and, you know, naked. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah, without all of it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  All right, so the fight's coming up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=421.32s)]
*  You're training. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any dislike for Jake Paul? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, do you want to teach him a lesson? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=428.64s)]
*  I would do just that, but dislike him? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=435.52s)]
*  I do not have no grudges against him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=436.52s)]
*  He's beautiful. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=439.12s)]
*  And no, it's not from that perspective. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=440.12s)]
*  This is from my point of view of grabbing glory. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=442.52s)]
*  You know, never for money, only glory. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=449.08s)]
*  I would never risk my health for money. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=452.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=455.24s)]
*  And you obviously feel like you're in the best shape. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  I know I speak for a lot of people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=459.28s)]
*  They want to see Mike Tyson— [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=461.52s)]
*  I mean, really, I won't—I'll be in better shape July 20th. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=462.52s)]
*  They want to see Mike Tyson win this fight. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=463.52s)]
*  And my guess is you're going to—this is going to be a great night. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=466.76s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  Definitely one for the ages. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=471.68s)]
*  I believe you as well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=472.68s)]
*  I'm looking so forward to it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=473.68s)]
*  I'm looking so forward to it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=474.68s)]
*  I respect anybody that gets in the ring of the octagon. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=477.36s)]
*  Great respect. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=480.36s)]
*  Ouse. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=481.36s)]
*  Mike Tyson, thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xInUaRVhY&t=482.36s)]
