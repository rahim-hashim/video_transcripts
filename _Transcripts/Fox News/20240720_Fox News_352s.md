# I don’t ‘trust the FBI and the Secret Service’: Sen. Josh Hawley
**Fox News:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc)
*  Josh Hawley actually traveled to Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=0.0s)]
*  He met with local officials to see firsthand the building and the sniper, the one they [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=3.5s)]
*  scaled trying to assassinate President Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=8.86s)]
*  Senator Hawley joins us now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=12.86s)]
*  Senator, my understanding is, it hardly was a pitch roof. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=14.14s)]
*  I can look at it and tell you as a guy that fell off a roof three stories, it's not a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=17.22s)]
*  pitch roof. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Number one. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=23.8s)]
*  Number two, if they knew it was a threat and they didn't want their agents on it, I could [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  live with that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=28.82s)]
*  Why weren't there sniper eyes on it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=30.04s)]
*  Why weren't there agents surrounding the perimeter? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=34.06s)]
*  Why did they keep telling us it's outside the perimeter? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=37.88s)]
*  A hundred and thirty yards is not outside the perimeter. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=40.94s)]
*  The perimeter would be defined as any distance that any harm can be brought to a primary, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=44.34s)]
*  in this case Donald Trump, that you're protecting. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=51.14s)]
*  And why are they blaming local law enforcement? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=54.42s)]
*  It's not their job. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=57.12s)]
*  Well I can tell you, Sean, I saw it today ahead of the Senate committee hearings on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=64.2s)]
*  I went to go see myself. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=65.2s)]
*  I went to the grounds. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=66.2s)]
*  I went to the site because frankly I don't trust the FBI and the Secret Service to give [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=67.2s)]
*  us the real story. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  I want to see it myself. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  And you are right, that roof, it's hardly pitched at all. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  It's at a slight slant. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=75.84s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, Sean, I couldn't believe how close it is to where Trump was. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=77.92s)]
*  I stood right where Trump stood, looked over at that building. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=81.96s)]
*  I mean it is a hundred, hundred and fifty yards max. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  It is a clear line of sight from where President Trump was to that building. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  And the whistleblowers, Sean, what they have told me is unbelievable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  It's that they were not patrolling the perimeter with canines as they were supposed to do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  They were not patrolling the crowd. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=102.48s)]
*  They weren't adequately keeping the area around the stage safe. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=104.12s)]
*  And of course we know that they didn't have eyes on that roof and that building. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=110.92000000000002s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=111.92000000000002s)]
*  What else would these whistleblowers are telling you that is most alarming to you? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=113.88s)]
*  Well one thing is that most of the detail assigned to Trump that day into that rally [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=120.92s)]
*  were not Secret Service. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=125.24s)]
*  That most of them were from other federal agencies including Homeland Security. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=127.08s)]
*  And Sean, they weren't prepared. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=131.04s)]
*  They didn't know what the procedures were. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=132.92s)]
*  They did not have the site locked down. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=134.68s)]
*  They were not adequately patrolling the perimeter. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  As you just said a moment ago, they were leaving huge gaps. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=139.12s)]
*  Whistleblowers also tell us that they were allowing people to come into the grounds [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=142.44s)]
*  who weren't checked. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=145.8s)]
*  They weren't monitoring who was getting up around the stage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=146.8s)]
*  I mean it's unbelievable, Sean. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=149.16s)]
*  And having been there today myself, I can tell you it is so close. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=150.84s)]
*  That building where the shooter fired from is so close to where Trump was. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=155.22s)]
*  The idea that you could have all of this time elapse and nobody notices, no law enforcement [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=159.68s)]
*  notices he's on the roof. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=165.18s)]
*  One other thing, Sean, whistleblowers tell me that law enforcement were actually on different [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  channels, different radio communication channels. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  There were multiple different channels and they weren't coordinated. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Sean, it's a total disaster. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  Somebody needs to resign for this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=179.48s)]
*  Well the Secret Service director needs to be fired. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=181.72s)]
*  But they knew there was a suspect. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=185.0s)]
*  The guy had a range finder for crying out loud. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=187.28s)]
*  Who carries around a range finder with them? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  How stupid is this director? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=193.0s)]
*  Well we didn't want to put the officers at risk so we put them inside the building but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  not outside the perimeter of the building to make sure nobody got on top of the roof [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=200.18s)]
*  of the building. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=204.5s)]
*  And why, you're telling me that it was mostly not Secret Service and why are they blaming [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=205.5s)]
*  again local police? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=212.02s)]
*  That's not their job. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=214.38s)]
*  It's the job of the Secret Service. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=216.68s)]
*  They don't have enough resources. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=218.9s)]
*  Well maybe we could take some money back from Ukraine and apply it to the Secret Service [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=220.9s)]
*  and protect every elected official. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=225.86s)]
*  And I tell you what Sean, what local authorities told me here today, I talked to local law [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=229.68s)]
*  enforcement and what they told me is they are angry that they're getting unfairly blamed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=233.68s)]
*  What they told me is, well listen, we did our job. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=238.72s)]
*  We did what we were asked to do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  The Secret Service wasn't prepared. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  They didn't give them clear instructions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=244.38s)]
*  Locals are saying don't roll this over onto us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  You should take some responsibility Secret Service and they should. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  And your point about Ukraine is right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=252.56s)]
*  We can spend how many billions on Ukraine but we can't protect an American president? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=253.8s)]
*  I mean what's going on around here? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=258.12s)]
*  We've got to get the facts Sean and I tell you what, I won't rest until we get them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  No and I appreciate all that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=264.32s)]
*  By the way, where are your fellow Democrats? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=266.20000000000005s)]
*  Their silence is deafening to me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Why aren't they more outraged over this? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=270.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=273.44s)]
*  I mean I just don't get it at all but I tell you one thing, today Sean, when I went to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=274.44s)]
*  the site, the FBI has got more security on that site now than they did the night that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=278.04s)]
*  Trump was shot at. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=283.92s)]
*  I mean the FBI, totally late and they're trying to control the information. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=285.48s)]
*  Sean, they tried to kick me off of the site. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=289.24s)]
*  They said get out of here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=292.12s)]
*  You shouldn't be on the site. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=293.56s)]
*  We don't want you here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=295.0s)]
*  Get out of here? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=296.0s)]
*  They are trying to control the information. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=297.0s)]
*  Get out of here? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=298.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=299.0s)]
*  They brought local cops, Sean, get this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=300.0s)]
*  I'm there on site. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  I had permission from the local security operator to be there and the FBI came out and said [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=303.52s)]
*  you have got to leave. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=309.92s)]
*  We do not want you here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=311.82s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=313.2s)]
*  I want to hear from the FBI director. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=314.24s)]
*  I want to hear from the secret service director. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=316.4s)]
*  I want to hear from Mayorkas, Department of Homeland Security secretary. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=318.8s)]
*  I want to hear from other Democrats. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=322.76s)]
*  I don't want any politician to get shot like this and I don't care if you're a Republican, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  a Democrat, liberal, conservative. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  It is meaningless. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=333.12s)]
*  Protect elected officials. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=334.32s)]
*  Senator, great job. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  I can't believe they tried to kick you off. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIAeFnckc&t=337.88s)]
