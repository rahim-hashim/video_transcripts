# Sen. Rick Scott: We need to get the Trump agenda done
**Fox News:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A)
*  more on his bid for Majority Leader Florida Senator Rick Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=0.0s)]
*  I have nothing against the other candidates, but I do know this about you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=4.32s)]
*  You are a get-it-done, no-holds-barred businessman that fully supports the Trump agenda, and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=8.26s)]
*  I know you would fight for that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=16.16s)]
*  And unfortunately, we have too many people that don't have the wherewithal that you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=18.32s)]
*  do, and I'm not sure if the other candidates would be strong enough. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=22.96s)]
*  I'm supporting you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=26.68s)]
*  You have a lot of other people supporting you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=28.32s)]
*  Tell us why you should get that job. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=30.6s)]
*  Well, first, thank you for your support. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=32.44s)]
*  I'm a business guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=35.52s)]
*  Successful business guys get things done. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=37.16s)]
*  I want the Donald Trump agenda implemented. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=39.6s)]
*  I want his nominees confirmed as quickly as we can get those nominees confirmed so we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=42.68s)]
*  can get to work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=47.64s)]
*  He's got great nominees. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=48.64s)]
*  I hope it's true about Marco Rubio. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=50.2s)]
*  My friend is going to be Secretary of State. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=51.8s)]
*  I hope that's all true. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=53.8s)]
*  We've got to get his agenda done. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=55.2s)]
*  We're going to be able to do some things through reconciliation, everything we can [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=57.4s)]
*  do. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=60.72s)]
*  We need to maximize everything we can do to help Donald Trump get his agenda done. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=61.72s)]
*  We had a great Tuesday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=65.92s)]
*  We had a great Tuesday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=66.92s)]
*  We can all be way more exciting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=68.68s)]
*  But if we don't have the right leader in the Senate, then what's going to happen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=70.58s)]
*  is all the things that Donald Trump wants to do is going to get bogged down, not going [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=74.92s)]
*  to happen, nominees won't get done. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  So I am absolutely committed to do whatever it takes to get his nominees confirmed and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=80.92s)]
*  get his agenda passed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=85.6s)]
*  Let me talk. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Why is this vote secret? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Why is it not public? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=94.28s)]
*  You know, it's just I have no idea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=96.36s)]
*  It's just why are we rushing to have the vote in one week? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=98.8s)]
*  Why do we wait so all the new senators get, you know, get more knowledgeable about the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  job? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  No, it's McConnell rushing these things. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  So it's just the way it's been, and people put up with it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=113.04s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=116.48s)]
*  I'm not putting up with it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=117.48s)]
*  I ran against McConnell two years ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=118.48s)]
*  We're going to win because I've talked to my colleagues. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=119.76s)]
*  They want change. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  They want to be treated like real senators. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  They want to have an agenda. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=126.98s)]
*  They want to get something accomplished. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=128.58s)]
*  They want to go home. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=130.4s)]
*  When we go home on a Friday, they want to say, I busted my butt and something good happened [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=131.4s)]
*  in the Donald Trump agenda. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=136.16s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=137.16s)]
*  The magic number would be 27. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you believe you have 27 votes? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=141.04s)]
*  Now if you don't get to the magic number, then one candidate who has the least amount [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  of votes will drop out, then it would be a two-person race. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=150.76s)]
*  Do you believe you have 27 votes? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  I think I will get 27 votes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=157.2s)]
*  A lot of people have just not said where they are right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=158.76s)]
*  A lot of my colleagues have said they haven't said where they are. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=162.12s)]
*  We're going to have a nice discussion. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=167.76s)]
*  Mike Lee puts together tomorrow night. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm hoping to convince those that are unconvinced. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=170.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=172.88s)]
*  Senator Rick Scott, we appreciate it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=175.16s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4qRr4jr8A&t=176.84s)]
