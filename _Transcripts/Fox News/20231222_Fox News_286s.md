# Jonathan Turley: SCOTUS ruled they're not going to treat Trump differently
**Fox News:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tammy Bruce. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=3.16s)]
*  And for Sean, it's the Friday before Christmas, and the U.S. Supreme Court just offered up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=4.16s)]
*  a giant lump of coal to Biden's DOJ in order to fast-track its case against former [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=9.52s)]
*  President Trump out of Washington, D.C., and get a verdict before the 2024 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=15.16s)]
*  Federal prosecutors frantically asked the court for an expedited review of Trump's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=21.36s)]
*  presidential immunity claims. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=25.92s)]
*  Today, that request was flat-out denied, and many experts are saying there is little chance [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=27.92s)]
*  that this case will go to trial before the election. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=33.08s)]
*  Here now with the very latest George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=36.96s)]
*  Turley. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=41.96s)]
*  Jonathan, your columns are always informative. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=42.96s)]
*  I'm always tweeting them out, telling people to read the whole thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=46.28s)]
*  You know, look, this was not necessarily a complete surprise, but give us your point [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  of view with your legal background, what this really means and how good of a Christmas gift [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=55.56s)]
*  this is to President Trump. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  What was not a surprise, many of us felt that this was the correct decision. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=64.68s)]
*  What the court did is it stayed with regular order. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=70.14s)]
*  It said that, you know, you haven't stated grounds why we should deny this defendant [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=74.04s)]
*  an entire layer of appeal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  That's what Smith was doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  He was saying, I don't want you to allow Trump to have his case heard before the D.C. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=82.24s)]
*  Circuit. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=87.72s)]
*  Well, that has a huge impact on a defendant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=88.72s)]
*  You know, that's part of the record that goes to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  There could be concessions made in oral argument. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=94.42s)]
*  There could be mistakes made in oral argument. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=96.64s)]
*  But more importantly, you have more eyes looking at this issue as these appellate judges state [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=99.0s)]
*  their view. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=105.24s)]
*  So what the court did is it said, we're not going to treat Trump differently because he's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=106.88s)]
*  And you haven't stated a reason why this has to be expedited. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  And so all Smith was saying is that, look, this is a really, really, really, really important [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=116.76s)]
*  case. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  And what the court was saying is that, all right, well, why, if it's important, why [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  shouldn't we take the time to make sure we get it right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see exactly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the one argument was because it's important, we should rush this through in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  a blur. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  And Trump's argument was because it's important, you want to look at it more carefully. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=137.64s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't that be the natural thing? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  In addition to what you've said, which is the natural process that everyone gets to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=146.92s)]
*  go through the appellate court, the Supreme Court sees the issue mature, if you will, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  and then they hear those other issues and thoughts, and then they'll make a decision [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  if they have to. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  But wasn't it obvious at this point? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=165.0s)]
*  Didn't this really kind of highlight the partisan nature of what Smith is doing here? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=167.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, the whole argument that this is so important, you should have less judicial [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=173.64s)]
*  review really didn't sit well, obviously, with the court. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=181.28s)]
*  They didn't share this sense of urgency. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=184.68s)]
*  But more importantly, knocking out an entire level of review for a defendant is no small [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=186.64s)]
*  matter to that defendant. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  So I think that they did stick with regular order. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=195.0s)]
*  Now, is this going to upset the plans of Jack Smith? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=197.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you crunch the numbers on this, it's not good. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, so you now have an oral argument set in January. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=206.96s)]
*  Even if they put this on the rocket docket and get out a decision in a week or two, Trump [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=211.8s)]
*  can appeal for an in-bank review, which is the larger court. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=218.44s)]
*  They have to file those briefs, and it has to be reviewed by those judges. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=223.64s)]
*  That's pushing you into February. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=229.32s)]
*  Then you can—then Trump is allowed to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=232.32s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court sticks with regular order, that can take months. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  So the March date is gone in all practicality. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=239.64s)]
*  But so, too, may be the chances before the general election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, again, this is a very serious issue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Why you would want to tie it to an election? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=251.16s)]
*  Smith says he worries that, you know, Trump would be president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=253.4s)]
*  Well, then that is a given, or at least they're admitting that this is a man who the majority [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=256.24s)]
*  of Americans might want to have be president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=260.96s)]
*  So this is good news, regardless of what you think of Donald Trump, that this is about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=263.56s)]
*  regular order, despite the efforts to change that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=268.52s)]
*  Professor Turley, thank you very much for joining me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCc1ozbSdM&t=271.32s)]
