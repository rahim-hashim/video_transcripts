# Hannity: This is a national security disaster in the making
**Fox News:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM)
*  All right, you may think Joe Biden's border crisis cannot get any worse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=0.0s)]
*  Think again. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=4.84s)]
*  It turns out the Department of Homeland Security is aware of a human smuggling operation that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=5.84s)]
*  has gotten about 400 people into the U.S., obviously illegally and unvetted. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=11.06s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=17.36s)]
*  One of the smugglers running the operation, allegedly now they believe has ties to ISIS. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=18.5s)]
*  Yes, you heard me correctly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=24.2s)]
*  ISIS, the terror organization. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  It's convert or die ISIS. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=29.0s)]
*  And while the agency is desperately trying to track down any potential terrorists that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=31.12s)]
*  might be among the 400, at least 50 are still at large and could be anywhere around the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=35.12s)]
*  country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  What about the other 200? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  They only caught 150 of them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  This is the same smuggling operation that is responsible for bringing in the eight men [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=45.18s)]
*  from Tajikistan, who were reportedly planning a terrorist attack on our homeland. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=50.46s)]
*  Here with reaction, senior fellow at the Hoover Institute of Victor Davis Hansen, Fox News [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=57.6s)]
*  contributor Sarah Carter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=62.6s)]
*  Let's get the full report, Sarah, first, then we'll get commentary from Victor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=64.08s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, it appears that our government is gaslighting the American people when it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=67.64s)]
*  acts like they are struggling to find where these 50 have disappeared from, these 50 so-called [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=72.76s)]
*  illegal aliens that are linked to terrorists, this ISIS smuggling group, because our government [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=79.68s)]
*  has known from the beginning, Sean, has known from the beginning when Biden first took office [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=84.08s)]
*  and basically overran and removed all of President Trump's executive orders on the border, the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=89.72s)]
*  potential threat that existed at the southern border. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  And this is very serious. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=99.96s)]
*  I spoke to intelligence sources today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=101.1s)]
*  I spoke to people within the military and people overseas that are saying there is increased [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=103.36s)]
*  chatter across the globe, that this is the reason why the FBI right now in the United [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=108.24s)]
*  States has such a heightened alert. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=113.58s)]
*  And they have known this for some time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=116.1s)]
*  There is no one to blame for this crisis right now but the Biden administration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=118.38s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I got to tell you, there is concern right now that the 50 that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=122.82s)]
*  are missing are linked directly to terrorist organizations with throughout the globe linked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=127.22s)]
*  to ISIS. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=133.54s)]
*  So there is a struggle now to find them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=134.54s)]
*  And Majorcas's recent statement that everything is fine is also another gaslighting attempt [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=137.02s)]
*  because Majorcas understands that it was his policy and Biden's that allowed all these [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=143.38s)]
*  people to come into the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, Victor Davis Hanson, it is not complicated. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=149.94s)]
*  This is simple, basic, fundamental, common sense, and it's not political. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=153.88s)]
*  This is about the safety and security of every American. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=158.34s)]
*  That would mean Democrat. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=161.58s)]
*  That would mean Republican. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=162.9s)]
*  That would mean liberal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=164.06s)]
*  That would mean conservative. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=165.06s)]
*  But when you have people from over 180 countries and people coming from Iran and Syria and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=167.06s)]
*  Egypt and Afghanistan, tens and tens of thousands, nearly 60,000 in 18 months from China and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=175.02s)]
*  Russia and others from Venezuela, why would we expect any less? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=181.9s)]
*  And you have 11 million total unvetted Joe Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=187.54s)]
*  This is a national security disaster in the making. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=192.14s)]
*  Why would they expect anything other than this report? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, they have a different agenda, Sean. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=199.94s)]
*  Their agenda is to let as many people into the United States as quickly as possible as [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  their legacy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  And they look at the murders of these wonderful people, these citizens, beautiful mother of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=210.5s)]
*  five or teenage girls, or the entrance of terrorists. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=215.18s)]
*  That pales in comparison with that agenda. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=218.94s)]
*  Why don't they tell the Mexican government, these people are coming from all over the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=220.82s)]
*  world, many of them are flying into Mexico City. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=225.82s)]
*  Can't you have rudimentary background? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=228.9s)]
*  Why do they think people are flying into the Mexico City airport? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=232.34s)]
*  What was the purpose of that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=234.98s)]
*  And there's something about their inability to say something about radical Islam. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=236.7s)]
*  We saw that with the Israeli Gaza tragedy, and they pressured Israel more than Hamas. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=241.94s)]
*  The only thing that seems to excite Mr. Mallorca is if there's a false rumor that border patrol [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  agents are whipping Haitian immigrants, which was totally false, but really animated him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=253.74s)]
*  and Biden in a way that these terrorists or these deaths of American citizens don't. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=258.38s)]
*  And you know, today, Wednesday, we had a press conference, Sean, with Secretary of State [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=263.98s)]
*  Blinken and our Obama-era State Department point person on religious liberty, Mr. Hussein. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=268.98s)]
*  And you would think with all of the stuff that has happened in Los Angeles when there [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=275.66s)]
*  are actually, there is no religious liberty in the United States, they're attacking a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=281.06s)]
*  synagogue, what did they talk about? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=284.66s)]
*  They talked about Islamic phobia. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=287.26s)]
*  They talked about everything except anti-Semitism and the attack on religious liberty in their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=289.52s)]
*  own country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=295.02s)]
*  So they have a blind spot on certain issues. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=296.3s)]
*  One is the border is taboo. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=300.18s)]
*  You don't mention it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Another one is the Middle East. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=302.5s)]
*  They will not talk about it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=303.58s)]
*  And they're much more critical of our own border patrol or indifference to people in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=305.74s)]
*  America who are suffering than they are about this open border. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=309.62s)]
*  So you're basically saying that they're willing to sacrifice the lives of Americans. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=314.02s)]
*  You mentioned, you know, we have a young girl in a Queens, New York park, raped in broad [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=318.86s)]
*  daylight and videotaped. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  We have this young girl in Houston, you know, 13 years old. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  I had her mother and grandfather on last night. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=329.38s)]
*  I mean, with all her might, this 12-year-old little girl fought back, was ravaged for two [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=332.1s)]
*  hours and then slaughtered. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=337.62s)]
*  You have Rachel Morin, the mother of five, you have Blake and Riley, and I scroll the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=340.1s)]
*  names. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=344.66s)]
*  You're saying that they don't care? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=345.66s)]
*  How is, I mean, where is your heart, your conscience, your soul, if you don't care? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=346.66s)]
*  It's not that they don't care, it's that they— [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=349.66s)]
*  This is their policy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=350.66s)]
*  This is their policy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=351.66s)]
*  They do two things, Sean. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=352.66s)]
*  They say—yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=353.66s)]
*  Yeah, Victor, go ahead. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=354.66s)]
*  They say that most migrants don't do—they say most immigrants don't do this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=355.66s)]
*  They say most immigrants don't do this or the crime rates—they don't have any data [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=360.66s)]
*  because they don't know who's here and they don't know how many. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  So that's a false argument. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  But the other thing that they do is they don't understand that these people are guests. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=369.82000000000005s)]
*  When you have somebody come into your house and they trash the house, you expect better [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=374.26000000000005s)]
*  of them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=378.66s)]
*  These people, we don't want anybody to commit a crime that comes in the United States. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=379.66s)]
*  They're guests and they're unwanted guests. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=383.42s)]
*  So any one incident should shock them and say, my God, they came in without an invitation, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=386.66s)]
*  they broke their law and they're doing these bad things. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=391.22s)]
*  And we don't care about the percentages. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  It should be zero tolerance. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=396.1s)]
*  But they keep citing this false data that, oh, it's no worse than anybody else, therefore [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=398.06s)]
*  we'll open the border. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  I thought every life mattered, sir. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=406.26000000000005s)]
*  Carter, you get the last word. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=407.86s)]
*  Look, Sean, I covered the war in Afghanistan for years. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=409.38s)]
*  I spent a lot of time on the war zone and President Biden left behind billions of dollars [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=412.82s)]
*  in military equipment. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=418.94s)]
*  He's armed these terrorist organizations overseas and now he's opened our border and put every [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=420.74s)]
*  American life at risk. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=427.14s)]
*  That is the facts. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=429.02s)]
*  We see it before our eyes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=430.02s)]
*  And unless something changes come November, it's going to be far worse. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=431.62s)]
*  If you're going to do a compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VOtQtp7LIM&t=442.74s)]
