# Sean Hannity: Bad news for the Kamala Harris campaign
**Fox News:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight the Democratic National Convention is now finally over, thankfully. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=0.0s)]
*  But there wasn't anything really Democratic about it, was there? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=5.66s)]
*  Kamala Harris was coronated after winning zero primary votes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=9.0s)]
*  Last night's acceptance speech was short on details, full of a lot of lies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=13.46s)]
*  And what was missing more than anything else was any list of accomplishments she could [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=18.54s)]
*  cite that she has achieved over the last three and a half years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=23.16s)]
*  Now, the reason for this is simple. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=27.0s)]
*  There are no accomplishments. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=29.58s)]
*  Harris, Biden, economic policies, they have failed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=31.06s)]
*  You feel it every day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  Their immigration policies have resulted in murder, in rape and violence, and it's costing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=35.5s)]
*  all of you billions of dollars every single year. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=41.3s)]
*  Harris-Biden energy policies are breaking the bank for over half the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  They don't need to be this high. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  Their support of defund, dismantle, no bail laws are similarly a disaster for the—we, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=50.82s)]
*  the people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=56.66s)]
*  Harris-Biden foreign policy has frankly emboldened every bad actor on the world stage. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=57.94s)]
*  But Kamala's speech convention, that was frankly just one big con, con artist Kamala [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=63.5s)]
*  from beginning to end, including, you know, we're supposed to have a big surprise guest, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=70.02s)]
*  one that never appeared, because they wanted people to watch Kamala. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=74.9s)]
*  The party of joy, which cracks me up, and freedom showed nothing but hatred of one man, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=78.42s)]
*  Donald Trump, the entire convention. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=86.34s)]
*  They weren't talking about the issues to make your life better. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=88.1s)]
*  As I said last night, their hope is your hatred, or their hatred of rage, will be conveyed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  to you in such a way that it will transfer to you, and you will hate Donald Trump more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=96.38s)]
*  than success, prosperity and security for you and your family. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=101.5s)]
*  We'll get into all that in a moment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=105.7s)]
*  But first, bad news for the Harris campaign tonight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=107.42s)]
*  Just one day after the fever dream that was the DNC, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made the decision [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=110.46s)]
*  to suspend his campaign, withdrawing his name from the ballot in 10 swing states and endorsing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=116.54s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=122.78s)]
*  And moments ago, Kennedy, as we showed you right here on the Fox News Channel, appeared [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=123.78s)]
*  with Donald Trump on stage in Arizona, where the former president vowed to create a commission [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=127.94s)]
*  to investigate presidential assassinations, an investigation into chronic diseases and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=133.86s)]
*  much, much more, things we really need to know and do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=139.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=143.78s)]
*  We are both in this to do what's right for the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=145.22s)]
*  That's one thing I can tell you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=148.26s)]
*  He lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=154.5s)]
*  to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign while being denied [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=159.78s)]
*  protection by the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=164.98s)]
*  And this is a tribute in honor of Bobby. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=170.26s)]
*  I am announcing tonight that upon my election, I will establish a new independent presidential [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=176.42s)]
*  commission on assassination attempts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  Now before the Trump rally today, during a momentous speech, well, Kennedy spoke openly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=188.98s)]
*  about the political machine that will stop at nothing to keep, consolidate power. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=194.18s)]
*  At all costs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=199.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=201.06s)]
*  What most alarms me isn't how the Democratic Party conducts its internal affairs or runs [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  its candidates. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  What alarms me is the resort to censorship and media control and the weaponization of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  the federal agencies. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  When a U.S. president colludes with or outright coerces media companies to censor political [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  speech, it's an attack on our most sacred right, a free expression, and that's the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=226.1s)]
*  very right upon which all of our other constitutional rights rest. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=230.9s)]
*  Now, R.F.K. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=236.18s)]
*  Jr. and I, we don't agree on everything. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=238.34s)]
*  We did have him for a town hall. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=240.26s)]
*  We did hear him out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=241.94s)]
*  There are areas where we agree. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=243.38s)]
*  He is absolutely, positively right about the dangers of big media in this country and their [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=245.42s)]
*  censorship. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=251.5s)]
*  They won't even show you Kamala and Tim Walz in their own words. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=252.5s)]
*  The danger of lawfare, the danger of Big Pharma, an abusively biased federal bureaucracy that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=255.7s)]
*  is completely and totally out of control, a weaponized system of justice. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=262.34s)]
*  He's right about the war on our children, and he's been outspoken about the need for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=266.54s)]
*  more border security. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=270.7s)]
*  In many ways, R.F.K. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=272.34s)]
*  Jr. is a victim of this system. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=273.34s)]
*  He was running for president to hold our government accountable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=276.06s)]
*  Well, that's supposed to be the American way, but the Democratic Party, our very own [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=279.38s)]
*  government, they did everything in their power to prevent him from ever reaching the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=284.38s)]
*  finish line. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=288.78s)]
*  And the media, well, they just aided and abetted the whole process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=289.46s)]
*  They took him to court. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=293.3s)]
*  They bled his campaign dry in state after state after state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=294.5s)]
*  He laid this out today, attempting to block him from the ballot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=298.18s)]
*  The party of former president John F. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  Kennedy and his own father, Robert F. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=305.1s)]
*  Kennedy, refused to even allow him to attempt to compete. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=307.54s)]
*  He was just completely shut down. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=311.5s)]
*  Now, you talk about democracy in peril. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  The party that waxes so poetic about democracy, tried to block democracy in real time, in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=316.18s)]
*  action. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=323.3s)]
*  Now, the Biden administration even refused to provide him, as President Trump mentioned, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=324.3s)]
*  with Secret Service protection for months on end. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=328.86s)]
*  This drove me insane, despite what we knew were credible threats against any Kennedy [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=331.3s)]
*  member. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's sad, it's tragic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  Provide them the Secret Service protection. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=339.82s)]
*  Now, this is Robert F. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=341.82000000000005s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=342.94s)]
*  And as President Trump mentioned, both his father and his uncle, as president, his uncle, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=343.94s)]
*  was assassinated. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=350.1s)]
*  And meanwhile, the state-run media mob was hostile towards this campaign from day one. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=351.1s)]
*  They won't vet Kamala Harris. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  They won't vet Tim Walz. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  They won't play them in their own words. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=360.3s)]
*  They would rather keep you ignorant and do everything they can do to create the equivalent [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=362.22s)]
*  of Joe Biden hiding in his basement all throughout the 2020 campaign. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=369.42s)]
*  Now, they tried to destroy and censor R.F.K. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=373.3s)]
*  Jr. on every single turn. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=376.26s)]
*  They should be ashamed of themselves, but journalism's dead. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=378.78s)]
*  Now, even today, almost no major networks took Kennedy's speech. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=381.94s)]
*  Vague News CNN carried the speech for a little while, until Kennedy started sharing the truth [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=386.46s)]
*  about the media. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=391.58s)]
*  Then they said, oh, we've heard enough. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=392.58s)]
*  The big networks, they didn't carry it live. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=394.46s)]
*  MSDNC, they didn't carry one word of his speech. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=397.86s)]
*  Pretty powerful institutions now in the Democratic Party, combined with the deep state and government [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=400.74s)]
*  and media mob, are all putting every single cinder block on the scales of yet another [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=406.62s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  We have chronicled this in 2016 and 2020 for you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=417.38s)]
*  I watched this today with Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=418.38s)]
*  I felt sorry for him and all that they put him through and how they're treating him [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  and how they stacked the deck against him every and any way they could. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  These institutions are, frankly, fundamentally, foundationally corrupt, and these same forces [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  are frankly propping up and protecting Harris' walls every way they possibly can. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=436.8s)]
*  Why won't the media—ask yourself, why won't they show Kamala and Walls in their [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=443.04s)]
*  own words, like we have been doing on this program and a few other programs? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=449.0s)]
*  Why won't they expose her radicalism? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=453.06s)]
*  Why are they allowing her to avoid all press conferences, all interviews, all gaggles, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  for well over a month? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  How long does she need to prepare for a single, you know, softball cupcake interview? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=463.16s)]
*  Robin F. Kennedy Jr. said the Kamala's campaign was nothing but smoke and mirrors, and he's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=468.56s)]
*  right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=473.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=474.16s)]
*  Instead of showing us her substance and character, the DNC and its media organs engineered a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=475.16s)]
*  surge of popularity for Vice President Harris based upon nothing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=482.76s)]
*  No policies, no interviews, no debates, only smoke and mirrors. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=488.56s)]
*  Smoke and mirrors, that is Kamala's campaign in a nutshell, and that was the entire DNC. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=495.88s)]
*  I'm glad to be home in the free state of Florida. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=502.56s)]
*  It was one big lie from beginning to end. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=505.48s)]
*  We have a fake, phony, week-long event, pretty much zero substance. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  Were they talking about inflation, the economy, the danger of their open borders, 11 million [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  unvetted, Harris-Biden illegal immigrants, the rape, the murder, the violent crimes that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=518.48s)]
*  are being committed, the high cost to all of you? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=523.28s)]
*  No, they weren't talking about any of that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=525.44s)]
*  The high cost of the energy pot? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=527.4s)]
*  No, they weren't talking about that either. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=528.96s)]
*  And never ending, the party of joy and freedom, as they say, you know, it was really the joy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=531.44s)]
*  of hate, the joy of hating Donald Trump, if you call that joy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=537.56s)]
*  You know, on night one, Democrats waved, well, we love Joe Banner, all over the place. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=542.0s)]
*  You watch Nancy, she was clinging to her, we love Joe, we love Joe, and all she did [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=547.04s)]
*  was stab Joe in the back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=551.98s)]
*  And Biden delivered his farewell address. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  Week after, people like Pelosi and Schumer and Obama and Hollywood elites like George [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=556.6s)]
*  Clooney, the idiot that he is, forced him to end his campaign. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  They didn't love Joe, they kicked him to the curb, and yet here they are pretending [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=566.36s)]
*  they love Joe. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  If they loved Joe, they wouldn't have treated him that way. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  On night two, you had socialist Bernie Sanders, which, frankly, on night one, it was AOC, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=574.6s)]
*  night two, it was Bernie. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=579.6s)]
*  I mean, that is now the heart and soul. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=580.6s)]
*  That is the new radicalized Democratic, you know, frankly, radical Marxist socialist communist [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=583.0s)]
*  party that they are. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=589.7600000000001s)]
*  And he was trashing capitalism and billionaires. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=591.32s)]
*  The speech was immediately followed by the billionaire governor of Illinois. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=593.88s)]
*  Can't make that up. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=597.76s)]
*  And on night three, we heard from Kamala's running mate, Tim Walz, who claims to be a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=599.26s)]
*  middle of the road, moderate from the Midwest. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  He's anything but it, in his case. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=606.48s)]
*  OK, let's see, legal drivers licenses for illegal immigrants. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=609.48s)]
*  Oh, and they get free college in Minnesota. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  How nice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=616.36s)]
*  Oh, and let's put feminine hygiene products in boys' bathrooms and schools. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=617.36s)]
*  Great idea. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=621.34s)]
*  Let's have, quote, gender-affirming care. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=622.34s)]
*  And we don't need to tell mom and dad, you know, why do we need parents? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=625.14s)]
*  Walz is a far-left radical, extreme, frankly dangerous leftist obsessed with communist [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=629.38s)]
*  China. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=635.34s)]
*  He's lied about everything from his service in the National Guard. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=636.34s)]
*  He claimed he fought in a war zone he never did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=639.46s)]
*  He lied about his rank. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=642.44s)]
*  He lied about being a head football coach. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  He lied about his drunk driving arrest in the 90s. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=646.0600000000001s)]
*  He even lied about using IVF to conceive children. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=648.9s)]
*  Walz was most famous for letting Minneapolis burn for days on end during the mostly peaceful, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=652.74s)]
*  as they said, not true, 2020 riots. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=659.5799999999999s)]
*  And that was before he finally was forced to send in the National Guard. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=662.98s)]
*  After a proper DEI vetting, his family opened up the windows to their family home. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=666.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=671.98s)]
*  Because as the rioting was going on and businesses destroyed and people were dying, they wanted [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=672.98s)]
*  to take in the smell of burning tires. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=677.5s)]
*  Maybe they liked the smell of a roadkill skunk, too. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=680.14s)]
*  And they wanted to bask in the historic moment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=683.62s)]
*  Kamala encouraged and supported the rioters and insurrectionists and helped bail them [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=686.38s)]
*  all out of jail. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=691.3s)]
*  Where's Liz Cheney when you need her? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=692.3s)]
*  Democrats, they want you to believe they are moderate public servants, anything but. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=694.5s)]
*  And then on night four, the grand finale last night, it was Kamala's big night to shine. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=700.2199999999999s)]
*  Plus, there were reports about a big name that was going to, you know, take to the stage [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=704.82s)]
*  big. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=709.7s)]
*  And in fact, two separate Democrats, they told me personally, Beyoncé was in the house. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=710.7s)]
*  She was in the building. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=716.5s)]
*  I have no doubt, by the way, that they were told that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=717.5s)]
*  I also have no doubt the top Democrats told the same thing to TMZ. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=721.62s)]
*  I know the people at TMZ. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=725.3s)]
*  I know Harvey Levin. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=726.3s)]
*  He is a straight arrow when it comes to reporting. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=727.94s)]
*  And there was some source—he probably is not going to reveal it—that told him with [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=731.22s)]
*  certainty it was happening. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=735.22s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=736.98s)]
*  He was lied to. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=737.98s)]
*  The Democrats I talked to, they were all lied to, too. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=738.98s)]
*  There was no surprise guest, more smoke and mirrors, more deception, probably to boost [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=741.7s)]
*  viewership. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=746.6600000000001s)]
*  But this was the entire week, a dishonest, deceptive charade designed to fool all of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=748.74s)]
*  you, not win your support. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=754.94s)]
*  You didn't hear about better policies for you and your family and your future. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=757.82s)]
*  Nonstop nightmares about the less very scary, you know, boogeyman project 2025. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=761.82s)]
*  I don't have any clue what's in 2025. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=768.3000000000001s)]
*  Trump has absolutely and had nothing to do with it, wants nothing to do with it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=771.2600000000001s)]
*  He said it over and over again. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=775.6s)]
*  And they lied about his position on abortion, on the economy, on immigration. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=777.46s)]
*  They just flat-out lied all night after night after night. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=781.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, we got nonstop fearmongering about Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=785.3s)]
*  And can you believe it? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=790.2199999999999s)]
*  Kamala is just as upset as all of us and all of you about the high prices of bread and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=791.54s)]
*  eggs and the open border problem. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=801.26s)]
*  Now, she told us inflation was transitory and that Bidenomics is something we're very [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=804.9s)]
*  proud of and that the border is secure. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=810.18s)]
*  She didn't visit it, but she never visited Europe either. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=812.82s)]
*  She promised if elected, she would hold the current administration accountable and immediately [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=815.72s)]
*  fix all of these serious problems. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=820.5s)]
*  This is insanity, because she owns these problems. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  She caused these problems. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=826.96s)]
*  She's the last person in the room, right, and now wants to pretend like she had nothing [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=828.46s)]
*  to do with any of it? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=832.48s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=834.2600000000001s)]
*  First, you deny it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=835.2600000000001s)]
*  Then you blame Joe. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  And then you say you're going to fix it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=838.3800000000001s)]
*  And I say, why aren't you fixing it now? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=839.98s)]
*  Why didn't you fix it in the last three and a half years? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=841.66s)]
*  And what are all these magical policies that she's been keeping secret for the last four [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=844.3s)]
*  years that are a direct contradiction of everything she said in 2019 and 2020? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=849.1s)]
*  You know, what's the magic pill that's going to solve your problems? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=854.5s)]
*  Now, of course, she didn't say last night. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=857.54s)]
*  She's never going to say, because she can't say. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=859.82s)]
*  She can't list a single policy position on her website or sit down for an interview or [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=862.46s)]
*  or go anywhere near anything without a teleprompter. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=868.38s)]
*  And today she answered just one question, a reporter shouted, what's next? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=871.7s)]
*  And she answered, quote, we're going to walk up those stairs. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=877.18s)]
*  That's next. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=882.06s)]
*  I'm pointing to the steps to Air Force Two. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=883.06s)]
*  This is not a campaign. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=885.66s)]
*  It is a con. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=886.96s)]
*  It is a coordinated effort by very powerful institutions, the one that Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=888.14s)]
*  described in detail today to hide what is the most radical, extreme, unlikable candidate [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=893.78s)]
*  in American history with the most dangerous policies possible. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfEh_aZhzTU&t=900.66s)]
