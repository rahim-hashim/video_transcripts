# Newt Gingrich: This is destroying American identity
**Fox News:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc)
*  and former Speaker of the House, the one and only Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=0.0s)]
*  Newt, I want to take that political question to you as well. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=3.56s)]
*  If you're Joe Biden and you're constantly at odds with Senator Joe Biden, who once said [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=7.12s)]
*  sanctuary cities shouldn't be able to do what they do, employers should be punished [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=12.16s)]
*  for hiring, quote, illegals, he said he wanted to make sure that drugs pouring in from, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=16.06s)]
*  corrupt Mexico couldn't get here—I mean, President Biden is constantly at odds with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=22.76s)]
*  Senator Biden. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=27.86s)]
*  Senator Biden had a point. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=28.86s)]
*  I think he was more center-right in his views on immigration and border security. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=29.98s)]
*  But as the problem has increased in severity, Joe Biden's engagement on it has decreased. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=34.58s)]
*  And I'm asking you first, as somebody who's known and worked with Joe Biden for years, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=41.58s)]
*  what you make of all that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=44.66s)]
*  One. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=45.94s)]
*  Two, what about the political currency that he's frittering away? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=46.94s)]
*  The polls show that immigration, along with inflation, are his worst handled issues. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=50.54s)]
*  Well, look, I think you can't understand Joe Biden without looking at his eight years [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=56.34s)]
*  as Barack Obama's vice president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=64.18s)]
*  Obama is arguably the most radical person ever to be president, protected by the news [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=67.26s)]
*  media. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=73.54s)]
*  When you look at his underlying values and his speeches and his policies and the people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=74.54s)]
*  he brought in, he is extraordinarily radical. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=79.5s)]
*  In that process, Biden, over an eight-year period, became sort of a mini-Barack, if you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=83.34s)]
*  will. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=89.78s)]
*  And so what you have—we don't have a problem on the border. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=90.78s)]
*  We have a Biden immigration policy, which is working perfectly if you're a hard-left [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=93.98s)]
*  person. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  It is destroying American identity. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  It's crippling the rule of law. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  It is flooding the country with people who haven't been trained into the culture, don't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  necessarily understand how to function in our society and create all sorts of problems. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=113.06s)]
*  And I think we don't realize yet this is a deliberate policy by people who want to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=118.86s)]
*  undermine America, change it profoundly and eliminate all of those crazy ideas like the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=125.14s)]
*  Constitution, the rule of law, the work ethic, meritocracy, actually being able to know and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=132.7s)]
*  do something. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=139.66s)]
*  If you're on the hard left, those are all terrible ideas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=141.1s)]
*  And so what you have with Biden is a commitment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=144.58s)]
*  Now, I think politically, probably, it's going to be a disaster. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=147.66s)]
*  But they don't see it that way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=152.46s)]
*  They won the presidency in 2020. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=153.62s)]
*  They survived 2022. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=156.7s)]
*  They had an OK 2023. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=158.94s)]
*  I think they think that they have a reasonable chance of survival. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=161.22s)]
*  They know that if they were to go to the policies you and I believe in, that their entire left [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=165.86s)]
*  would erupt and there'd be a civil war in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=171.82s)]
*  So Biden goes along with the most active, aggressive and militant parts of his coalition. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=175.74s)]
*  And what we have is what you showed tonight on television. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=182.5s)]
*  Now, I don't know if it's a full on civil war in the Democratic Party, but you do see [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=184.86s)]
*  some people pulling away from Biden on this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  You have the Democratic governor of Arizona all of a sudden finding religion on border [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=192.9s)]
*  security, John Fetterman, the senator from Pennsylvania, and a few others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=197.34s)]
*  And I think they're reading the polls and the tea leaves. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=201.9s)]
*  They're seeing that the growing number of Democrats, and certainly the vast majority [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=204.14s)]
*  of independents, now put border security top of the list. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=207.62s)]
*  And so I think people look at it as national security sovereignty as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=211.98s)]
*  But as Stephen Miller was stating, there are things an ex-administration can do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  When you were speaker, thinking back to your time as speaker of the House and as a congressional [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=222.0s)]
*  expert, what can the Congress do to support the next president of the United States so [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=225.4s)]
*  that everything's not through executive action? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=229.96s)]
*  What should Congress do? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me start with right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't have to wait for the next president. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=238.0s)]
*  I think that Speaker Mike Johnson has done a very good job of setting it up to say, look, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=239.0s)]
*  you want aid for Ukraine, you want aid for Israel, fine, we're going to fix the border. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  Here is a Republican bill that passed that would dramatically change the border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=251.12s)]
*  And what you've seen so far is the Biden administration and the Senate Democrats have said, no, no, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=255.52s)]
*  keeping the border open, having a few million more illegal immigrants is more important [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=261.36s)]
*  to us than getting aid to Israel or aid to Ukraine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=266.02000000000004s)]
*  And I hope that the House Republicans will stick very firmly in favor of a policy, which, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  by the way, at America's New Majority Project, we just did a poll, and 75 percent of the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=276.56s)]
*  country favors more border guards. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=282.56s)]
*  Something like 67 percent of the country favors the bill that the Republicans passed in the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=287.32s)]
*  House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=292.92s)]
*  There is zero opportunity to ever get a majority in favor of Biden's illegal immigration [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=293.92s)]
*  policy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=299.36s)]
*  Now, if House Republicans will stand firm, you might be shocked by January, February, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=300.48s)]
*  March to suddenly see the president have to actually sign a bill that gets us back to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  a Trump policy, which we know worked. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=311.92s)]
*  I mean, this is a matter of practical fact. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  The Trump policy on the border worked. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=317.44s)]
*  We are a safer country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=321.04s)]
*  We had less illegal immigration. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=322.72s)]
*  We had a much greater opportunity to grow and be safe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  We stopped a lot of drugs, a lot of human trafficking, and a lot of cartel activity. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=328.58s)]
*  We can get back to that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  And the House Republicans, under Speaker Johnson, have taken a very important first step in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=335.46s)]
*  that direction. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=340.14s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your wisdom and your strategic counsel. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=341.14s)]
*  Merry Christmas to Kalistan and you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=345.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBowbG-_cMc&t=358.58s)]
