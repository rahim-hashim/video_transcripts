# Marco Rubio: This is how state-run media is used by authoritarian governments
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c)
*  Here with reaction, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, great to have you back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=3.16s)]
*  You know, you're pointing out something that is deep and profound, and I think this poll [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=4.64s)]
*  echoes what you're saying here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=9.96s)]
*  The fact that they can't even allow—the largest margin of victory in an Iowa caucus [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=11.8s)]
*  was 12.8 percent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=18.28s)]
*  That was Bob Dole in 1988. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=20.36s)]
*  Here, Donald Trump wins by a whopping 30 points, and they can't even carry his speech. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=23.68s)]
*  I don't even know what to say to that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=31.08s)]
*  What, their audience is going to melt if they hear him? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=33.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's not about bias anymore. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=36.8s)]
*  There's always been liberal bias in the media. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=38.72s)]
*  Human beings are biased. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  They're partisan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  And they're not just partisan, like openly partisan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  They are now extending that to not just attack Trump as a candidate, as a former president [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  and future president, but also to attack the people who follow him just in the last 48 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=49.96s)]
*  hours. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=54.72s)]
*  We've had multiple people go on the air on other networks and talk about things like, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=55.72s)]
*  well, in Iowa, the problem is these are all white Christians. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=59.28s)]
*  Or their attitude about the followers of Trump is these are dumb, stupid, uneducated people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=62.36s)]
*  that don't know any better or worse. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  They're haters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=68.6s)]
*  They're bigots. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=69.6s)]
*  And so what's really changed is not just the partisan tone of the coverage, but now [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=71.08s)]
*  this effort to say, we're not going to carry his speech, we're not going to let you hear [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  what he has to say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=79.64s)]
*  We'll interpret it and we'll put out the snippets we want you to hear. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=80.64s)]
*  But we've made the decision to no longer carry it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=83.64s)]
*  You know, you put up my message a moment ago from when I put up an X. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=85.76s)]
*  This is exactly how state-run media is used by authoritarian governments to delegitimize, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=89.0s)]
*  to discredit, to basically make people believe that there is no alternative but to the regime [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  and to their rule. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  And that's how that's it's destroying the media in this country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  No, it's why at this point, you know, no one believes anything they see or hear anymore. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=102.68s)]
*  You know, I declared media was dead in 2007. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=107.6s)]
*  Boy, I had no idea how right I was. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=110.56s)]
*  You know, you talked about, for example, the work, the things that you accomplished and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=112.72s)]
*  achieved when Donald Trump was in the White House, expanding child tax credits, tough [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=117.84s)]
*  sanctions on regimes in Cuba, Venezuela. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=122.76s)]
*  You know, now we have people showing up at our border, unvetted by Joe Biden, allowed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=126.8s)]
*  into this country, you know, hundreds from Iran, hundreds from Syria, thousands from [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=133.0s)]
*  Egypt, thousands from Afghanistan, 12,000 from Russia, 26,000 from China. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=137.8s)]
*  These are our top geopolitical foes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=144.0s)]
*  These are countries that have ties to terrorist groups. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=146.52s)]
*  They get into this country unvetted. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=149.36s)]
*  You know, what are the odds, you know, terror cells have been invited in, unvetted by Joe [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=151.4s)]
*  Biden? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=156.12s)]
*  I'd say they're pretty high. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=157.12s)]
*  Yeah, when you have six, seven, eight million people coming into a country all of a sudden [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  within a two-year period, a three-year period, these are not—there's going to be some [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=163.76s)]
*  percentage of them that are going to come here and commit crimes or worse, acts of terrorism [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  and the like. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, we're in a mess, OK? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  We now have two active wars going on in the world, both of which threaten to suck us in, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=173.2s)]
*  and a potential third one in the Asia-Pacific region with Taiwan and China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=177.32s)]
*  We have a country where a growing number of Americans will tell you, a majority of Americans [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=181.16s)]
*  now say their standard of living is worse than their parents, and they no longer believe [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=184.88s)]
*  America is a country where everyone has a chance to get ahead. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  We have all of our major institutions, universities, our schools, the media, the healthcare experts, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=192.32s)]
*  all of it's broken, all of it's lost its credibility, all because of their own actions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=197.64s)]
*  It's going to take some big actions, controversial actions, uncomfortable actions, to get this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=201.76s)]
*  thing right, and that starts at the border. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=206.32s)]
*  It's not going to be easy to fix this border thing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=208.2s)]
*  We're going to have to do something about the fact that we have five, six, seven, eight [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  million people that have come in here over the last three years under Joe Biden. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=212.64s)]
*  There's going to have to be deportations at a level we've never seen before. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=216.28s)]
*  That's not anything we've ever done before, but we're going to have to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  All this is going to be hard. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=222.8s)]
*  And the one thing I know about Donald Trump is he's not going to let some special interests [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  come in and stop it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=227.88s)]
*  He's not going to let bureaucrats stand in the way, and he's not going to care how much [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=228.88s)]
*  he's smeared in the mainstream media over it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=232.08s)]
*  He's going to get it done. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  I saw him do it, and we need that again. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  We're going to have to make some tough, uncomfortable choices, and Donald Trump is the person I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=237.28s)]
*  know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  He gets elected. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  He'll do these things. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, you say that, and you were once an opponent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=244.84s)]
*  He's a fierce opponent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=247.76s)]
*  I saw a side of him, and I've been seeing a side of him, and he's, you know, that maybe [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=249.96s)]
*  we haven't seen before. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=255.7s)]
*  I thought he was very gracious in his speech in Iowa the other night towards his opponents. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=256.7s)]
*  That's been a criticism of his. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=263.68s)]
*  Now, in his defense, you know, there's never been a guy persecuted more than this guy, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=265.28s)]
*  starting from the day that he came down the escalator with Melania, you know, immediately [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  being, you know, called a racist, etc., moving on to, can you imagine Donald Trump with the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=274.88s)]
*  nuclear codes? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=281.2s)]
*  It seems like the media is living back circa 2016, thinking that if they say democracy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  in parallel, not talk about January 6th ad nauseam, you know, say Trump is evil, that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  that will win them the election. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  If Joe Biden can't point to a single policy success, doesn't that lose him the election? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=300.06s)]
*  And do you even think Biden makes it to November? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=306.0s)]
*  Well, I think he intends to make it to November. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=308.62s)]
*  He's going to be the nominee of the Democrats, unless something dramatic happens here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=311.8s)]
*  But I'll say this, he has nothing to point to. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=315.62s)]
*  What's he going to argue? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=317.46s)]
*  That the economy is better off? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=318.46s)]
*  That America is safer? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=319.74s)]
*  That America's reputation is stronger in the world? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=320.86s)]
*  That the border is secured? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=323.18s)]
*  The only thing that they have to focus on is they talk about January 6th nonstop and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=324.5s)]
*  that Trump somehow is going to become some sort of a dictator if he's elected. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  That's the only thing they have to run on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=332.94s)]
*  People aren't buying this stuff. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  You know, Trump was president once and there weren't jail filled with political prisoners. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  There weren't mass executions or any of these ridiculous things that they talk about. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=340.14s)]
*  At the end of the day, this is about the future of our country and it isn't a mess and we [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=344.05999999999995s)]
*  have to fix it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=347.97999999999996s)]
*  And if we don't fix it, if we don't win this election, which is what I think you saw President [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump's message the other night is, look, there's still some elections people can stay [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=352.14s)]
*  in. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=355.78s)]
*  I'm not here to tell anybody to drop out. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=356.78s)]
*  What I'm saying is he's going to be the nominee of the Republican Party. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=357.78s)]
*  He gives us the best chance to win and he better win because he is the one that will [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=361.02s)]
*  fix this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuToz0Qrx1c&t=364.5s)]
