# Joe Concha: 'Journalism has morphed into activism'
**Fox News:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY)
*  for Arkansas, Governor Mike Huckabee, Fox News contributor Joe Concha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, let me start with you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=4.44s)]
*  On the issues of the day—and I'm looking at the polls, but I don't really want to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=6.22s)]
*  put a lot of stock, 236 days out of this election, in polling today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=10.08s)]
*  Laura Trump was very clear that major changes are coming to the Republican Party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=16.72s)]
*  That would include legal ballot harvesting, encouraging conservatives, Republicans, to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=22.14s)]
*  vote early, vote by mail, so they're not down hundreds of thousands of votes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=27.0s)]
*  But more importantly, I think the message about law and order and safety and security [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=31.64s)]
*  and secure borders and energy independence and America's leadership role in the world [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=35.96s)]
*  stage are very important also. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=41.64s)]
*  Well, they're very important. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Look at the big shift that has happened among non-white voters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=46.2s)]
*  This poll that you mentioned shows that in 2020, Joe Biden had a 50-point advantage, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=49.08s)]
*  50 points. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=54.92s)]
*  It's now down to 12. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=56.4s)]
*  Sean, that's the kind of thing that is cataclysmic in political terms. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  It's just a stunning reversal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=63.04s)]
*  Now, part of the reason for that is that a lot of people don't understand that some [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=65.72s)]
*  of the hardest-working people in this country are Hispanics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's not just that they're hard-working and they're seeing their paychecks dry up [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  because of inflation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=77.44s)]
*  And it means that every working family in this country, according to recent numbers, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=79.28s)]
*  have $11,434 less than they did when Donald Trump was president because of inflation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=84.96s)]
*  So that's one hit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  The second is they're working hard and they see people who didn't come across the border [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=93.72s)]
*  legally. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=98.28s)]
*  They came illegally. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=99.28s)]
*  They're committing crime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  They're making it difficult for people to respect them as legal immigrants. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=101.6s)]
*  And worst of all, they're watching these people get hotel rooms, three meals a day, $10,000 [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  gift cards and flying all over the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=112.0s)]
*  People are sick of it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=114.76s)]
*  And what you said, it's common sense. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=116.36s)]
*  And there's a whole lot more of common sense in this country than the Democrats think there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=118.76s)]
*  is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=122.36s)]
*  Joe, Joe Contra, you follow the media as closely as anybody. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=123.36s)]
*  And it just—no matter what the issue, what the day, the subject always returns to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=127.68s)]
*  fact that they hate Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=133.84s)]
*  They want to believe everything awful about Donald Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=135.76s)]
*  There's zero objectivity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, as I said about fake Jake over fake news CNN, he claims that he's a journalist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=141.12s)]
*  He's full of it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=146.6s)]
*  He's not a journalist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=147.6s)]
*  He's a liberal talk show host that pretends to be a journalist. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=148.6s)]
*  That would be the same at all these people that think they're journalists on MSNBC, DNC, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=152.6s)]
*  or CNN, or ABC, NBC, CBS. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=157.52s)]
*  Are they really objective journalists? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=161.32s)]
*  Do they even exist except for our news division? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Activism has morphed into activism at this point, Sean. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=169.12s)]
*  And it would be better if just the Jake Tappers of the world and the Rachel Maddowes and the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Jen Psaki of the world just owned it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=177.76s)]
*  Said, yes, we are rooting for the Democratic Party, for Joe Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=179.68s)]
*  We want him to win. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=183.88s)]
*  We want Trump to lose. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=185.24s)]
*  We want to demagogue Republicans who—they put together the Lake and Riley Act, and somehow [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=186.76s)]
*  you have Joy Reid on MSNBC talking about how that's a bad thing if we start deporting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=193.0s)]
*  or arresting people and keeping them behind bars when they commit crimes, whether they're [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  violent crimes, whether they're other kinds of crimes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=202.72s)]
*  And all I know is now, when you look at the polling, if we go back to that for a second, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=205.48s)]
*  I'm vexed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=209.16s)]
*  I mean, terribly vexed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=210.16s)]
*  I mean, I was told by the Pom Pom Brigade that we just talked about on other networks [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=211.16s)]
*  and in op-eds and the Washington Times, New York Post, that last week's State of the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Union address, that was supposed to reset the whole ballgame, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Was the beginning of the end for Trump that Biden was feisty and he showed energy and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=221.04s)]
*  had the passion of a sophomore on, you know, pixie sticks and jello shots on spring break. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  And now we're seeing Trump rising in the polls. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  And since the State of the Union, well, Biden has fallen back even further. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  So that tells you that, you know, old guy yelling and reading a teleprompter for an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  hour and doing a divisive speech by all polling shows that this was more divisive than a unity [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  speech. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=246.44s)]
*  It doesn't resonate well with voters. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=247.44s)]
*  And it bears repeating again in seven swing states, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=252.96s)]
*  Joe Biden trails in all seven. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Ohio and Florida, they're gone as far as being bellwether states. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=256.76s)]
*  They are solid red. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=259.8s)]
*  And Joe Biden isn't, you know, a bordeaux. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=261.08s)]
*  He's not going to get better with age as we get closer to the election, which is 230 [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=263.44s)]
*  something days away. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=267.2s)]
*  And one has to believe that any time he's outside of a teleprompter, outside anything [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=268.38s)]
*  that's remarks that are written for him, it's going to be clean up on aisle one, 14, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=272.56s)]
*  19 and 27, as we've seen in the days since that State of the Union. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=277.2s)]
*  I don't see how Democrats solve this at this point, because there aren't going to be any [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=281.6s)]
*  more State of the Unions to at least try to prop them up outside of the convention. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=284.88s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, Laura Trump was on the show last night talking about the president [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=288.6s)]
*  trying to campaign in, of all places, New York state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, I would like to see, anyone, nobody ever listens to me, governor, so I just, I just [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  throw out my ideas that get kind of, they evaporate in thin air. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  I would like to see President Trump go in the state of New Jersey. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=308.68s)]
*  I'd like to see him go into predominantly African American, Hispanic American communities. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd like to, I'd like for him to remind people that under his leadership, that he [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  set record low unemployment in the African American community, the Hispanic American [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=325.0s)]
*  community, the Asian community, women, African American youth, all of these things that he [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=330.0s)]
*  has done and accomplished, and then ask, how's the Democratic Party's policies? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=336.6s)]
*  How's law and order in your town or city? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=340.88s)]
*  How are your schools for your kids doing? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=343.48s)]
*  I think that that might be an effective idea for him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=345.52s)]
*  Sean, I just want to say, gee, I listen to you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=349.68s)]
*  I don't care what Joe does, I listen to you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=354.0s)]
*  But I do think you're right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=357.64s)]
*  I think President Trump should go. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=359.16s)]
*  Call Donald Trump, Mar-a-Lago, ask him to listen. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=360.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=362.88s)]
*  No, I think it's a great idea. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=363.88s)]
*  I think he should go. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=365.72s)]
*  He ought to be the Captain Kirk of the 2024 race, that he goes where no man has gone before, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=367.32000000000005s)]
*  that he goes to these places where people are hurting, their jobs are not paying them [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  enough to keep up with inflation, where the working class people are taking it on the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=378.36s)]
*  chin. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=382.92s)]
*  And the very people that sat and listened to Joe Biden's speech, quite frankly, when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=383.92s)]
*  I was listening to that, having him yell at me so angrily for an hour, I was ready for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  someone to give me a phone call and try to sell me extended car warranties. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=394.04s)]
*  I thought it would be more pleasant than listening to another minute of Joe Biden's divisive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=398.56s)]
*  speech. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=403.88s)]
*  I think he's got a great opportunity. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=404.88s)]
*  I hope he listens to you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=406.68s)]
*  You know, I'm beginning to see the Democratic Party's emerge as the party of the coastal [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=408.8s)]
*  and media elite class. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH77nLKwQZY&t=413.88s)]
