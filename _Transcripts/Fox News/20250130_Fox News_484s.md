# JD Vance: Energy can unleash incredible economic growth
**Fox News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY)
*  And here's more, part two of my exclusive interview with the Vice President, JD Vance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the economy. This report that I saw that the average American cannot afford a thousand dollar unexpected expense. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=5.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=17.92s)]
*  I'm like, wow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=18.42s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=19.6s)]
*  I mean, prices have gone up so dramatically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=20.1s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=23.8s)]
*  And then I watch you with Margaret Brennan and she's like, you've been in office five days. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=24.3s)]
*  You said it was going to be fixed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=29.2s)]
*  It's still the Harris Biden economy that we're working under and it's going to take time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=31.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=35.1s)]
*  Okay. So how do we get there quickly so that the American people can enjoy that prosperity you spoke of earlier? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=35.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot there. And of course, you know, Sean, I was one of those families for the most biggest part of my childhood that cannot afford it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=43.2s)]
*  I live paycheck to paycheck. It sucks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=50.6s)]
*  And it does suck. And it's stressful and it causes anxiety. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=51.8s)]
*  And of course, when that disaster strikes, it can really be disastrous for a family that's living on the margins. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=57.0s)]
*  And I think fundamentally, President Trump was elected to ensure that those people have better lives. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=62.0s)]
*  And here's what we have to do. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=66.7s)]
*  And there are three big prongs, I think, to Donald Trump's economic program. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=68.6s)]
*  Number one is we have an incredible resource that no country in the world can match. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=72.5s)]
*  We have access to energy. Energy goes into our manufactured goods. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=78.3s)]
*  Energy goes into our transportation that gets things from one place to the grocery store or to Home Depot or wherever it is that people are buying the things that they need. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=81.7s)]
*  We have to unleash the American energy economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=90.9s)]
*  And if we do that, yes, we're going to create good energy jobs at high wages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  We're also going to lower costs for American consumers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=97.7s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=99.9s)]
*  I love the fact that we can also bankrupt Iran and Russia at the same time we could sell all our energy to Western Europe, which is good for national security. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=109.7s)]
*  Okay. I'm a big believer in Doge. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=110.6s)]
*  The idea would be transformational. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=112.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=115.0s)]
*  Cut two trillion dollars. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  We always talk about cutting waste, fraud and abuse and limited government, greater freedom. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't want them to be words. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  I want that to be reality. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  And we talk about it, but I see a lot of areas that we're going to have to spend. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=124.8s)]
*  Sure up Social Security and Medicare. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=128.6s)]
*  That's going to cost a lot of money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Deporting people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=132.1s)]
*  That's going to cost money, but a lot cheaper than housing them, health care and education. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=133.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=137.2s)]
*  But we also in defense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=138.2s)]
*  This scares me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=140.1s)]
*  China, Russia of hypersonics. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=141.4s)]
*  We saw the story about AI. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=143.5s)]
*  Maybe China. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  We didn't know that perhaps they have surpassed us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=147.2s)]
*  That concerns me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=150.7s)]
*  The next generation of warfare. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=152.5s)]
*  The president kind of pushed back on me when I asked him about it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=155.7s)]
*  I believe future wars are not going to be on a battlefield. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=158.7s)]
*  And I know you serve your country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=162.0s)]
*  I think future wars are going to be fought in air-conditioned offices and people pushing buttons. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=164.1s)]
*  Maybe not as quick. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=169.1s)]
*  And then he wants an Iron Dome that he wants to start immediately. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=170.5s)]
*  All of that will cost money. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=173.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=175.2s)]
*  And then we got 40 trillion in debt. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=175.5s)]
*  Will energy make up that money? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=178.1s)]
*  I think you make up a lot, Sean, because again energy can lower the cost of things. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=180.4s)]
*  It can also unleash incredible economic growth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=184.1s)]
*  And you know what really worries me about our debt picture is the economic growth, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=186.3s)]
*  40 trillion dollars in debt, that's a very big number. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=193.0s)]
*  If we're growing this economy at 4% a year, it's a much, much more solvable problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=195.8s)]
*  How long will it take to get there? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=201.8s)]
*  4% would be a huge jump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=203.1s)]
*  I don't know how long it takes, Sean, but I do think that with smarter economic policies, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=204.6s)]
*  we can get back to 4% economic growth as opposed to 1% economic growth, which is what we've had under Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=208.0s)]
*  Of course, during the last Trump administration, we had for most of his administration, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  we had north of 3% economic growth, which is why it was such a positive economic time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=217.1s)]
*  When you talk about defense, I really do believe that we just, we need to spend obviously more on defense to make our country safer. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=223.1s)]
*  We also have to spend smarter on defense. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=231.1s)]
*  Our procurement process is totally broken. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=233.6s)]
*  The way that we actually buy weapons has become totally broken. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=236.0s)]
*  That we've made it harder for new entrants, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=240.0s)]
*  New companies to develop new technologies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=242.5s)]
*  We've learned this in Russia, Ukraine. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=245.5s)]
*  We've learned this elsewhere. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=247.3s)]
*  The face of the modern battlefield has changed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=248.9s)]
*  It's going to keep on changing, and America has to keep pace with that change. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=251.9s)]
*  And I think what DOJ is going to do, it's going to save money. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=255.6s)]
*  And I really believe it's already identified a lot of cost savings. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=258.6s)]
*  And again, we're eight days into this thing, Sean. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=261.8s)]
*  It's going to identify a lot more cost savings. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=264.5s)]
*  The most important thing that it's going to do, I don't even think it's the cost savings. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=266.9s)]
*  It's making the bureaucracy responsive to the elected president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=270.6s)]
*  In eight days, Sean, we could sit here for an hour, and I could tell you stories I've heard from... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=275.2s)]
*  You're welcome to stay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=279.5s)]
*  I know you have to go. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=281.0s)]
*  I know you got everything. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=282.4s)]
*  I would love to hang out for an hour. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=284.0s)]
*  But look, we've got, if you look at, okay, the president issues an executive order saying, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=286.3s)]
*  we're not going to give grants to organizations that do X, Y, and Z. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=292.3s)]
*  And the bureaucracy just doesn't respond. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  DOJ has identified grants that were going to be made in violation of an executive order [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=299.0s)]
*  and stop them right before the money was wired. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=304.3s)]
*  We're talking about making the people's government responsive to the people's elected president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=307.1s)]
*  That is going to do more to unleash innovation, to unleash economic prosperity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=312.0s)]
*  When you don't have this crushing bureaucracy that answers to nobody sitting on top of the American people, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=317.1s)]
*  we're going to get it off, and we're going to actually make it responsive to our economic growth needs, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  to our needs to buy the right weapons for the next generation of warfare. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=328.6s)]
*  And I think that is the most profound thing that DOJ is going to do. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=332.2s)]
*  Look at the Democrats as the president now is trying to get his cabinet nominees through. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=335.3s)]
*  It seems like they've gone from the denial stage into the rage stage. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  And this week we have three nominees that are going up to the Senate. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=345.9s)]
*  And RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Cash Patel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=352.2s)]
*  I think three excellent choices by the president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=356.9s)]
*  But I have every expectation that the Democrats are going to be vicious. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=360.1s)]
*  Now, we have small majorities in the House, small majority in the Senate. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=364.8s)]
*  How do you get these guys, do you believe they'll get across the finish line? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=368.8s)]
*  How do you help get them across the finish line? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=372.0s)]
*  So I do believe they're going to get across the finish line, Sean, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=373.6s)]
*  but we're going to have to fight for each one and we have to make sure that Republicans, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=375.8s)]
*  I think, were different from Democrats. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=379.8s)]
*  And in some ways I admire that Senate Republicans are a little bit more free thinking, a little bit more independent. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=381.8s)]
*  On the other hand, the president has made his selections [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=388.4s)]
*  and the advice and consent power of the United States Senate should not be used to block people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  because you have one policy disagreement on one issue. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=397.2s)]
*  You don't get to make these decisions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=400.5s)]
*  President Trump gets to make these decisions and he already has. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=402.5s)]
*  Now, there's an important coalition dynamic to this that I'd encourage my fellow Republicans to think about this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=405.9s)]
*  Would we have won the election, at least with the margins that we did, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=411.4s)]
*  unless you had the Tulsi Gabbard component kind of coming to our side, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=415.3s)]
*  unless you had the Joe Rogan types coming to our side? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=419.6s)]
*  Donald Trump won an imposing mandate because he got a different group of people to vote Republican than had ever voted Republican. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  We have to give those parts of the coalition some wins too. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=430.8s)]
*  So yes, we've got a lot of traditional Republicans in the administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=433.8s)]
*  We've got a lot of traditional national security hawks in the administration, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=437.2s)]
*  but we've also got some new people, some people who bring a fresh perspective. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think what makes President Trump's leadership so effective is he's willing to listen to Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=444.1s)]
*  but also he's willing to listen to Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=450.4s)]
*  They're all part of the family now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=453.3s)]
*  We can't say you're not going to get confirmed because we disagree with you on one issue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=455.4s)]
*  The president makes these decisions and he already has. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=460.5s)]
*  But in fairness to RFK and Tulsi, they ran for president. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=463.8s)]
*  They didn't win. Exactly. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=467.6s)]
*  So they will be implementing his policies. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=468.7s)]
*  That's exactly right, Sean. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt5sbRxofY&t=470.5s)]
