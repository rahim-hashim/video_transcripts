# RFK Jr.: We are poisoning ourselves
**Fox News:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg)
*  All right, so the movement to make America healthy again is underway, led by Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=0.0s)]
*  of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., earlier over the weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=6.2s)]
*  Well, today he met with leaders of America's largest food companies, which might have been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=11.44s)]
*  a little bit awkward considering Secretary Kennedy is encouraging them, has been outspoken [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=16.0s)]
*  in terms of highly processed foods and ingredients that are allowed in them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=21.52s)]
*  Some companies are already taking steps on their own to move towards healthier options. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=26.36s)]
*  Now, if you haven't been to Steak and Shake, you gotta go. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  I had two double burgers, and they were phenomenal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=35.16s)]
*  Their fries were phenomenal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=38.64s)]
*  Now, they recently announced that they will be frying their french fries in beef tallow [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  rather than seed oils. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  So I caught up with the secretary at one of the Florida locations of Steak and Shake for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=47.34s)]
*  a wide-ranging interview. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's play part one. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=54.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for doing this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=56.88s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=58.04s)]
*  Before you got here, I already had a burger, so I'm having a... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=60.4s)]
*  I'm breaking my diet. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=63.92s)]
*  I am pretty much full on keto. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=65.48s)]
*  I eat basically meat and eggs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=69.36s)]
*  I made an exception today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=70.92s)]
*  I had it on a bun, and I really enjoyed it, actually, and it was really good. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=72.48s)]
*  Explain the difference between seed oil and tallow and why this is a big deal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=77.16s)]
*  They said we are going to RFK Steak and Shake. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=84.56s)]
*  You know, processed foods and seed oil is one of the components of processed foods, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=88.48s)]
*  and that is... [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=95.12s)]
*  All the science indicates that ultra-processed foods are the principal culprit in this extraordinary [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=96.92s)]
*  explosion, the epidemic we have of chronic disease. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  My uncle was president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=108.88s)]
*  3% of Americans have chronic disease. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=110.68s)]
*  Today, 60% do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  We have 66% of adults are diabetic or pre-diabetic, 38% of teens. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=115.68s)]
*  When you and I were kids, Sean, the average pediatrician would see one case of juvenile [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  diabetes in his lifetime, over a 40- or 50-year career. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=127.36s)]
*  Today, one out of every three kids who walks through his office door is diabetic or pre-diabetic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=130.96s)]
*  And other mitochondrial diseases are now costing America more than our military budget. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  We spend two to three times on health care, what other countries do, and we have the worst [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=144.48s)]
*  outcomes, and we have the best medical system in the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=149.32s)]
*  We are poisoning ourselves, and it's coming from principally these ultra-processed foods [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  and what we're trying to do, and this President Trump wants us to have radical transparency [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=161.48s)]
*  and to incentivize companies like this one to switch to traditional ingredients like beef tallow. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=168.04s)]
*  Oh, by the way, here you go. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=179.48s)]
*  If you want to just take the red mask, I'll take those trades back for you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=181.48s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=184.48s)]
*  This is you, Sean. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=185.48s)]
*  Oh, this is me? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=186.48s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=187.48s)]
*  And, Secretary, this is for you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=188.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=191.48s)]
*  You didn't forget my Coke, did you? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=192.48s)]
*  Get your Coke. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=194.48s)]
*  I got some of this small with the little ice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=195.48s)]
*  I'm not going to drink it all because he's going to yell at me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=197.48s)]
*  I'm only kidding. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=200.48s)]
*  And Steak and Shake just switched out, and people are raving about these French fries. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=202.48s)]
*  You taste them, I taste them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=206.48s)]
*  They really are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=208.48s)]
*  When I was a kid and I travel in Europe, the, you know, Europe is great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=209.48s)]
*  Always had great food. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=216.48s)]
*  The French fries were always disappointment because we had the best French fries here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=217.48s)]
*  They had palm frites over there and they just didn't taste right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=221.48s)]
*  Today, the best French fries in the world are in Europe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=224.48s)]
*  I order them every time I go to Belgium or France or any place else. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=227.48s)]
*  And the French fries here just don't taste right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=231.48s)]
*  And you taste these. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=234.48s)]
*  It's a completely different experience. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=237.48s)]
*  The customers are raving about it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=239.48s)]
*  Other companies, Steak and Shake has been great. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=241.48s)]
*  We're very grateful for them for RFKing the French fries. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=244.48s)]
*  They turned me into a verb. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=247.48s)]
*  But also Popeyes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=249.48s)]
*  By the way, a plastic straw. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=252.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=254.48s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=255.48s)]
*  I can't stand those paper straws. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=256.48s)]
*  I hate them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=258.48s)]
*  You hate the sea turtles, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=259.48s)]
*  But Popeyes, Outback, Sweet Greens, Buffalo Wild. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=261.48s)]
*  Buffalo Wild Wings. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=270.48s)]
*  They've all made the switch or they're in the transition to make the switch. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=271.48s)]
*  We want to do everything that we can to incentivize these companies to be transparent, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=276.48s)]
*  to switch over from ultra-processed food and to be part of this movement to make America healthier. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=280.48s)]
*  As Health and Human Services Secretary, there is great paranoia and fear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=287.48s)]
*  You're going to force people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=294.48s)]
*  You're going to take things away from people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=296.48s)]
*  You're going to force companies to do what this Steak and Shake has freely decided to do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=298.48s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=305.48s)]
*  I have a libertarian outlook. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=307.48s)]
*  People should be able to make their own choices. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=309.48s)]
*  If you want to eat a donut or seed oils, you should be able to. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=311.48s)]
*  You should be able to exercise informed choice. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=316.48s)]
*  You should know what that product is, what's in your food, and what the health impacts are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=320.48s)]
*  That's all we're going to do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=326.48s)]
*  We're going to incentivize people to, we're going to incentivize companies to be transparent. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=328.48s)]
*  And we're going to inform Americans about what's making them sick. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=334.48s)]
*  Nobody wants to be sick. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=338.48s)]
*  I don't want to be sick. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=340.48s)]
*  Why is, okay, beef tallow, seed oil, but then there are other healthy oils. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=342.48s)]
*  Like, for example, avocado oil is considered healthy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=348.48s)]
*  Or olive oil. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=352.48s)]
*  Or butter. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=354.48s)]
*  Butter, but my daughter, who's like you, she comes, she went into my house a couple years ago [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=356.48s)]
*  and she like wiped out the smart balance, wiped out the margarine, wiped out any seed oil. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=362.48s)]
*  Good for her. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=367.48s)]
*  And she cleaned out my whole pantry and she bought me the things that she said, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=368.48s)]
*  daddy, this is much better because I like to cook. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=371.48s)]
*  And she wants you to live for a long time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=374.48s)]
*  I want to live for a long time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=376.48s)]
*  That's why I watch my weight. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=378.48s)]
*  I watch what I eat. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=379.48s)]
*  You know, I try to take care of myself. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=380.48s)]
*  Here are the numbers that really scare me though. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=382.48s)]
*  And 66% of adults, 38% of teens, and we'll put this up on the screen, they have pre-diabetes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=385.48s)]
*  I didn't order that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=394.48s)]
*  He did not order that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=398.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=399.48s)]
*  It looks great. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=400.48s)]
*  I'm sure one of our guys, would anyone like a free shake? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=401.48s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=404.48s)]
*  We've got to be somebody in here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=405.48s)]
*  But I want to go back. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=407.48s)]
*  Maybe we can just. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=409.48s)]
*  You want to? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=410.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=413.48s)]
*  80% of American adults, 50% of teens are overweight and obese. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=414.48s)]
*  We have an obesity epidemic in this country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=418.48s)]
*  77%, according to the Pentagon, Americans do not qualify for the military because of their health. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=421.48s)]
*  40% of our teenagers struggle with anxiety now and depression. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=428.48s)]
*  Which, you know, there are studies coming out of Stanford and Harvard [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=433.48s)]
*  that show a lot of mental illness, including anxiety and depression, are related to food. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=438.48s)]
*  And that changing your diet, food is medicine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=443.48s)]
*  By changing your diet, you can lose some of those diagnoses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=446.48s)]
*  And, you know, this, Sean, is a uniquely American problem. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=450.48s)]
*  This is not happening like it is here elsewhere in the world. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=455.48s)]
*  In my uncle's presence, 3% of Americans were obese. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=459.48s)]
*  As you pointed out, it's now close to 80% of adults, 50% of children. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=463.48s)]
*  But in Japan, it's still 3%. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=469.48s)]
*  Because they don't eat this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=471.48s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=473.48s)]
*  Don't they live on average 10 years longer than men here? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=474.48s)]
*  Yeah, and this generation of our kids is the first generation in 200 years that is going to have a shorter lifespan than their parents. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=477.48s)]
*  Scary. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=486.48s)]
*  We are, you know, we are letting down these kids. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=487.48s)]
*  And there's a moral issue here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=490.48s)]
*  And we need to start grappling with it because it's a moral issue. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=492.48s)]
*  It's a financial issue. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=497.48s)]
*  The health care costs are going to sink us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=499.48s)]
*  And the only way that we're going to solve it is by changing what we eat. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=502.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg&t=517.48s)]
