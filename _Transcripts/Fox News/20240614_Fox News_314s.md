# The VP should follow in Trump’s footsteps: Sen. Tim Scott
**Fox News:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k)
*  All right, here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Tim Scott, always wonderful to have you, particularly tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=4.0s)]
*  Thank you, Kayleigh. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=7.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for being here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=8.8s)]
*  So, Thursday, you're in a meeting with former President Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=10.4s)]
*  You said it was a very unifying meeting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=13.24s)]
*  We know, for instance, Senator Mitt Romney was not supposed to be there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=14.72s)]
*  He ended up coming. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=17.56s)]
*  Well, in this meeting, Trump said that one of his potential V.P. picks, perhaps the pick, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=18.56s)]
*  could be in the room. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=24.48s)]
*  You were in the room. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=25.8s)]
*  Not only that, Punchbowl reported that you were the most talked about person on the shortlist. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=27.32s)]
*  So the question I have for you, as it's a real possibility that you could get that vice [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=32.72s)]
*  presidential nod, is what you want your portfolio to look like. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=36.2s)]
*  We know Kamala tried to be border czar. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=40.16s)]
*  She tried voting rights. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=42.28s)]
*  None of it has worked. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  What would you want to hone as your issue? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=44.8s)]
*  Well, the most important thing is you're right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=47.92s)]
*  It's not the who, though. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=51.32s)]
*  It's not whether it's me or somebody else. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=52.32s)]
*  It's the what. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=54.32s)]
*  The portfolio of the vice president should always reinforce the priorities of the president. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=55.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's priorities are very simple. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=60.4s)]
*  Let's close our southern border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=62.68s)]
*  Ten million illegal immigrants coming across our border is the greatest invasion in American [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=64.72s)]
*  history. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=70.72s)]
*  We need to have someone who takes responsibility and closes the border by following in the footsteps [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=71.72s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=78.16s)]
*  We know what to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=79.36s)]
*  We know the remain in Mexico policy was quite effective. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=80.4s)]
*  We know that changing the asylum rules actually reduces the number of folks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=84.46s)]
*  What we know doesn't work is granting amnesty like Joe Biden wants to do to a whole group [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=89.3s)]
*  of hundreds of thousands of people here illegally. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=95.3s)]
*  By doing that, you only open the door and attract more people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=99.22s)]
*  Number two, the next vice president of the United States will follow in Donald Trump's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=104.02s)]
*  footsteps as it relates to the economy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  First time home buyers are devastated by 7% mortgage rates. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=113.1s)]
*  We know without any question under Donald Trump, inflation was 1.4%. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  Home mortgage rates were around 3%. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  We're going to have to have someone willing to tackle the economy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=129.5s)]
*  We need to get back to the lowest unemployment rates like we had under Donald Trump for every [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  demographic, 50 year low for the majority population, 70 year low, Kayleigh, for women, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=139.82s)]
*  and the lowest ever for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=146.62s)]
*  Whoever the vice president is should follow the lead of President Trump. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  He's done it once. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=157.5s)]
*  He'll do it again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=158.66s)]
*  And let me just wrap this up with this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=159.78s)]
*  Crime is devastating the poorest communities in our country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=162.94s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=167.86s)]
*  Donald Trump believes in law and order. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=168.86s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=172.34s)]
*  I mean, I saw that firsthand. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=173.34s)]
*  You know, Senator, one of the interesting quotes that I saw this morning goes in convention [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=175.02s)]
*  of, in contravention, I should say, of all the data. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=180.02s)]
*  All the data shows that Trump is gaining among the black community. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=182.5s)]
*  He's exceeding 20% support. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=185.38s)]
*  He's going to new heights. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  But Congressman Jim Clyburn had some thoughts on that with Politico Playbook. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=188.78s)]
*  Let's roll it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=193.66s)]
*  I think Joe Biden is doing exactly what he needs to do to win reelection. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=194.82s)]
*  I think the polling has taken place. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=201.54s)]
*  Something is amiss with the polling. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=205.66s)]
*  I don't know what's happening here, but I do know this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=207.26s)]
*  Anybody who believes that Donald Trump will get 30% of the black male vote or 12% of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=211.54s)]
*  black female vote, I got a bridge down there on Johns Island and I'll sell you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=223.38s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=230.9s)]
*  Well, if that bridge leads to Keewaw Island, one of the greatest tourist destinations in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=234.14s)]
*  all of the country, I might buy that bridge, number one. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=238.98s)]
*  Number two, I take that bet. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=241.3s)]
*  I will take that bet. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=243.74s)]
*  I can tell you, Donald Trump can exceed 30% of the black male vote in America. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=245.62s)]
*  Two big reasons why. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=253.42s)]
*  Number one, jobs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=255.22s)]
*  Number two, justice. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=257.02s)]
*  Let's dive into the numbers on the jobs reports under Donald Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=258.9s)]
*  The lowest average workers in America, their wages went up faster than the guys at the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=263.82s)]
*  top. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=270.06s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that unemployment went down. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=271.5s)]
*  Enthusiasm went up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=275.5s)]
*  The labor force participation rate, a fancy way of saying more people came back to the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=277.26s)]
*  workforce and it went up under Donald Trump. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=282.38s)]
*  The exact opposite is happening under Joe Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=286.7s)]
*  We're seeing the employment numbers go up, but labor force participation, it is weaker [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=290.54s)]
*  now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=296.7s)]
*  Senator Scott, I'm up against a hard break. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=297.7s)]
*  Let me say it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=299.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=300.18s)]
*  Up against a hard break. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58czueQio9k&t=301.18s)]
