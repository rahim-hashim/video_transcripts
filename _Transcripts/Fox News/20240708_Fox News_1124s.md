# Donald Trump: Biden's voice was 'weak' during the debate
**Fox News:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA)
*  And tonight, chaos is brewing in the Democratic Party as calls for Joe Biden to drop out are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=0.0s)]
*  growing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=7.12s)]
*  Joining us now for an exclusive interview on the phone, former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, great to have you, sir. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=12.4s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=13.84s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, John. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=14.84s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=16.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=17.52s)]
*  Let's go back to the debate with you and President Biden, because immediately you could notice [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=18.52s)]
*  his voice was raspy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=26.36s)]
*  But beyond that, within minutes, I could tell this was not going to be a good night for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=28.28s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=33.96s)]
*  What was going through your head at that time? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, it was a big evening and you could feel a lot of energy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=37.96s)]
*  Boy, energy like you haven't felt in a long time on any of the debates. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=43.04s)]
*  I've done a lot of debates and we've had great success with debates, but this was something [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=47.68s)]
*  very special. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  And when I got to Atlanta and this was at CNN headquarters, there was a lot of excitement. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=54.04s)]
*  There were trucks, I call them the $10 million trucks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=61.92s)]
*  That's with the antennas all over and very incredible equipment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=64.36s)]
*  I'm looking at things that are, you know, it was just more of a scene than it normally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=68.24s)]
*  would be. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  And it really was that way right from the start, right from the moment they introduced [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=74.68s)]
*  us and then they introduced him and introduced me and I walked out on his arm and he looked [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=79.84s)]
*  extremely pale, to put it nicely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=86.44s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe it was a good makeup job or maybe it wasn't, but he was a very [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=89.84s)]
*  pale looking man. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And when he started to speak, I don't know, I thought his voice was weak. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=96.16s)]
*  I didn't know exactly what was happening. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  It was strange. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=102.2s)]
*  I do have to say that the CNN, Jake and Dana, they were really, they were pretty good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=103.2s)]
*  They were, they really, they were, I thought they were fair. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=111.08s)]
*  I thought they were fair in the questions I thought to him, to me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=114.44s)]
*  But it was a strange evening, I will tell you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  It was a strange debate because within a couple of minutes, the answers given by him were, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=120.48s)]
*  they didn't, they didn't make a lot of sense. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=126.56s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  I think some of the worst moments for President Biden were when he wasn't talking, there was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=131.72s)]
*  like this blank, vacant stare and it's like he was checked out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  And I've run a montage of it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=145.04s)]
*  When you were speaking and you'd look over, did you notice that too or? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=148.44s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about what I was saying. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=152.92s)]
*  I wasn't looking over at him almost at all, except when he went a little bit haywire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  I didn't look at him at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=161.24s)]
*  And I'm very disappointed in him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=163.84s)]
*  He's the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=165.56s)]
*  We've never had anything like it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  What he's done to our borders, what he's done to our country, inflation, the people that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  he's hurting, he's destroying Social Security, destroying Social Security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=174.72s)]
*  And people are, you know, I'm just so upset with him as president. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=180.12s)]
*  And so I wasn't really looking over. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=184.68s)]
*  I purposely wasn't. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=186.84s)]
*  And I did take a couple of peeks when he was in the midst of giving some really bad answers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  They weren't even answers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=195.04s)]
*  They were just words put together that had no meaning or sense. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=196.04s)]
*  But for the most part, I didn't really look over. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Since before the 2020 election on radio and TV, I have chronicled the fact that Joe looked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  weak and frail and that he was a cognitive mess long before the election in 2020. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  The media, I call them state-run media, Democrats, they're all acting shocked, like this just [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  came out of nowhere. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=222.88s)]
*  Is this one incident or is it, you know, is this something permanent? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, did they not notice the guy can't give a press conference? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=229.72s)]
*  Did they not notice that he doesn't use the big boy stares getting on Air Force One? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  Did they not notice the plan to surround him as he walks to and from Marine One? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=238.48s)]
*  And he wouldn't do a Super Bowl interview, a layup interview for any president, really. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  What part of his cognitive decline do you think they missed or did they purposely cover [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  for him in your view? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=256.52s)]
*  Well, they cover for him and they still are sort of covering. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=258.0s)]
*  But now it's getting very difficult to do that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=262.56s)]
*  And you know, it looks to me like he may very well stay and he's got an ego and he doesn't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=264.88s)]
*  want to quit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=268.76s)]
*  He doesn't want to do that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=270.32s)]
*  It just looks to me like that's what he wants. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=271.32s)]
*  I think Jill would like to see him stay. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=273.44s)]
*  She's having a good time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=276.56s)]
*  I noticed she's really seems to be having a good time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=278.08s)]
*  And I'm hearing that Hunter is calling the shots. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=280.4s)]
*  So this isn't necessarily a very positive thing for our country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=284.44s)]
*  But I think he, you know, might very well stay in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=288.56s)]
*  And if he does, nobody wants to give that up that way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  He's going to feel badly about himself for a long time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=298.96s)]
*  I mean, you really have to speak to his doctors. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=303.56s)]
*  But obviously he's been sheltered by the fake news media. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=305.68s)]
*  That's why they call it the fake news. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=309.68s)]
*  Do you, Mr. President, do you want Joe Biden to step aside? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=312.48s)]
*  Do you care? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=318.32s)]
*  Well, we've prepared for him, but I don't think it's going to matter. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=321.04s)]
*  We have we had a great four years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=324.2s)]
*  Our border was the strongest ever. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=326.8s)]
*  Our economy pre-COVID was incredible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=329.56s)]
*  The best ever. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=332.82s)]
*  But then when we got hit with the gift from China, the China virus, that came in and we [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=334.42s)]
*  did a fantastic job. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=339.78s)]
*  And we got it back where the stock market was actually higher to just prior to COVID [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=341.06s)]
*  coming in. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=346.26s)]
*  So, I mean, we've done a job. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=347.26s)]
*  The military, we defeated ISIS, took out the worst terrorists in the world and defeated [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=349.42s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=353.78s)]
*  That was a big thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=354.78s)]
*  I was told it would take five years and it took us a couple of months. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=355.78s)]
*  The military is fantastic. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  By the way, the military is not woke. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=361.1s)]
*  The people at top are woke. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=362.86s)]
*  But the military is never going to be woke. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  Those are incredible people. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=366.3s)]
*  What they did for me in the fight on ISIS. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=367.62s)]
*  And then we had no wars. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=370.22s)]
*  I mean, I had no wars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=371.22s)]
*  We're heading into World War Three, in my opinion, with this man semi-running things, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=372.66s)]
*  because he's not running things. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=377.1s)]
*  The people that surround the Oval Office, the people that surround the Resolute Desk, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  the beautiful Resolute Desk, they're really running things in Washington, I suspect. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=383.94s)]
*  And it's very bad. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=388.62s)]
*  You know, he got them into the warfare and lawfare. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=390.1s)]
*  Many different terms you can use, but basically going after your political opponent, using [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=395.46s)]
*  the Justice Department, using local DAs, using local attorney generals, going after your [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=399.98s)]
*  political opponent. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=406.06s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=407.66s)]
*  And you know, there are those. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=409.3s)]
*  I just read an article that it was a — it's been a positive for me, but it's not a positive. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=410.9s)]
*  It's very unfair. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=415.22s)]
*  It's fighting an unfair battle. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=416.22s)]
*  But he's the one that got us into that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=418.54s)]
*  And all these lawsuits you see and everything else, that's all Biden-inspired, meaning [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=421.3s)]
*  Biden people-inspired. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=425.14s)]
*  And it's a — you know, very sad. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=428.38s)]
*  I think it's a very sad time for our country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=430.14s)]
*  We're not respected anywhere in the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=432.7s)]
*  He's not respected. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=434.78s)]
*  And our country's in very serious trouble. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=436.78s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, if we're not careful, we're going to be right in the middle of World [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=438.82s)]
*  War Three. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=442.14s)]
*  And that will be a war like nobody's seen before because of the weaponry. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=443.14s)]
*  The weaponry is a whole lot different than two army tanks going up against each other. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=447.38s)]
*  This is a whole different world. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=452.02s)]
*  And we don't have somebody that can properly represent us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  What do you make of all the talk that if Biden steps aside or is pushed out, that it would [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=460.9s)]
*  be Vice President Harris? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  Do you expect that much would change? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=468.94s)]
*  Well, I think that it will be her. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=472.05999999999995s)]
*  I think they are very concerned about the vote, if it's not her. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  They are very, very — I mean, they're gun-shy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=479.22s)]
*  They don't want to do it any other way. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=482.74s)]
*  I've actually come to believe that's what they're going to do. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=484.74s)]
*  I think she's an ineffective person. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=488.54s)]
*  She was in charge of the border. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=491.26s)]
*  She's never been there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=492.58s)]
*  She didn't do a good job, and she hasn't done a job on a lot of things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=494.18s)]
*  But it would seem to me that from a political standpoint, that's who they're going with. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=498.38s)]
*  They're not even talking about alternatives. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  And it seems that if he gets out, for whatever reason — and I don't think he wants to get [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=505.94s)]
*  out — but if he gets out, it will be her. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly, he's got a lot of power because he's got the delegates. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=515.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, when you have the delegates, unless he says, I'm getting out, they can't do anything [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=518.86s)]
*  to get him out. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=523.74s)]
*  Other than the 25th Amendment, if they want to do it in a different route, it would be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=524.74s)]
*  the 25th Amendment. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=528.58s)]
*  But let's assume with not very much time left. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=530.26s)]
*  You know, there's not much time left, and then we can straighten out our country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=534.42s)]
*  We'll make America great again, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=537.86s)]
*  But there's not a lot of time left. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=540.74s)]
*  But I think unless they use the 25th Amendment, which they'd use in a different sense, he [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=542.86s)]
*  has all the power. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=548.18s)]
*  He has the delegates. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=549.18s)]
*  He doesn't have to get out. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=550.26s)]
*  There's nothing they can do to get him out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=551.26s)]
*  So he'll get the nomination. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=554.02s)]
*  She got the nomination. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=555.02s)]
*  And then they'll have their meeting in Chicago, which, by the way, last week, 117 people were [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=556.38s)]
*  shot and 17 people were killed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=564.22s)]
*  That was last weekend in Chicago. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=566.62s)]
*  That's like — that's like a war zone. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=569.46s)]
*  But they have their convention in Chicago. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=572.1s)]
*  And they're obviously very proud of Chicago. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=574.54s)]
*  And I love Chicago. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=576.74s)]
*  I have investments in Chicago. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=578.5799999999999s)]
*  But when you look at the crime in Chicago, when you look at what's gone wrong with Chicago, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=580.34s)]
*  it's not a very good thing to be displaying right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=585.74s)]
*  I still think every election is about the future. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=588.9s)]
*  It's about peace and prosperity. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=593.98s)]
*  In this case, it would be about the border. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=596.22s)]
*  It will be about the economy, law and order, the green agenda, America's role in the world. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=598.3s)]
*  One issue that pops almost at the top of every poll in the minds of Americans — well, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=603.98s)]
*  really two — the border and the economy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=609.42s)]
*  Let's start with the border. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=612.6999999999999s)]
*  We have nearly 11 million unvetted, Joe Biden-illegal immigrants in this country from nearly 180 [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  countries, but many from countries that have terror ties, countries like Iran and Syria, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=620.14s)]
*  Egypt, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, nearly 60,000 from China in just the last [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  18 months, tens of thousands from Russia. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=635.6999999999999s)]
*  And I worry that this is now a clear and present danger for the country and that the likelihood [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=639.94s)]
*  that terror cells are probably already here is very high. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=645.74s)]
*  I don't think I'm wrong. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=649.38s)]
*  I pray to God that I'm wrong. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=650.5s)]
*  I don't believe I am. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=651.82s)]
*  And the media, Democrats, you know, have ignored the issue and they've allowed it to happen. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=653.62s)]
*  And Biden and Kamala Harris and Mayorkas have all said the border's closed and the border's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=659.42s)]
*  secure, but they brag about ending the policies that you had in place when they got into the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=664.78s)]
*  power. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=669.9000000000001s)]
*  I think a preventable problem. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=671.46s)]
*  I'm worried about our national security like never before. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=675.5s)]
*  Well, the one thing you haven't said tonight that you always say is that it's 100 percent [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=678.58s)]
*  certain that we're going to have a terror attack. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=685.2600000000001s)]
*  And I agree with you on that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=687.22s)]
*  It's 100 percent certain. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=688.46s)]
*  I mean, we're letting — [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=689.7s)]
*  I always say — I pray I'm wrong. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=690.9000000000001s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=694.7s)]
*  Terrorists are coming in, and they're coming in, Sean, from mental institutions and insane [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=695.74s)]
*  asylums. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=705.94s)]
*  They're coming in from prisons and jails from all over the world, all over the world, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=706.94s)]
*  not just South America. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=711.34s)]
*  They're coming in from the Congo and Africa. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=712.34s)]
*  They're coming in from every part of the world. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=714.94s)]
*  And some of these parts are rough parts of the world. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=718.9000000000001s)]
*  And they're pouring into our country as prisoners, as mental patients. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=721.9s)]
*  They're coming into our country, and they're coming in also as terrorists. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=726.1s)]
*  And this is poisoning our country. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=729.7s)]
*  And nobody should have been subjected to this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=732.54s)]
*  They should never have been allowed to do this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  There's nothing good that can come of it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=737.78s)]
*  And we're going to have to get these criminals — and a lot of them are criminals, and very [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  high-level, very bad criminals — we're going to get them out. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=744.22s)]
*  We're going to have the largest deportation in our history, larger than the Eisenhower [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=747.98s)]
*  deportation. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=752.22s)]
*  And we have no choice. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=753.22s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=754.22s)]
*  But this man has destroyed our country. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=755.7800000000001s)]
*  And I say in rallies — I'm doing a big one tomorrow at Daral in Miami — I say at rallies [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  that you could take the 10 worst presidents in the history of our country and put them [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=763.86s)]
*  together. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=768.0600000000001s)]
*  They will not have done the destruction and damage as this man has done. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  He's been a horrible president. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=774.58s)]
*  The worst president — frankly, the worst president in history by far. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=776.14s)]
*  And by the way, Jimmy Carter is the happiest guy around because Jimmy Carter now is saying, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=780.34s)]
*  you know — I mean, he was like a genius compared to what Biden is. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=784.9s)]
*  His administration was brilliant compared to the Biden administration. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=788.38s)]
*  So it's a very, very sad — it's a very sad time in our country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=793.6999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask about the economy. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=798.22s)]
*  I know that they said from the beginning that Biden's inflation, which they inherited 1.4 [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  percent, it's up over 20 percent. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=805.5s)]
*  Twenty-five percent of Americans say that they've had to forego meals. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=808.86s)]
*  Sixty-plus percent of Americans said that they're gulping water because of Joe Biden's [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=813.0999999999999s)]
*  economic policies and Biden inflation. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=817.9799999999999s)]
*  How do you fix that? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=821.78s)]
*  And how quickly do you think you can fix that? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=823.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, we have to fix it fast. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=825.9399999999999s)]
*  And what they're doing is the illegal migrants that are pouring into our countries, many [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=828.3s)]
*  of them are staying in luxury hotels all over our country. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=833.06s)]
*  They're being shipped up. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=836.5s)]
*  You know, as we say now, every state is a border state, whether it's Idaho or Iowa [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=837.5s)]
*  or Ohio. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=844.62s)]
*  It doesn't make any difference. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=845.62s)]
*  They're all border — because they're pouring through our country. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=847.5799999999999s)]
*  One of the stats that was incredible — I actually saw it on You First — was when [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=851.22s)]
*  they — it was — it came out that we're actually flying them in. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=855.46s)]
*  So it's not just a question of these people coming through totally unchecked and unvetted. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=859.0600000000001s)]
*  They're flying tens of thousands of people into our country — migrants. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=863.4200000000001s)]
*  And many of these people were not people that were welcome to stay in their countries. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=869.1s)]
*  They're coming up here. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=873.62s)]
*  And when I originally said — I said they are not sending their finest. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  These are people that are coming from other countries, Sean, where the president, the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=880.22s)]
*  whoever is running the country, including the dictators, they're sending them into [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=887.1s)]
*  our country. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=891.1s)]
*  And if you look at Venezuela, their crime is down 72 percent. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=892.5s)]
*  Their crime — think of it — down 72, and ours is up. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=896.26s)]
*  And we're going to have a new form of crime, because these people are just getting comfortable. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=899.66s)]
*  They're just getting settled in. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=903.1s)]
*  We're going to have a new form of crime, and it's called Biden migrant crime. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=904.82s)]
*  And that's — it's a new category. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=909.64s)]
*  And it's a very serious category. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=911.98s)]
*  And it might blow all of our crime out the window, because, frankly, you could probably [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  double. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=918.5799999999999s)]
*  When I told you those numbers in Chicago were 17 people dying this weekend — think [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=919.5799999999999s)]
*  of it, over a weekend, over a three-day period, four-day period, you had over 100 people shot [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=924.8199999999999s)]
*  and 17 people dead. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=931.34s)]
*  And that probably doesn't include the migrants, although I guarantee you there was some of [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=934.02s)]
*  that in there, too. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=938.3s)]
*  We have a new form. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=939.5799999999999s)]
*  And it's this new category, and it's going to be very, very serious for a long time to [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=940.58s)]
*  come. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=944.94s)]
*  And we have to get them out of our country. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=945.94s)]
*  We don't want them out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=947.9000000000001s)]
*  They drop them out of their jails and prisons. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=948.9000000000001s)]
*  We don't want them in our country. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=951.0s)]
*  It's not sustainable by any country. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=953.38s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=956.98s)]
*  When you came down that escalator in 2015 and you said some are very good people, they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=957.98s)]
*  want a better life, and then there are going to be bad people, and there'll be murder [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=961.94s)]
*  and rape, it's unfolding. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=965.58s)]
*  Look at Lake and Riley on down and young girls being raped in broad daylight, this young [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=968.86s)]
*  girl in Texas that was killed, the mother of five. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=973.38s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question, if I may. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=976.82s)]
*  And I know this was last minute. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=978.94s)]
*  Thanks for calling in tonight. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=980.4200000000001s)]
*  And I want to ask you about your VP choice. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=982.86s)]
*  How soon do you think you'll be making that choice, number one? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=986.62s)]
*  Number two, we keep reading that there is a short list, and on the short list we hear [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=989.98s)]
*  names like Senator Rubio, Senator Tim Scott, Senator J.D. Vance, Governor Burgum. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=995.22s)]
*  Is that are those reports accurate? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1003.3000000000001s)]
*  Are there other people maybe people aren't paying attention to? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1006.74s)]
*  And when do you think you'll announce that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1009.94s)]
*  Well, you know, we started off with a lot of people who have a lot of good people as [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1011.7s)]
*  they call it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1015.98s)]
*  We have a great bench in the Republican Party. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1016.98s)]
*  The names that you mentioned absolutely they're under consideration. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1019.22s)]
*  And I haven't made final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1023.2199999999999s)]
*  And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest, because, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1027.7s)]
*  you know, it might make a difference. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1031.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1032.3s)]
*  I'm not sure that it would. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1033.3s)]
*  But there are those that say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1034.3s)]
*  with crooked Joe Biden. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1037.26s)]
*  And we'll see what happens with Biden. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1039.26s)]
*  But you know, I think probably within the next week, we could have probably sometime. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1041.78s)]
*  I'd love to do it during the convention. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1047.5s)]
*  My people say that's a little complicated. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1049.82s)]
*  You know, in the old days, they would announce the vice president during the convention. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1051.7s)]
*  Today with modern day technology, you can't do things that you could have done 50 years [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1056.18s)]
*  ago very easily. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1061.06s)]
*  But probably a little before the convention, but not much. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1062.54s)]
*  It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1066.4199999999998s)]
*  I'd love to do it during the convention. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1069.06s)]
*  I think it would be a very interesting buildup and important for the convention. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1070.62s)]
*  It would make it even more exciting. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1074.4199999999998s)]
*  It's going to be amazing in Milwaukee. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1076.26s)]
*  If you announced it right now on this show, I think it would make a lot of news. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1079.3s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1082.86s)]
*  Well, if I did it, I'd love to do it with you. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1083.86s)]
*  But we'll be announcing soon. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1087.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think everybody's going to be very, very happy. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1088.58s)]
*  The choice will be very, very good. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1091.3s)]
*  It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1093.26s)]
*  because you always have to think of that first. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1100.22s)]
*  And then second, somebody that helps you get elected. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1102.1399999999999s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1108.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1110.3s)]
*  Thank you very much, John. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVWhLnaMrA&t=1111.46s)]
