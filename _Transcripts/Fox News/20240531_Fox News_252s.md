# Alan Dershowitz advises Trump attorney to 'move immediately' for sentencing: 'Timing is everything'
**Fox News:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4)
*  We go now to the author of the book, Get Trump, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Fox [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=0.0s)]
*  News legal analyst, Greg Jarrett is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Greg, let me start with you and let me start with the question of what is next, what should [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=8.8s)]
*  be next? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=13.24s)]
*  If you're advising the Trump legal team, what would you advise them? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=14.44s)]
*  What would the next steps be as we head into this July 11 sentencing? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=18.6s)]
*  Well, I think you have to look to an appeal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=23.48s)]
*  And you know, higher court judges in New York, Sean, are just like Mershon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=27.8s)]
*  I mean, they're mini-mes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=31.2s)]
*  This is a liberal, politically driven club. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  They protect their own. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=36.4s)]
*  So I'm not optimistic at the former president's chances to overturn the conviction, which [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=38.2s)]
*  means that Trump's only real relief is in the federal courts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  But that's the proper venue anyway, because as Jonathan pointed out, most of the egregious [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=49.88s)]
*  violations by the judge, these were constitutional due process rights, for example, refusing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=55.36s)]
*  to tell the defendant what this conspiracy crime was. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=63.12s)]
*  We still don't know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=67.24s)]
*  That's a clear violation of the Sixth Amendment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=69.6s)]
*  And then of course, telling the jury they can forget all about a unanimity. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=72.2s)]
*  That is a bedrock constitutional right derived from the Sixth and Seventh Amendment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Judge Mershon made a mockery of that, as well as justice, with a multitude of reversible [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=83.04s)]
*  errors that are quite shocking, I think, to everyone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=90.0s)]
*  And it's not, it is the federal courts, not state courts, that they're the ones who tend [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=93.48s)]
*  to scrupulously guard our due process rights. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  So you know, there may be a dual track here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  You've got to go through the state system. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=106.76s)]
*  Maybe you'll get lucky and, you know, some judges with a conscience who are schooled [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=109.0s)]
*  in the law will look at this and say, this is fundamentally wrong, we reverse. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=114.32s)]
*  But I think in the end, it's going to be the federal courts, maybe even the Supreme Court, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=119.86s)]
*  that corrects this incredible injustice. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=124.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=128.72s)]
*  Let's get your take, Professor. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=130.28s)]
*  And what would the next steps be for you if you were talking to President Trump's attorney? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=132.64s)]
*  I would do something quite radical. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=138.28s)]
*  I would move immediately for the sentencing to occur next week, not July 11th, so that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=139.88s)]
*  you can get the appeal going. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  You can't appeal until there's a sentence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  If the court refused to expedite the sentencing, I would try to take the case now immediately [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=151.0s)]
*  to the New York Court of Appeals, skipping the intermediate Court of Appeals, which is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=155.84s)]
*  a political court, Manhattan-based, Democrats largely. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  I would try to go right to the Court of Appeals and ask them for a decision within 30 days [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=165.6s)]
*  in order to get to the Supreme Court before the election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=170.44s)]
*  There's no reason to have the sentencing delayed until July 11th. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=174.52s)]
*  The judge knows what he's going to do today. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=179.28s)]
*  Professor, why would you have any confidence that Judge Mershon would expedite the sentencing? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=181.56s)]
*  Because I have, you know, to me, I think the obvious thing to do if it was him would be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=187.84s)]
*  to say, all right, you're released on your own recognizance pending appeal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=193.04s)]
*  I don't have faith he'll do that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=196.52s)]
*  No, that's not the point. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=198.72s)]
*  The point is to impose the sentence now so that there can be an appeal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=200.28s)]
*  If the judge refuses, as he would, refuses, take the case to the Court of Appeals and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=203.88s)]
*  say, Your Honors, we want the sentencing to be done now so we can appeal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=209.32s)]
*  If the judge refuses to allow the sentencing to impose, Your Honors, let us appeal now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=214.8s)]
*  We're not going to appeal necessarily the sentencing now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=220.12s)]
*  We're going to appeal the conviction. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=223.32s)]
*  So I would do everything to expedite this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=224.96s)]
*  Timing is everything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=227.68s)]
*  Very dangerous times for a constitutional republic. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=229.18s)]
*  Very dangerous. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=233.24s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=234.44s)]
*  Greg, thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=235.44s)]
*  By the way, it was fun being on Fox News with you yesterday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=236.44s)]
*  And Professor, thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-zH0Hw3a4&t=238.96s)]
