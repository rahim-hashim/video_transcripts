# Jim Jordan: This is the heart of the Hunter Biden scandal
**Fox News:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc)
*  Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, House Oversight Committee Chairman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's James Comer, and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Jason Smith. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=3.74s)]
*  Good to see you all. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Jim Jordan, let me start with you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=9.36s)]
*  Let's start with your letter to Christopher Wray, and then we'll talk about the contempt. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's an underlying 1023 form, Sean, that was earlier, back in 2017. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=15.56s)]
*  That became the basis for Scott Brady, U.S. attorney, asking to talk to the confidential [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=22.04s)]
*  human source that produced the 1023 form we have. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=26.6s)]
*  So we've asked Chris Wray to give us that form. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=29.24s)]
*  But I think when you step back and look at this week, Sean, the real big takeaway wasn't [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=31.24s)]
*  the chaos in Jamie Comer's committee yesterday, wasn't the fact that Kevin Morris, who was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=34.64s)]
*  sitting there, purchased $875,000 of Hunter Biden's art, and wasn't even what happened [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=38.36s)]
*  in L.A. today with Hunter Biden pleading not guilty of these tax charges. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=44.28s)]
*  I think the big takeaway is what David Weiss didn't charge Hunter Biden with. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=47.56s)]
*  He didn't charge him with those tax years 2014, 2015, when he got the income from Burisma. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  In fact, he let the statute of limitations expire because it's one thing to have a gun [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=57.8s)]
*  charge in Delaware. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  That doesn't get you to the White House. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=63.68s)]
*  Another thing to have tax charges in L.A., that doesn't get you to the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=64.88s)]
*  But the Burisma tax years do, and that's what's in that 1023 form. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=68.66s)]
*  That's why they want the earlier one as well, and we've asked the FBI to produce it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=73.36s)]
*  When this became an issue, why wouldn't they automatically have handed you the other 1023 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=78.28s)]
*  form? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=84.12s)]
*  In other words, were they hiding it from you? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=85.12s)]
*  It doesn't seem like they're very cooperative. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=86.76s)]
*  Great question. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if they were hiding it from us, but we learned about it when we talked to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney who Bill Barr charged with filtering all this stuff and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=93.12s)]
*  getting it out to the appropriate U.S. attorneys for investigation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=97.76s)]
*  He found it out finally after six months when they should have turned it over to him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  He's the one that asked for it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=105.68s)]
*  So once we talked to him, we felt we should go pursue and get this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=106.68s)]
*  So we're hoping that Chris Ray will turn it over. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  Let's turn to you, James Comer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about yesterday, the antics of Hunter Biden showing up. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=115.16s)]
*  And let's also explain to people what normal procedure is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=119.36s)]
*  If you get a subpoena to appear before Congress, you are deposed, that is, behind closed doors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=122.08s)]
*  And then if there's a public hearing, that would occur afterward. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=127.0s)]
*  Is that not standard procedure? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=129.56s)]
*  And when Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro did not show up, were they not charged with contempt [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=131.84s)]
*  of Congress after a recommendation by the committees? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=136.44s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=139.16s)]
*  Standard procedure. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=141.6s)]
*  You get a subpoena. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=142.6s)]
*  You come for a deposition. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=144.04s)]
*  You have to also, according to the rules, give three days notice for a deposition to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  make sure that everyone's there and everyone's prepared to ask questions and to answer questions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=149.32s)]
*  We've done everything by the book in this investigation to ensure that everything that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=154.56s)]
*  we accumulate in the form of evidence is accessible and admissible in a court of law, because [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  eventually the Bidens are going to be held accountable in a court of law. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=166.44s)]
*  Eventually we'll have this attorney general do their job, but regardless, future attorneys [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=170.36s)]
*  general will be able to use the information that we have obtained in our investigation [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  to hold these people accountable for the crimes that they've committed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=181.8s)]
*  So we did everything by the book. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Hunter Biden showed up, ironically, Sean, right when he sat down. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=188.12s)]
*  Moskowitz from Florida, the Democrat, started saying that Hunter Biden's here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=193.08s)]
*  He's here to answer questions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=197.12s)]
*  He's here to answer questions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=198.68s)]
*  And his time expired. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=200.56s)]
*  I recognize Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  She was going to ask him questions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=203.98s)]
*  When I recognize Marjorie Taylor Greene, Hunter Biden's eyeballs about popped out and he jumped [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=206.16s)]
*  up along with Abby Lowell and they ran out about in October, three or four people on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  the way out the door. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=216.04s)]
*  Let's talk to Jason Smith. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=218.04s)]
*  Let me ask you and we'll get an update on what the Ways and Means Committee want to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=219.44s)]
*  take on the contempt of Congress and whether or not you think that the same laws that were [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  applied to Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro will be applied to Hunter Biden. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=231.24s)]
*  I think them showing up yesterday during the middle of this proceeding, they just they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=235.44s)]
*  just they have to have a feeling of confidence that they're not going to be held to the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  same standard. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't have any confidence that they're going to be held to the same standard. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  But as we look at that, that two tiered system of justice, my question to you is, why shouldn't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=248.68s)]
*  Hunter be treated the same way as Bannon and Navarro? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=255.0s)]
*  Sean, Hunter should be treated exactly the same way. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=259.92s)]
*  Whenever Steve Bannon was held in contempt, within 22 days, the Justice Department brought [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  charges against Steve Bannon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=269.84s)]
*  When Hunter Biden's held in contempt, let's see if the next 22 days his father's Justice [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Department holds him in contempt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=277.6s)]
*  It is absolutely a great day for the two IRS whistleblowers, Sean, because today they were [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=279.24s)]
*  vindicated because everything that they told the House Ways and Means Committee and the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  charges that they thought Hunter Biden should be charged with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  In fact, that is why he was in court. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=295.48s)]
*  All nine of them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, as Jim said, he should have also been charged with 2014 and 15 tax crimes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=299.48s)]
*  But as the whistleblower said, the Justice Department allowed the statute of limitations [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  to run out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=309.6s)]
*  Let's go. But let me ask you, Congressman Smith, this is important here because the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=310.0s)]
*  Burisma years, remember, it was David Weiss in charge, was it not? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=314.6s)]
*  And David Weiss allowed the statute of limitations to expire. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that not true? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=321.76s)]
*  Those were the Burisma holding money years. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, if that happened and David Weiss, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't his original plan not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=325.16s)]
*  to charge Hunter? And then the whistleblowers came forward and that led to the sweetheart [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  deal that blew up in court because the judge actually read the agreement and said she'd [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  never seen anything like this in her life and even even got the defense to admit they'd [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  never seen anything like it in their lives. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=343.8s)]
*  And that only led to David Weiss finally having the power that he had at one point said he [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=345.68s)]
*  had and then said he didn't have to go after tax charges in Washington and California. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  That's exactly right, Sean. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=358.48s)]
*  What's interesting is, is that this sweetheart plea agreement, the original one, came out [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=359.88s)]
*  two days before the Ways and Means Committee released the IRS whistleblower testimony. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=365.08s)]
*  That whistleblower testimony is what blew up that sweetheart deal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=371.68s)]
*  If that sweetheart deal wouldn't have blown up, the charges would have never came in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=376.56s)]
*  California and this would have all been swept underneath the rug and the two tier justice [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=381.28s)]
*  system would have not been seen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=386.08s)]
*  They came awfully close. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=388.36s)]
*  Jim Jordan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=389.56s)]
*  Now the big question is, to me, this is not about Hunter Biden. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=390.12s)]
*  To me, this is about Joe Biden. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=393.68s)]
*  Joe Biden that said he never once spoke to his father, I'm sorry, his son or brother or [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=395.44s)]
*  anybody for that matter about their foreign business dealings. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=400.56s)]
*  Joe Biden that had extensive contact with foreign business partners and extensive contact [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=403.36s)]
*  with partners of his own son regarding financial matters. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=408.96s)]
*  Then it comes to the implication of his own son on his own laptop in communications about [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=413.04s)]
*  monies going to his father. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=419.28s)]
*  At that point, are we talking about, you know, what are we talking about here? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  If a vice president leverages a billion dollars to get a prosecutor fired after five days [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=425.55999999999995s)]

*  What do you call that? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=441.08s)]
*  You call it bribery. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  What you just described, Sean, is the facts and circumstance that took place when Joe [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  Biden went to Ukraine and conditioned the release of American tax dollar aid to Ukraine [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=448.84s)]
*  on the firing of the prosecutor who was applying the pressure to Burisma. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=454.28s)]
*  All that is corroborated by the confidential human source. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  He said the confidential human source told the FBI that the head of Burisma said we [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  hired Hunter Biden to protect us through his dad. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=465.96s)]

*  He conditioned the release of the money on firing this prosecutor. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=472.44s)]
*  His name is Victor Shokan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  He's mentioned eight times in that 1023 form. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  We're asking now for the earlier 1023 form so we can put that information together with [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=479.68s)]
*  this as well. That to me is really the heart of this matter. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  And then you have all this other evidence that Jamie and Jason have brought forward [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  from their committees that support that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  But the most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=493.64000000000004s)]

*  however many you might be up to now. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=508.28s)]
*  You talked about 10 Biden family members you've identified as getting paid. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=510.48s)]
*  We've talked about Joe's contacts with these foreign business partners and official acts [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=514.92s)]
*  that he took from the FD 1023 form, which gave us the first indication, which led to the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=519.04s)]
*  whistleblowers. Now we know that there was no ethics deal at all in terms of Hunter [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=523.68s)]
*  having no knowledge of who was buying his art. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=528.96s)]
*  But according to the art dealer, he knew who 70 percent of the buyers were. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  Were they all Democratic donors? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  At least 70 percent were Democrat donors. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=538.88s)]
*  We're trying to identify the remaining few. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=540.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you'll remember Jen Psaki told everyone after members of the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=544.6s)]
*  House Oversight Committee demanded that we know who was actually buying the art. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=549.2s)]
*  She stood up and said that they had ethics rules in place. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=554.6s)]
*  They had talked to the art dealer. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaN8MDtdNc&t=557.48s)]
