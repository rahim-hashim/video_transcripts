# Sean Hannity: Hurricane Helene victims have been abandoned by your border czar
**Fox News:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, I've got to prepare all of you to get very angry, because what we're about [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=2.52s)]
*  to share with you will rightly make your blood boil. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=6.92s)]
*  As most of you know, ports, by the way, along the East Coast were shut down this week because [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=10.44s)]
*  of a union leader's demands. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=14.84s)]
*  We have the update on that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=17.62s)]
*  And including a reported 75 percent pay raise for dock workers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=19.54s)]
*  I think now the employers are up to 62 percent. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=24.0s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of them make six figures. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=28.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris supported this shutdown, which cost you, the American people, it's costing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=30.2s)]
*  us billions of dollars a day. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=35.08s)]
*  They only kicked the can down the road. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=36.56s)]
*  The strike is temporarily on hiatus. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=38.66s)]
*  But this story can get much, much worse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=41.52s)]
*  As all of you know, much of Appalachia, the Gulf Coast of—from the Gulf Coast of Florida, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=43.52s)]
*  reeling from Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=50.28s)]
*  This was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=52.38s)]
*  These regions desperately, desperately, desperately need supplies coming through those ports, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=55.12s)]
*  which are now backed up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Last weekend, Joe was sitting without a care in the world on the beach in his little beach [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  chair. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=67.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris out hobnobbing with her rich Hollywood friends, both for the most part, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=68.8s)]
*  MIA in states that have been completely devastated. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=73.16s)]
*  But here's the real problem. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=76.84s)]
*  In North Carolina, in Georgia, in Tennessee, South Carolina, and in the state of Florida, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=78.44s)]
*  they need immediate help, especially North Carolina and Georgia, from the Federal Emergency [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=84.0s)]
*  Management Agency, or what we call FEMA. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=89.96s)]
*  It has now been a full week, and this is what we learned today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=93.92s)]
*  FEMA is out of money. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=98.4s)]
*  And wait until you hear the reason why. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=102.8s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=103.8s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=109.88s)]
*  We do not have the funds. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=112.74s)]
*  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  Now, you've got to remember, I interviewed Governor Kemp of Georgia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=118.3s)]
*  I interviewed Governor DeSantis, my state of Florida. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=123.3s)]
*  And they had both pre-positioned utility truck supplies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=126.3s)]
*  Everybody knew that a massive category four hurricane was on the way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  Joe and Kamala, they prepared for absolutely nothing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=134.62s)]
*  At the very least, they should have at least understood that they were going to run out [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=140.42s)]
*  of monies allocated for this storm. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  And where did all the money go? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  This is where your blood's really going to get hot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=149.14s)]
*  Until last week, it was a relatively calm hurricane system. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=151.66s)]
*  And here's where this story gets infuriating and beyond disgraceful. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=155.77999999999997s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, we now have learned, raided FEMA's piggy bank for other [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=160.44s)]
*  endeavors. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=167.14s)]
*  They took over $1 billion of FEMA funds supposed to be available for national emergencies to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=168.14s)]
*  help you, the American people, if, God forbid, there's an emergency as bad as this one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=176.54s)]
*  And they spent all of that money on their 11.5 million unvetted illegal immigrants from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  over 180 other countries—by the way, including countries with terror ties and our top geopolitical [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=189.7s)]
*  foes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  And they used that money for free food, housing, health care, education, sex change surgeries, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  debit cards, four-star hotels for illegal immigrants, on top of the billions and billions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=205.1s)]
*  they'd already spent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, there just aren't enough funds, what, for the people of North Carolina, South Carolina, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=212.42s)]
*  our friends in Tennessee, our friends in Georgia, our friends here in the state of Florida. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=218.66s)]
*  In the weeks since Helene, only $4 million has been distributed to Americans devastated [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  by the storm, person after person calling into my radio show saying they haven't seen [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  a single emergency worker, FEMA representative, on the ground. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=235.17999999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of Americans we know lost their lives. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=239.64s)]
*  Hundreds are now unaccounted for and missing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  People don't have homes, they don't have food, they don't have water, they don't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=246.06s)]
*  have housing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=249.6s)]
*  Up until Donald Trump contacted Elon Musk, they didn't have any communications. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=250.8s)]
*  They've been completely abandoned by your border czar, who prioritized her unvetted [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=256.12s)]
*  illegal immigrants over the American people and hasn't lifted a finger in over a week. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=262.08s)]
*  And now we find out a week later they don't have any money? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=268.76s)]
*  The little money that they have given out is described as a one-time grant that gives [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=271.8s)]
*  storm victims a lousy, what, $750? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=277.64s)]
*  Can they open their eyes? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=282.8s)]
*  Are they not aware of the devastation? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=283.96s)]
*  We don't even know how many other people are in deep trouble, because they can't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=286.64s)]
*  get to them and they haven't put the resources forward to get to them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=291.52s)]
*  You have illegal immigrants getting everything, including free sex change operations, courtesy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=296.2s)]
*  of you, the taxpayer, while American citizens in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=300.76s)]
*  South Carolina lost everything, and they get nothing but the middle finger from Joe [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=307.2s)]
*  Biden and border czar Kamala Harris. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=312.44s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=314.96s)]
*  This is rightly Kamala's Katrina on steroids and human growth hormone. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=316.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration, they've allocated close to $200 billion to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=321.88s)]
*  Ukraine, $8 billion more just last week. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=327.56s)]
*  How about we withhold that payment and give it to the people of North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  that are devastated? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=335.56s)]
*  This is an administration that has given nearly $3 billion to the Taliban, and they can't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=337.1s)]
*  help our own citizens? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=344.5s)]
*  The Taliban, the ones that have billions of dollars on our military equipment and still [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=345.86s)]
*  they're Americans caught behind enemy lines, and so many of our allies, well, they were [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=351.54s)]
*  taken out of their homes because they left a list of their names on it, never to be seen [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=356.46s)]
*  or heard from again. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=359.96s)]
*  $230 million to build a floating pier on a beach in Gaza? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=361.46s)]
*  That's what Harris and Biden did for them, you know, to rush food supplies to the Palestinians [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=366.34s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  That pier was only operational for 20 days. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  Joe and Kamala sent another $211 million in humanitarian assistance that was sent to Haiti [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  this year, $45 million to help tackle gang violence. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=382.02s)]
*  The administration gives over a billion dollars every year. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's go through some of the countries. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  The list is longer. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=391.74s)]
*  Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Somalia, Southern Sudan and many other countries across the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=392.74s)]
*  world, but, you know, Katrina Kamala stays MIA, throws crumbs to the people in North [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=399.7s)]
*  Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, especially in North Georgia, Northern [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=406.58s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=414.26s)]
*  Oh, why is that? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=415.26s)]
*  Because it's Republican areas? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=416.74s)]
*  What a repulsive disgrace. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=418.7s)]
*  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he's a pretty mild-mannered guy, baffled, stunned by the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  White House that refused to issue an emergency declaration offer that he asked for, for 90 [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=426.82000000000005s)]
*  counties in Georgia that were devastated by this hurricane. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=433.98s)]
*  He needed that declaration for 90 counties. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=437.42s)]
*  They only gave him 11. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=440.04s)]
*  He had to get back on the phone with the White House and begging Biden's chief of staff, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=441.94s)]
*  Joe was probably taking a nap, to take more action, and he only got 30 more of the 90 [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=446.5s)]
*  counties that he needed covered. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=452.38s)]
*  Again, the middle finger to Georgia, North Carolina and everyone in between. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=454.1s)]
*  Wow, pretty unbelievable. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=458.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=460.7s)]
*  When the first emergency declarations came down, there was only 11 counties in that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=462.06s)]
*  A lot of people were outraged, including me, because there was such devastation in, you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=467.3s)]
*  know, up to 90 counties. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=472.14s)]
*  So we called the White House. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=474.24s)]
*  We spoke to the president's chief of staff, the FEMA administrator, and said, look, you're [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=475.5s)]
*  sending the signal that you're not paying attention to some of these rural communities. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=480.9s)]
*  Egypt's abandoning Georgia, North Carolina and every state in between. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=485.9s)]
*  Everybody knew this hurricane was coming. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=491.66s)]
*  Governor Kemp did his job. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=494.66s)]
*  Pre-positioned utility trucks, supplies available for the people of Georgia. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=496.1s)]
*  Governor DeSantis did the same thing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=500.38s)]
*  It would be a major cat three four storm. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=503.24s)]
*  Where was the federal government and why didn't we find out till today that FEMA ran out of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=506.44s)]
*  money and why didn't Biden and Harris pre-position a thing and why did they, you know, reallocate [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=511.68s)]
*  these funds to help the 11 and a half illegals that shouldn't be in the country anyway? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=518.32s)]
*  Why did they raid FEMA funds for illegals? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=523.36s)]
*  Why isn't FEMA on the ground in these areas in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=526.24s)]
*  Georgia and Florida now? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=532.76s)]
*  And I'll say this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=534.76s)]
*  God bless the Reverend Billy, Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son and Samaritan's Purse. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=535.76s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=541.12s)]
*  I donated to them this week myself. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=542.12s)]
*  If you want to go to samaritanspurse.org, they need your help. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  And thank God for Donald Trump. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=547.2s)]
*  He actually got on the ground long before Kamala and Joe and then saw the devastation, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=549.08s)]
*  with his friend Elon Musk and Elon Musk, you know, sent in Starlink to establish communications [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=554.72s)]
*  where there was none at all whatsoever. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=560.76s)]
*  There would be zero help. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=563.72s)]
*  People would be dying without communications. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=565.28s)]
*  And according to numerous reports on the ground, the administration has been so painfully slow, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=568.24s)]
*  they're not even there now and leaving Americans to suffer and fend for themselves in communities [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=572.72s)]
*  now without roads, bridges, power, food, clean water. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=583.84s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=584.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=585.84s)]
*  We've seen our friends and neighbors lose their homes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=586.84s)]
*  We've seen classrooms of children who have no longer have their homes. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=591.6s)]
*  We are hunting for teachers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  We have 23 teachers out of our list that we haven't been able to find. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  I've been a teacher in Black Mountain for 25 years. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=605.44s)]
*  I've been a resident there for 48. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=609.4s)]
*  And we've never experienced anything like this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  Is there anything you'd love to make sure that they know, both President Biden and Kamala [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=615.88s)]
*  Harris, as they head to that region today? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=620.4s)]
*  We need so much help. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=624.54s)]
*  We don't want to be forgotten. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=626.04s)]
*  Our communities all hold hands with each other. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=628.2s)]
*  Black Mountain and Swannanoa's children go to school together. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=631.08s)]
*  We're not separate. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=634.24s)]
*  A week late and billions of dollars short, this is Kamala Harris, border czar. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=636.84s)]
*  This is her Katrina in many areas across the Southeast. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=642.08s)]
*  Communications have been totally down. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=645.96s)]
*  No cell service, no Internet, no phones. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=648.24s)]
*  Last year, let's follow the bouncing ball, shall we? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  The same Biden-Harris administration rescinded a Starlink contract, that's Elon Musk's company, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=654.24s)]
*  even when Elon was the low bidder. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=661.24s)]
*  By the way, the same Elon that's going to go save the astronauts that are lost in space, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  thanks to Kamala leading up that agency. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=668.72s)]
*  And they would have been able to connect nearly 700,000 homes to the Internet in these exact [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=671.88s)]
*  rural areas like Appalachia. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=679.32s)]
*  They clearly revoked the deal with Elon Musk for political reasons. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=681.98s)]
*  So now, Musk gets a call from Trump, is working, and to his credit, he's been able to rush [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=685.96s)]
*  Starlink terminals to the region and provide Internet service for free. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=692.64s)]
*  I talked to Billy Graham's, Franklin Graham's guy today, Samaritan's Purse today, and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=697.48s)]
*  they said they need generators to run Starlink. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=702.16s)]
*  I said, well, can I raise more money? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=704.84s)]
*  Can I give you more money? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=706.64s)]
*  Because the communications, we don't even know if people are, you know, without food [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=708.36s)]
*  and water and about to die after six days of them doing nothing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=712.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden was mentally checked out for months. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=716.48s)]
*  His VP, Kamala Harris, this is her Katrina, routinely skipping important hurricane preparedness [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  meetings. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=727.12s)]
*  She wasn't there. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=728.12s)]
*  And two years ago, she said that disaster relief aid should be provided on the basis [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=729.12s)]
*  of race and equity. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  Are we going to play politics and insert DEI into, you know, into disaster relief? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=738.36s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=744.6400000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  It is our lowest income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues that are not of their own making. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=755.5200000000001s)]
*  And so we— [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  Unwilling. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=764.9200000000001s)]
*  So we have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity, understanding [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=766.52s)]
*  that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity, understanding not everyone [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  starts out at the same place. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=776.64s)]
*  And if we want people to be in an equal place, sometimes we have to take into account those [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=779.0s)]
*  disparities. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  How about in a situation like this, how about we all band together, you help out any and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  every American based on their need, and you do it as soon as possible, and don't sit [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=789.9599999999999s)]
*  on your ass for a week like they have? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=794.16s)]
*  How about you don't steal money for illegal immigrants for their sex change operations, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=796.28s)]
*  free housing, healthcare, food, education, etc., and amnesty, and you leave the money [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=801.84s)]
*  where it belongs, in a lockbox, for emergencies when they happen, for FEMA? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=807.84s)]
*  Do the people of Appalachia just not look the right way? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=813.04s)]
*  Maybe you don't like how they vote historically, you know, and they don't deserve federal [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=816.64s)]
*  aid? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=821.36s)]
*  They're Americans. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=822.36s)]
*  You have desperately in need and have been for a week and you have abandoned them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=823.4s)]
*  In the past four years, Kamala has passionately called for billions of dollars, let's see, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=828.2s)]
*  to repay student debt, provide sex change operations, not only for illegals, but also [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=832.84s)]
*  convicts in jail, vowed to eliminate the filibuster, to spend $93 trillion on the Green New Deal, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=838.34s)]
*  a cradle to grave society. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=845.34s)]
*  By the way, any of you out there want to trust your government? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=847.28s)]
*  When it comes to hurricane victims, the passion is gone. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=850.36s)]
*  No desperate pleas for funding. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  She didn't even bother to step away from her lavish Hollywood fundraisers over the weekend. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=855.24s)]
*  Biden wouldn't come back from the beach. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=860.36s)]
*  Too lazy to get his ass out of that beach chair and do his job. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=862.96s)]
*  It took Kamala and Joe a week to visit the Southeast. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=866.7s)]
*  Remember 2005, George W. Bush mocked, ridiculed, called racist for his hurricane response to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=869.6s)]
*  Hurricane Katrina? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=877.08s)]
*  The criticism was on day two, the second day after it occurred. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=878.62s)]
*  According to the New York Times, he was blasted for not returning to Washington from his Texas [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=883.42s)]
*  vacation until Wednesday afternoon, two days after the Monday hurricane. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=888.3s)]
*  Well, and he flew over Katrina, didn't want to land and be a distraction. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=892.46s)]
*  Well, this is Kamala's Katrina. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=896.58s)]
*  She and Biden are failing the people of the Southeast. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=898.52s)]
*  She prioritized the illegal immigrants over you, the American people. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=901.62s)]
*  She talks a big game about equity, but doesn't seem to give a damn when people are truly [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=905.82s)]
*  in need. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=910.44s)]
*  And today, former President Trump said that this has been the worst hurricane response [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=911.44s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=915.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=916.62s)]
*  Now we have a horrific disaster in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=917.86s)]
*  Florida and Virginia. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=923.86s)]
*  That's how big this hurricane was. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=925.74s)]
*  And the Harris Biden administration says they don't have any money. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=927.82s)]
*  They've spent it all on. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=932.1400000000001s)]
*  They spent all of their money. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=934.5s)]
*  They have almost no money because they spent it all on illegal migrants. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=935.5s)]
*  This is the worst response in the history of hurricanes. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=939.82s)]
*  The president's right. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=945.62s)]
*  And sadly, tonight as we speak, Americans from North Carolina all the way down to Florida [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=946.76s)]
*  in the Southeast continue to suffer. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adk4dM4EBt0&t=951.54s)]
