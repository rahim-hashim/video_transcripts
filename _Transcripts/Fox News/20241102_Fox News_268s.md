# Sen. Ted Cruz: The extreme left ‘have lost their minds’
**Fox News:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE)
*  More, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, your reaction to all of this? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=1.6s)]
*  You know, it really is astonishing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=5.36s)]
*  Six days out, and the closing argument for Kamala Harris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=6.98s)]
*  is Donald Trump is a Nazi, and more than half of America [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=10.24s)]
*  are floating pieces of garbage. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=14.0s)]
*  Listen, this is what they believe. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=16.32s)]
*  This is what they think. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  As you laid out in your monologue, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=19.68s)]
*  there is a clear line from calling us garbage, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=22.0s)]
*  to Hillary Clinton calling us deplorables, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=25.04s)]
*  to Barack Obama saying we're bitter and angry [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=27.26s)]
*  and clinging to our God and our guns. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=30.020000000000003s)]
*  There is an elitist condescension. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=32.54s)]
*  There's a contempt. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=34.86s)]
*  And I gotta say, I think President Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=36.18s)]
*  put it beautifully, which is you can't lead America [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=37.54s)]
*  if you don't love Americans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=40.7s)]
*  And I think the radical left, they look down on us [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=42.02s)]
*  as a bunch of ignorant rubes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  It's why their strategy is based on lying to us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  And you just showed Tim Walz going, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=52.14s)]
*  well, we need to be unified. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=54.86s)]
*  You damn Nazis. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  That's a little out there, and yet that's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=57.9s)]
*  their closing message. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=60.5s)]
*  I'm laughing, but there's really nothing funny about it, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=63.62s)]
*  especially in an environment where we have had, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=66.02s)]
*  Donald Trump came within a millimeter of being assassinated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=69.82s)]
*  We had an assassin just a couple hundred yards away [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=72.97999999999999s)]
*  from Donald Trump with an AK-47 with a scope on it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=77.1s)]
*  They didn't even sweep the area known to hold paparazzi [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=80.5s)]
*  taking pictures of Donald Trump playing golf. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  It is beyond repulsive, but then they juxtapose it with, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=87.86s)]
*  oh no, we're the party of joy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=92.06s)]
*  You elect me president, I'm going to unite the country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=94.98s)]
*  whether you vote for me or not. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't sound like it to me, Senator. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=99.5s)]
*  I've covered a lot of campaigns in my day. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=101.66s)]
*  Look, listen, Trump derangement syndrome [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=104.3s)]
*  is a very real thing, and the extreme left, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=107.66s)]
*  they've lost their minds. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=109.94s)]
*  We see that with Joe Biden, who wants to lock Trump up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=111.06s)]
*  We see that with Kamala Harris, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=113.78s)]
*  and we see that with my opponent here in Texas, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=115.42s)]
*  Colin Allred, who is angry, who is hard left, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=117.66s)]
*  and yet Chuck Schumer has been explicit [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=120.94s)]
*  that I'm his number one target in the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=123.7s)]
*  I'll tell you every single day, Sean, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=125.34s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is putting millions and millions more dollars [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=127.62s)]
*  into my race in Texas, into attack ads in Texas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=130.86s)]
*  Just today, the news broke that this race in Texas [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=134.78s)]
*  is the single most expensive Senate race [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=137.66s)]
*  in the entire country, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=140.22s)]
*  and we've got over $100 million that is coming [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=141.94s)]
*  from Schumer and George Soros' relentless attack ads, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=144.82s)]
*  and so I'm so grateful to everyone who watches your show, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=148.1s)]
*  who's gone to TedCruz.org and is given, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=151.94s)]
*  and I would ask everyone, we're six days out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=154.82s)]
*  This is the absolute heat of the fight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=157.26s)]
*  Please, right now, go to TedCruz.org, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=159.9s)]
*  contribute 10, 25, 50, $100 or more. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=163.06s)]
*  Your going to TedCruz.org is literally the oxygen we need [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=166.5s)]
*  for the deluge that is coming from Schumer and Soros, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=170.74s)]
*  and it is the hatred, it is the derangement on the other side [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=174.18s)]
*  that is fueling the attacks on Trump [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  and that is fueling the attacks [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=179.9s)]
*  from Schumer and Soros on me as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=181.5s)]
*  Keeping people like you in the Senate, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=184.38s)]
*  adding people like Bernie Moreno in Ohio, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=186.34s)]
*  Mike Rogers in Michigan, Eric Hobbdy in Wisconsin [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  would be a great ad for Republicans, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=194.9s)]
*  We got great Senate candidates in Nevada, Arizona. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=197.06s)]
*  This could be, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  if you're going to vote for Donald Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=202.94s)]
*  and you want his agenda passed, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=204.22s)]
*  don't you need the biggest majority [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  you can have in the Senate? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=207.78s)]
*  And don't you need the biggest majority [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=208.94s)]
*  you can have in the House? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=210.38s)]
*  I hope people will take that into account [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=211.3s)]
*  as they go to the polls. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  You get the last word. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, look, you absolutely do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=217.62s)]
*  On the upside, I hope and pray Trump wins. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=219.58s)]
*  We get a Republican Senate, a Republican House. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll get big victories. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=224.38s)]
*  We'll secure the border. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=225.66000000000003s)]
*  We'll cut taxes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=227.58s)]
*  We'll end the war on oil and gas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll end the wars abroad. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  Israel will defeat Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  But I'll say on the flip side, if God forbid, Kamala wins, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=232.82000000000002s)]
*  I think it's likely the Democrats would also win the House. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=236.02s)]
*  And then the Senate is the last check and balance [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=238.9s)]
*  to stop this country from plunging over the cliff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=242.06s)]
*  The reason Schumer's coming after Texas [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=244.9s)]
*  is he sees Texas as how he stays majority leader. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=246.94s)]
*  So please come to TedCruz.org right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGWCqfOYJIE&t=249.62s)]
