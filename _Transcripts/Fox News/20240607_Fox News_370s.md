# Trump reveals when he could name VP
**Fox News:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE)
*  Now, part two of my interview with former President Donald Trump at Boralago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=0.0s)]
*  I asked him about his VP search. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=5.48s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you, where are you in the process of picking a vice president? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=8.6s)]
*  Because you're getting close. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=13.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, but I think I'll announce who that person's going to be during the convention. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=14.56s)]
*  I think that's pretty normal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=18.68s)]
*  During the convention, it will be an interesting period of time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=20.64s)]
*  Want to give me any names? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=23.32s)]
*  No, but you, look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=24.32s)]
*  You don't want to give me names? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=25.32s)]
*  We have a lot of good— [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=26.32s)]
*  I'd love for you to give me names. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=27.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=28.32s)]
*  But you'll be certainly maybe the first to know, you know, in all fairness. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=29.64s)]
*  We have some people that have done a fantastic job in communicating the ills and the assets [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=34.56s)]
*  and the advantages and the disadvantages of what we're doing as a country and where we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=42.64s)]
*  are as a country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=46.68s)]
*  How many people are in it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=47.68s)]
*  This is a very dangerous—Shon, this is a very dangerous time in America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=48.68s)]
*  We have a very corrupt system of politics like we've never had before. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=53.44s)]
*  We have to strengthen our elections and we have to strengthen our borders, and we've [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=58.64s)]
*  got to do something with our country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  Oh, we're not going to have a country left. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=65.28s)]
*  And you know, we're talking about other countries and respect. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=67.2s)]
*  They don't respect our president right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=70.2s)]
*  And unless our president is respected, we are in great—really grave danger. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=77.92s)]
*  You know, there is this issue of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and I assume he's going to be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=78.92s)]
*  in the ballot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=83.48s)]
*  I don't think a lot of conservatives have examined his record. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=85.36s)]
*  I'll scroll it now so I don't have to read it all. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  The NRA is a terrorist organization. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=92.64s)]
*  Hashtag keep it in the ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=94.92s)]
*  He doesn't want drilling. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=96.92s)]
*  He doesn't want fracking. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=98.56s)]
*  He doesn't want any energy independence at all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=100.12s)]
*  He has gone with everybody from Obama, every radical left-winger. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  And somehow they say that he's conservative. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  And I think it really has to do with one issue, his opposition to the shot or the COVID shot [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  or vaccinations. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Which, by the way, I watched him the other night on a show, and he said he had no opposition [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  to it all of a sudden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  But look, I know him well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  He's radical left. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=126.6s)]
*  His family is very radical left, and they hate him for doing what—because he's lying. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=127.72s)]
*  It's not like he grew up conservative. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=132.12s)]
*  He's very radical left. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=133.56s)]
*  He's hurt New England and he's hurt New York so badly because what they've done on energy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  is a disaster. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  Their energy is through the roof because he doesn't want any drilling. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=142.12s)]
*  He doesn't want any fracking. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=145.32s)]
*  He doesn't want anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=146.92s)]
*  No coal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=147.92s)]
*  He is a radical left guy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=148.92s)]
*  And because he came out at one point strongly against all vaccines—now, is he against [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  the polio vaccine? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Because polio was destroying the country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=157.32s)]
*  It was destroying the world. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=158.72s)]
*  Let me ask you about the demographic shift that keeps showing up in poll after poll after [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=159.72s)]
*  poll. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=165.16s)]
*  And you mentioned these demographics earlier. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=166.16s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=168.24s)]
*  That is a big part of the Democratic coalition. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  And you've heard people like James Carville, like really angry. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  And I've known James. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=177.8s)]
*  I've debated James over the years. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=179.28s)]
*  I like him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=181.08s)]
*  Crazy, but like him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=182.08s)]
*  And he's a smart guy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=184.84s)]
*  And people like David Axelrod and Van Jones and even Maureen Dowd, you know, powerful [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=186.96s)]
*  voices in the Democratic Party sensing that that coalition is crashing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=192.88s)]
*  I would argue that the radicalized party in the left today is nothing like the old Democratic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=199.88s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=205.44s)]
*  They've become the party of coastal elites. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=206.44s)]
*  And the Republican Party, especially under you, has become the party of hardworking Americans, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=208.68s)]
*  you know, rank and file. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=217.2s)]
*  When you went out and you met those construction workers during your trial, you know, USA, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  USA, that wouldn't have happened maybe years ago, that a Republican would get that response. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=226.76s)]
*  Or when you went to New Jersey, were you a little surprised by the size of that crowd? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  We had 107,000 people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=236.92s)]
*  It's the biggest crowd they've ever had in New Jersey. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=238.72s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  But black people, African American people, are streaming toward us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  I think one of the big reasons... [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=249.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  What's happened? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  Because they had the best economy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  We had the best economy, best job numbers, best everything during my presidency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  Also, I funded the historically black colleges and universities. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=257.12s)]
*  I funded them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=264.8s)]
*  They were coming to Washington every year, the presidents. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=266.2s)]
*  Every single year they were coming to Washington looking for money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=270.16s)]
*  One of them, and I became friendly with a lot of them, they run the black colleges and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=273.24s)]
*  universities, and they would ask, and I took care of them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=276.88s)]
*  I gave them long-term financing, much more money than they wanted, and they really like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=279.48s)]
*  me, I will tell you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=284.48s)]
*  They really like me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=285.6s)]
*  No Democrat did that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=286.96s)]
*  But when you look at the things I did, criminal justice reform, I got criminal justice reform. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=288.64s)]
*  Obama couldn't get it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=293.48s)]
*  Nobody could get it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=294.92s)]
*  I've done more for black people than anybody since Abraham Lincoln, and they understand [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=296.48s)]
*  it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=301.12s)]
*  They really understand it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=302.12s)]
*  And they also had the best job numbers they've ever had. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=303.12s)]
*  They had the best job numbers they've ever had during the Trump administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=304.88s)]
*  Let me ask you a couple of things. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=309.32s)]
*  Merrick Garland- [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=310.52s)]
*  That goes, by the way, for Hispanics also. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=311.52s)]
*  Hispanics, I think I'm above 50 percent. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  This is, you know, to somebody watching that say, well, what's so good about 50 percent? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=317.36s)]
*  Republicans are down at 8 and 9 percent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=321.76s)]
*  I think I'm going to maybe win the Hispanic population. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=323.76s)]
*  We had a poll out today that African American, 32 percent for Trump, 32 percent. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=327.4s)]
*  But my company got like 4 percent. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=334.36s)]
*  I think I'm at 32 percent. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=336.56s)]
*  And I think it's going to grow. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=339.32s)]
*  Look, Biden is a stiff. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  You talk to him, you look at him. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=342.88s)]
*  These are smart people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanics, they're smart people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=346.92s)]
*  They've gone through a lot. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=349.68s)]
*  They look at this guy, and he doesn't know where the hell he is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=351.12s)]
*  He doesn't know he's alive. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's very hard for them to vote for him. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n2O9YlU9QE&t=355.92s)]
