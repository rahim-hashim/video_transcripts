# JD Vance: These ideas will destroy western civilization
**Fox News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA)
*  We continue tonight from Washington DC. Here is part two of my exclusive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=0.0s)]
*  interview with the Vice President JD Vance. Every time he talks about terrorists [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=5.28s)]
*  I'm like is the media and Democrats that ignorant? Have you not figured out that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=10.24s)]
*  means oh let's negotiate. Exactly. And they seem not to want to understand that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=14.68s)]
*  part of them. You said at the Munich Security Conference and I want to quote [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=18.6s)]
*  it directly, biggest threat to Europe is not Russia or China. You talked about the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  retreat of Europe from fundamental values. The threat is from within. Yes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=28.92s)]
*  And you went on to talk about digital censorship and canceling [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=35.28s)]
*  elections. That was a powerful condemnation of what is really happening [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=39.84s)]
*  there. I appreciate it and it's also by the way Sean a condemnation of what the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=44.92s)]
*  Biden administration was doing. This is one of the things that I think the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=48.56s)]
*  Europeans didn't appreciate about the speeches. The biggest driver of mass [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=51.64s)]
*  censorship in the last five years, it actually wasn't the Europeans. They were [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=56.48s)]
*  the victims of it in a lot of ways. It was coming from the Biden administration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  This whole crazy left-wing idea that we're not allowed to debate ideas, that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=65.2s)]
*  we're not allowed to discuss things, that we have to silence people, censor them, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=70.52s)]
*  throw them in jail for silently praying outside of an abortion clinic. These [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=74.4s)]
*  ideas are going to destroy Western civilization. They're going to destroy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=78.8s)]
*  Europe and they would destroy the United States of America if we allowed them to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=82.4s)]
*  fester. Thank God we have a president now who believes in free speech but the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=86.24s)]
*  danger is still there. The danger is there in Europe. The danger is there in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=90.52s)]
*  the United States of America. We have to ask ourselves the questions as leaders. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=94.28s)]
*  Are we willing to defend people even if we disagree with what they say? If you're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=97.52s)]
*  not willing to do that, I don't think you're fit to lead Europe or the United [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=102.28s)]
*  States of America. If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=105.88s)]
*  Exactly right. You said it at the same conference. Exactly right. There's nothing that we can do [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=111.44s)]
*  for you if you're terrified of your own people. And Sean, you see this every [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=114.8s)]
*  single day. What are some of the biggest drivers of violence in these European [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=118.12s)]
*  societies? It's mass migration. It's people who haven't assimilated into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=121.84s)]
*  European societies, who are driving cars into Christmas festivals, killing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=126.84s)]
*  tons of innocent people. And very often the European response to that is not to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=131.76s)]
*  say, oh well maybe we should get control of our own borders. The response is to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=136.56s)]
*  try to silence and shut down their own citizenry. That is a danger in Europe. It [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=140.52s)]
*  was a danger under Joe Biden in the United States of America. And look, of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=145.08s)]
*  course, China is a major threat. It's a major competitor over the next few [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=148.72s)]
*  years, over the next few decades. But I have no doubt that America and Europe [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=153.44s)]
*  could take on whatever threats so long as we're strong internally. That's the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=158.24s)]
*  biggest risk to our civilization. It's that weakness internally. That's what we [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=163.0s)]
*  have to fix. The Democratic Party now, they want long protracted wars. The [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=167.08s)]
*  Democratic Party championing men to play in women's sports. The Democratic Party [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  putting the rights of the illegals over the safety of Americans and defending [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=175.96s)]
*  what will be hundreds of trillions of dollars in waste, fraud, abuse, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  corruption. How does that end for them? I think it ends very, very poorly. And the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=183.88000000000002s)]
*  American people are a lot smarter than the Democrats give them credit for. You [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=187.44s)]
*  cannot shut up your fellow citizens, force biological men to play in sports [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=191.52s)]
*  with girls, which by the way, it's just insulting to the girls. It's actually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  dangerous. Title IX, some of these sports are very violent. You don't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  want to have biological men against women. It's crazy. And the Democrats, again, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=206.24s)]
*  there's this crazy idea in the Democratic Party that if you just repeat [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=210.8s)]
*  insane ideas, eventually the American people are going to believe them. We [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  actually think the American people are smart and we should listen to them [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=219.08s)]
*  rather than preach at them. And I think that's the core right now of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=222.52s)]
*  president's political strength. Last question. Tomorrow you'll be sitting in a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  very prominent seat. Are you excited about your seating chart for the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  State of the Union? I'm excited about the speech. It's going to be a little [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  unusual to have the camera on me for, you know, an hour and a half and every [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=239.0s)]
*  reaction that I have. But I think, you know, the thing that I've learned, Sean, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=243.0s)]
*  is people always say when you're on camera, you know, try to try to be stoic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=247.32s)]
*  and try not to show your cards. I'm going to have fun tomorrow because the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=252.0s)]
*  president United States, he's going to make a lot of good arguments. He's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=256.04s)]
*  going to talk a lot about a lot of the successes that we've had in these first [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=259.0s)]
*  45 days. He's also going to be himself, which means he's going to poke a little [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=262.86s)]
*  fun and we're going to have a good time tomorrow. So I'm just going to try to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=267.08s)]
*  enjoy it. Well, it seems like when I first interviewed you, it seems like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=270.0s)]
*  it's sunk in. You now know you're the vice president. You're like, okay, this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=273.2s)]
*  is a little new. But Mr. Vice President, you're always generous with your time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=277.0s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HR4d1ZAcA&t=280.28s)]
