# GOP lawmaker and Teamsters president reveal how Trump brought them together after feud
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8)
*  All right, it is no secret that congressional hearings can get heated at times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the way the games played. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=6.2s)]
*  But there was one hearing battle that topped them all, one that almost became, well, violent. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=7.5s)]
*  It certainly was epic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=12.84s)]
*  Right then and there was Oklahoma Senator Mark Wayne Mullen versus Teamsters General [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=14.72s)]
*  President Sean O'Brien. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=18.56s)]
*  Here's a reminder of what happened. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=20.04s)]
*  This is back in 23. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=21.28s)]
*  He said to me one, two, three, four, five times, and let me read what the last one said, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=23.84s)]
*  said, greedy CEO who pretends like he's self-made. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=32.6s)]
*  Sir, I wish he was in the truck with me when I was building my plumbing company myself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=36.88s)]
*  Quit the tough guy act and these Senate hearings. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  You know where to find me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=45.16s)]
*  Any place, any time, cowboy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=46.8s)]
*  Sir, this is a time, this is a place. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=50.16s)]
*  You want to run your mouth. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=53.2s)]
*  We can be two consenting adults. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  We can finish it here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=55.6s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=56.6s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=57.6s)]
*  You want to do it now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=58.6s)]
*  I'd love to do it right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=59.6s)]
*  Well, stand your butt up then. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=60.6s)]
*  You stand your butt up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=61.6s)]
*  Oh, hold on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=62.6s)]
*  Oh, stop it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=63.6s)]
*  Is that your solution to every problem? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=64.6s)]
*  Oh, no, sit down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=65.6s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=66.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=67.6s)]
*  You know, you're a United States Senator. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=68.6s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=69.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=70.6s)]
*  Sit down, please. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=71.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=72.6s)]
*  And while they almost came to blows, the two men now are ready to bury the hatchet saying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=74.4s)]
*  President Trump has brought them together. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=78.68s)]
*  I'm going to turn it over to you right now to explain more. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=81.0s)]
*  Oklahoma Senator Mark Wayne Mullen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think I want to mess with—he's got some serious octagon time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  And also with us, Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm glad you two are together, but we don't need to go back and live the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  past. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=95.36s)]
*  But, Sean, you know, my mom was a prison guard. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=96.36s)]
*  My dad was a probation officer and a waiter on weekends. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  I worked from the time I was eight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=102.6s)]
*  I was 12 years old washing dishes every Friday, Saturday, Sunday night till 2 in the morning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Busboy, waiter, bartender. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=110.12s)]
*  That was 10 years of my life, 10 years in construction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=111.12s)]
*  If you think I'm against working men and women, I'm a no-tax-on-tips, overtime or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  Social Security guy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=119.76s)]
*  That's great. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, and listen, I think everybody's embraced the American worker. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=123.12s)]
*  I think—look, the Senate and I have put our differences together. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  We agree on what we can agree on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=131.52s)]
*  There's going to be disagreement. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=133.36s)]
*  And that's the beauty about having dialogue and conversations, that, you know, we can [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=134.96s)]
*  maybe come to terms and conditions that work for both people, both sides. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=139.28s)]
*  And I think right now it's crazy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=144.68s)]
*  I mean, you know, the Senator and I have endorsed former Congresswoman Lorie Chavez [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=146.84s)]
*  de Rima, and we are working very hard, both of us, to do what's right for the American [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=153.56s)]
*  worker. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=158.72s)]
*  Now, we can agree to disagree on rights of work. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=159.72s)]
*  We can agree to disagree on the PRO Act. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=161.56s)]
*  But the task at hand right now is getting Lorie Chavez de Rima confirmed, and we're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=163.92s)]
*  going to work together. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=168.44s)]
*  And look, we did have a fight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=169.44s)]
*  We did have an argument. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=171.04s)]
*  But it is what it is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=172.3s)]
*  It's in the past. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=173.3s)]
*  And, you know, I'm from Boston, man. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=174.3s)]
*  I played hockey. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=175.3s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=176.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, I was going to give him the Matthew Kachuck, the jersey over the head and just [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=177.3s)]
*  start throwing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=179.88s)]
*  But, you know, he's a big, strong, tough guy, and he's, you know, he's passionate about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=180.88s)]
*  what he does, and I'm passionate about what I do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=185.8s)]
*  Senator, I'm glad you guys have buried the hatchet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=188.24s)]
*  More importantly, I'm glad you're working together. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=191.0s)]
*  I want the Republican Party to forever be the party of working men and women, people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=192.92s)]
*  like my parents and my grandparents and me in my early years in life. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=199.04s)]
*  It's the best thing that ever happened in my life, working hard. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I totally agree. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, I grew up, obviously, in a plumbing truck and have been blessed to have a tremendous [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  amount of workforce of employees doing HVAC electrical and plumbing work for me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=216.76s)]
*  And I couldn't agree with you more, but what this represents, what Sean and I's friendship [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=222.16s)]
*  represents is President Trump reaching out outside the norm of the political boundaries [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=225.72s)]
*  that the Republican Party had put on ourselves and brought a coalition together, like with [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=231.92s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, with Bobby. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=235.88s)]
*  And even after President Trump and Sean O'Brien sat down and talked, one of the first phone [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=238.28s)]
*  calls he made was to me and said, hey, Mark, I think you guys will get along. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  I think we got a place for the unions to come in, and it starts with Sean. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Why don't you guys just sit down and break bread together? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  Sean and I broke bread together the first time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=257.68s)]
*  We have truly built a friendship ever since then. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's about setting our differences aside and looking at what we have in common. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=263.2s)]
*  And when we can get past those differences and we look at, hey, we're still all in this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  same together. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  We're on the same boat. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  We're on the same direction, and that's to build a future for the employees that help [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=274.16s)]
*  build the company. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=278.6s)]
*  But at the same time, the employees don't have a job if the company doesn't exist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=279.6s)]
*  So we've all got to work together in that matter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=283.32s)]
*  I want to have you guys back for a longer segment, because this is too important. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  And I hope one of the models that comes out of this is that companies let workers enjoy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=288.88s)]
*  in the profits, so they're all pulling in the same direction, and they all have skin [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  in the game. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=300.48s)]
*  Guys, thank you both. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=301.48s)]
*  More Hannity straight ahead. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=302.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bssVdLWmbY8&t=304.04s)]
