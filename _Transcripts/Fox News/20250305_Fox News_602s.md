# Hannity: Democrats showed their ‘true colors’
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc)
*  But first, after last night's reprehensible behavior in the House chamber, one thing is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=0.0s)]
*  very clear. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=5.28s)]
*  The Democratic Party, they are a soulless, heartless party. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=6.28s)]
*  And right now, they are a party with no message, frankly no morals, after what I saw last night, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=11.32s)]
*  no leadership, no soul, and no vision, as they stubbornly cling to their irrational [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=16.6s)]
*  hatred and rage and radicalism. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=22.8s)]
*  They showed the country yet once again just how truly out of touch they are with everyday [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=25.46s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=30.82s)]
*  They repeatedly acted like petulant children. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=31.82s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Al Green even had him, you know, himself thrown out of the House [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=35.06s)]
*  chamber for that outburst, before, of course, announcing he was working on articles of impeachment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Here we go again, as if this wasn't predictable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=46.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=48.7s)]
*  Health care has become wealth care for many people, and we can't afford to let that happen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=49.7s)]
*  Is that the only thing that you're protesting? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=54.1s)]
*  No, I have other things I'm protesting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=55.78s)]
*  And I'm also working on my articles of impeachment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=58.5s)]
*  This president is unfit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  He should not hold the office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=63.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=66.14s)]
*  He is unfit for the office. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=67.14s)]
*  That means Green. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=68.14s)]
*  Anyway, his little temper tantrum did not go over well with you, the American people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=69.14s)]
*  Even Fake News CNN had a poll. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=73.22s)]
*  Eighty percent of viewers there found his behavior to be inappropriate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  According to the same CNN poll, nearly 70 percent of the people that watched approve [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=79.18s)]
*  of what President Trump said, while a CBS poll was even better for the president, revealing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=84.34s)]
*  76 percent of Americans approved of this address. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  And when you dive deep into the issues, it gets even better for President Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=93.26s)]
*  Seventy-seven percent of people that watched the speech approved of President Trump's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=97.7s)]
*  plans for addressing waste, fraud, abuse and corruption in government spending. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=102.54s)]
*  Seventy-seven percent approved of his plans for immigration and the border. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=107.9s)]
*  Seventy-three percent approved of his plans for Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=111.86s)]
*  Sixty-five percent approved of his plans on tariffs, which are reciprocal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  But the Democrats, their unhinged behavior, it started before President Trump even began [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  his speech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=124.98s)]
*  Earlier in the day, a truly bizarre, strange, awkward display of dozens of prominent Democrats, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=125.98s)]
*  simultaneously, seemingly, posting a video on social media attacking the president while [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=133.74s)]
*  using the exact same format, the exact same script. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=140.3s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=144.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=145.62s)]
*  You really can't make this up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=164.62s)]
*  Contrary to what the Democrats said, President Trump delivered an incredibly powerful, uplifting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=170.22s)]
*  speech, highlighting his policies that will make our country stronger while celebrating [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=175.18s)]
*  everyday Americans with very heartwarming stories. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=180.66000000000003s)]
*  But still, the Democrats, they couldn't even bring themselves to applaud or stand for any [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  They couldn't bring themselves to stand for Alexis Nungary, whose 12-year-old daughter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=190.78s)]
*  was brutally murdered by two unvetted Biden-Harris illegals. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  They didn't stand when President Trump honored Lakin Riley and her family, another young [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  woman murdered at the hands of Biden-Harris unvetted illegals, her poor mother fighting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=205.2s)]
*  back tears before the entire country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=211.82s)]
*  They refused to applaud a young man who lost his father and now is able to fulfill his [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=214.44s)]
*  dream. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=220.18s)]
*  He found out last night he was accepted to West Point, couldn't stand for that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=221.18s)]
*  They stayed seated when the president honored the life of officer, slain officer Jonathan [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  Diller. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=231.5s)]
*  He was killed in the line of duty in New York City. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=232.5s)]
*  That's his young wife on the screen there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=235.1s)]
*  They didn't stand when the president honored Corey Campator, who sacrificed his life to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  protect his family during the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=244.02s)]
*  They refused to applaud Mark Fogel, his 95-year-old mother, who he was held hostage. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=248.46s)]
*  President Trump made a promise he would bring her son home and held hostage in Russia until [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=254.94s)]
*  Trump secured his release, something Biden was unable, incapable of doing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=260.42s)]
*  And maybe worst of all, they stayed seated and silent when a brave 13-year-old boy who [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=265.06s)]
*  beat cancer, had been battling cancer since he was eight, whose life's dream it was to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=270.38s)]
*  was made an honorary member of the Secret Service by Sean Curran, the new leader of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=276.18s)]
*  the Secret Service. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=281.66s)]
*  At one point, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell even appeared, look at that, to roll [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=282.98s)]
*  her eyes while the president honored him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=288.42s)]
*  This is your modern day. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=291.4s)]
*  Take a good look. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  This is your modern day radicalized, soulless Democratic party. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=294.02s)]
*  They hate Donald Trump so much that you couldn't show compassion for mothers that lost their [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=300.74s)]
*  children because of illegal immigrants or a child that beat brain cancer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=306.82s)]
*  And now, what are we looking at as a country? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=313.3s)]
*  A party that is defeated, a party that is dead, a party that is heartless and a party [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=316.02s)]
*  that is soulless. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=321.06s)]
*  They represent everything that is radical and extreme. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=322.3s)]
*  They stood up in unison earlier this week for the right of men to play women's sports, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=326.06s)]
*  but they can't be bothered for loved ones who lost family members. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=330.7s)]
*  Now, in fairness, they did eventually find one thing to stand and clap for last night. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=334.46s)]
*  More. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=339.38s)]
*  Hunt, we've already spent hundreds of billions. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=340.38s)]
*  They want more billions for the war in Ukraine and endless wars to continue. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=341.94s)]
*  Take a look at this moment between President Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who he affectionately [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=347.44s)]
*  calls Pocahontas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=352.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=353.14s)]
*  The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense with [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=355.02s)]
*  no security, with no anything. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=363.46s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=380.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=382.62s)]
*  Yeah, you would say Pocahontas says yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=384.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=398.1s)]
*  You're going to oppose the end of death and destruction and an attempt at peace in Europe, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=399.1s)]
*  peace in the Middle East? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=403.7s)]
*  That's soulless. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=404.7s)]
*  That's what I mean when I say soulless, heartless, mean-spirited, out of touch, and they showed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=405.7s)]
*  their true colors last night. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=409.94s)]
*  And their behavior was so despicable, even some members of the liberal media, legacy [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=412.5s)]
*  media mob, are agreeing with me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=416.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=418.98s)]
*  What we saw in the theatrics tonight in the chamber are not being well received. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=419.98s)]
*  The Democrats came ready to fight back with their little paddles, okay? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=424.54s)]
*  That is how you save democracy, by quietly dissenting or bidding on an antique tea set. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=430.22s)]
*  It was hard to tell what was going on. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=436.9s)]
*  I will say, I thought Democrat—I thought that was—I think there were times when they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=438.66s)]
*  should have risen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  I think what Al Green did was despicable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  How they going to stash it back, Michael, when they holding up bingo or auction signs? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  I was going to say, well, thank you, Simone. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  I just—can we talk about it? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  The bingo signs were killing me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  I don't know who thought up the bingo signs, but they should be fired. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=454.38000000000005s)]
*  Michael, this is an indictment, in my opinion, on the Democratic leadership. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=457.94000000000005s)]
*  Now, while some in the media acknowledge the disaster that unfolded for Democrats, others [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  over at MSDNC, they chose to hit another new low, mocking the ceremony that honored this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=467.82s)]
*  young child that beat cancer. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=473.94s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=476.22s)]
*  Just take this in. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=478.22s)]
*  For the record—and this is disgusting—the president made a spectacle out of praising [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=481.22s)]
*  a young man who thus far survived pediatric cancer, as if the president had something [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=488.22s)]
*  to do with that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=495.26s)]
*  The president, in the midst of him praising Doge, Doge Cuts, among other things, have [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=496.78s)]
*  cut off funding for ongoing research into pediatric cancer. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgdirdxFIc&t=501.34s)]
