# Kellyanne Conway: Illegal immigrants are rewarded for breaking the law
**Fox News:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw)
*  Now, we have reminded you that Joe Biden, the vice president, Alejandro Mayorkas and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre encircled by Jen Psaki. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=8.08s)]
*  They all lied. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=10.52s)]
*  They all said the border is secure, the border is closed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=11.52s)]
*  Well, now the border crisis is top of mind for most Americans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=14.08s)]
*  Look at this from Gallup. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=17.64s)]
*  They asked 1,000 U.S. adults, unprompted, to name the biggest problem facing the country, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=19.02s)]
*  again, off the top of their heads. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=25.12s)]
*  More of them said illegal immigration than anything else. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=27.4s)]
*  There's a reason for that concern. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=30.2s)]
*  Here's what one general just said about the continuing terror threat from ISIS, which [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=32.32s)]
*  can easily exploit Joe's wide-open borders with unvetted illegals coming, oh, from even [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=38.44s)]
*  our top geopolitical foes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=44.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=46.62s)]
*  ISIS-K in particular, but ISIS in general, has a strong desire to attack our homeland. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=47.62s)]
*  We should believe them when they say that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=54.56s)]
*  They're going to try to do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=57.28s)]
*  And so I think the threat is growing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=58.28s)]
*  It's begun to grow as soon as we left Afghanistan and took pressure off ISIS-K. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=61.52s)]
*  So I think we should expect further attempts of this nature against the United States, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=66.4s)]
*  as well as our partners and other nations abroad. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=70.76s)]
*  I think this is inevitable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  And FBI Director Wray in the last two congressional appearances has been echoing that threat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=74.92s)]
*  It's never been this bad or this loud in his career. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=79.48s)]
*  It's not just the threat of terrorism causing concern. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=83.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  ICE announced in their latest annual report—remember, the government doesn't keep statistics on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  violent crimes of illegals, but they point out they arrested illegals in this country [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  who committed nearly 50,000 violent crimes, everything to murder, from murder to kidnapping, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=97.56s)]
*  assault and much more. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=103.68s)]
*  One illegal, by the way, in the state of Alabama now stands accused of raping a disabled 14-year-old [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=105.12s)]
*  girl. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=111.2s)]
*  Biden, his Democratic pals, they're all in on enabling the crisis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=112.72s)]
*  In the state of Massachusetts, a former soldier's home is now being turned into a so-called [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=116.8s)]
*  emergency shelter for illegals. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=122.12s)]
*  And while so-called asylum seekers, they get free housing there, they're also getting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  a free ride from a local judge in Texas who just yesterday said a bunch of the illegal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=130.34s)]
*  immigrants—remember the ones rushing the border in front of the Texas National Guard? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah, they've all been set free in El Paso. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=143.04s)]
*  And by the way, none of this shows any sign of slowing down, because Mexico is too busy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=145.72s)]
*  not helping us lecturing America, the Mexican president, on 60 Minutes adamantly and apparently [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=152.12s)]
*  now trying to extort our country into paying what is billions and billions of dollars and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=158.52s)]
*  changing our policy to countries like Cuba and Venezuela. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=164.0s)]
*  By the way, here's how former President Trump responded to the Mexico president's threat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=168.76s)]
*  In 60 Minutes, the president of Mexico says, we're not going to shut down our border until [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=172.76s)]
*  you change your policy on Cuba and change your policy on Venezuela. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=177.44s)]
*  Is it okay for the Mexican president to dictate American policy? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=181.72s)]
*  He said he wants $10 billion essentially just to talk. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=184.44s)]
*  $10 billion to talk. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=187.44s)]
*  And that's come out since. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=189.56s)]
*  And, no, that wouldn't happen with me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=190.56s)]
*  They would never say that to me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=192.36s)]
*  They would never say—before we even took—they want $10 billion a year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=193.52s)]
*  Mexico just asked for $10 billion a year. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  They would never ask—I wouldn't give them 10 cents. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=200.52s)]
*  They know that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  Here with Reaction, Fox News contributors Ari Fleischer and Kellyanne Conway. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  All right, Kellyanne Conway, so if we look at it, we've got, let's see, nearly 50,000 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=208.56s)]
*  Joe Biden unvetted illegals arrested for homicide, rape, kidnapping, violent assault. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=213.8s)]
*  And we're getting lectured by Mexico on what our Cuba policy, Venezuela policy ought to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  be, and, oh, they want tens of billions of our tax dollars. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=225.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=229.84s)]
*  Would that happen under Trump? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=230.84s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=232.32s)]
*  No, and we have proof for that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=233.32s)]
*  It didn't happen under Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=236.48s)]
*  Every time I hear, oh, if Donald Trump were the president, this may not have happened, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=237.8s)]
*  I say, well, let's roll the tape. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=241.12s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=242.52s)]
*  In fact, Sean, Ari, we're in our ninth year now of Donald Trump having elevated into the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=243.52s)]
*  national consciousness and to the top of the polls now border security and immigration. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=248.68s)]
*  And he did it to international criticism, if not ridicule. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=254.48s)]
*  And look where we are now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=258.64s)]
*  According to the A-people, 73 percent of Hispanics disapprove of the job Joe Biden has done on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=259.64s)]
*  the border, 55 percent of black Americans, and in fact, four in 10 Democrats. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=266.08s)]
*  You now have many of his own constituency saying, you're doing a terrible job on the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=271.4s)]
*  border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=275.48s)]
*  Here's what I don't understand. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=276.48s)]
*  If the American people tell you what's important to them, what's vexing and perplexing them, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=277.48s)]
*  and they're giving you a clear roadmap, respond to them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=282.36s)]
*  This administration has done the opposite. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=285.24s)]
*  They want to tell us all that what we see with our own two eyes, day after day, night [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  after night, isn't real. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=292.6s)]
*  It's not important. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=294.2s)]
*  It's some vast right-wing conspiracy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=295.2s)]
*  Also, the border has become a proxy for so many Americans, for a president that doesn't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=298.16s)]
*  listen, for a Democratic party that doesn't care, for a system that rewards those who [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=304.2s)]
*  take it easy and punishes those who work hard. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=310.96s)]
*  When you come here illegally, not only are you not prosecuted for breaking the law, now [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  you're actually rewarded. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=319.24s)]
*  You get cash and cell phones and shelter and clothing, and this is what Americans see now, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  and they don't want it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's get your take, Ari Fleischer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=329.08s)]
*  Well, there's no question this is Joe Biden's gigantic Achilles heel, and he's the one who [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=331.08s)]
*  loves to show it to us because he caused this problem. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=338.12s)]
*  During the debates, Joe Biden said, come, when he was asked what his message is to people [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  who are trying to come to America illegally. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=346.8s)]
*  He said, come. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=348.28s)]
*  He raised his hand when he was asked if he would support decriminalizing people who come [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=349.32s)]
*  into America illegally. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=353.88s)]
*  This is a crisis of his own creation, of his own wanting, because the end game for the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=355.82s)]
*  Democrats, Sean, is to let people come in illegally, get them work papers, which leads [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=360.28s)]
*  to green cards, which leads to voting. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=365.12s)]
*  Already in many municipalities, illegal immigrants, if they have a green card, they're not American [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=367.84s)]
*  citizens, can vote in American elections. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  Tell me how a municipality can keep that separate from a federal election. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=376.4s)]
*  This is their end game. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=380.64s)]
*  It also helps them with reapportionment, because this one New York City congresswoman said [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=381.76s)]
*  she needs the illegals in her district because that's how she gets her job as a congresswoman, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=387.12s)]
*  because she needs that number in her district. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  New York, otherwise, is losing seats. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=394.44s)]
*  So this is part of a political end game for the Democrats to hold power. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=397.72s)]
*  And that's why it sits so wrong with the American people who are fundamentally guided by right [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=402.12s)]
*  and wrong and by respect for the law. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=407.48s)]
*  And when there's want and disrespect for the law from the commander in chief, yeah, it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=409.8s)]
*  hurts the president. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=414.24s)]
*  And that's what's happening to Joe Biden. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  Americans take a good look at what Joe Biden has created here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=417.8s)]
*  Look at the no bail laws and defund, dismantle, reimagine the police. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=421.96s)]
*  How's that working out? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=427.68s)]
*  How's the economy working out? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=428.88s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=430.68s)]
*  Well, in 217 days, this country is at an inflection point. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=433.08s)]
*  It matters. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9UP9jsQQiw&t=436.8s)]
