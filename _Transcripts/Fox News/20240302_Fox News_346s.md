# Jonathan Turley: Hunter Biden 'confirmed essential elements' of House GOP allegations
**Fox News:** [March 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII)
*  Also tonight, a huge day in the Trump legal saga. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, President Trump appeared in a Florida courtroom for a hearing over the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  trial date in his classified documents case. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Now, yesterday, the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, proposed the start date of July the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=10.52s)]
*  8th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=15.44s)]
*  By the way, it's the same month of the RNC convention. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=16.44s)]
*  Today, Judge Cannon in Florida cast doubt on this timeline, saying it would compress [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=18.92s)]
*  a lot of pretrial arguments and deliberations into a very short window. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=24.44s)]
*  And earlier today, lawyers delivered closing arguments in the hearing over Fannie Willis [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=29.72s)]
*  and her alleged misconduct and whether or not she will be removed from this case. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=34.92s)]
*  At the conclusion of the arguments today, the judge announced that he would issue his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=40.08s)]
*  decision within the next two weeks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=44.2s)]
*  Here with reaction to all of this is Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=46.08s)]
*  Not sure where you want to start. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=50.92s)]
*  You know, you did write a great column. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  One liar, meaning the FBI's, as Christopher Wray said, one of the longest, most trusted [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=54.92s)]
*  informants, paid informants they've had ever, just like Christopher Steele turns out not [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=60.92s)]
*  to be the case. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=67.2s)]
*  That does not negate everything we just discussed with James Comer and with John Solomon, does [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=68.52s)]
*  it? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=73.76s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=74.76s)]
*  And what Hunter Biden did is he confirmed the essential elements of what has been alleged [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=75.76s)]
*  by these committees that they received a great deal of money from Russia, from China, from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=81.48s)]
*  Ukraine, and at least forty thousand dollars of Chinese money made it into the account [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=86.64s)]
*  of President Biden. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=93.52s)]
*  Now, this is the same person who said that his son didn't make any money in China. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=95.12s)]
*  It turns out he not only made money, but President Biden received some of that money. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  He also confirms other aspects of this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=105.16s)]
*  What he keeps on saying is a mantra is that all of this was perfectly legal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=107.96s)]
*  He adds that it's perfectly ethical, which is really something that left many of us dumbfounded. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=113.08s)]
*  You know, you can say that influence peddling can be done legally, but no one argues it's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=120.28s)]
*  done ethically. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  It is corrupt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=128.32s)]
*  The U.S. government has pushed treaty obligations to ban influence peddling because it views [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  it as one of the great forms of corruption. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  It has always been viewed as corruption. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  Now, what we now know is that the president was involved and was confirmed by Hunter Biden [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=141.66s)]
*  as involved in a great number of these meals, these dinners, these meetings. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=147.42s)]
*  He was clearly aware of his son's dealings with foreign governments. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=152.76s)]
*  He lied during the campaign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=157.5s)]
*  But more importantly, he had to be aware that his son was influence peddling. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=159.82s)]
*  It was being covered in some of the media. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=164.3s)]
*  We have a tape recording on the laptop from President Biden dealing with a New York Times [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  article that deals with his foreign dealings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=173.22s)]
*  So the statement of the president is manifestly false. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of this confirmed that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  So the question is, what do we do about that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=185.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=189.9s)]
*  I was very hopeful. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very important that the Supreme Court took up the immunity issue, and I'm [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=193.28s)]
*  glad that they did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=197.52s)]
*  To me, it's of great consequence in terms of the court and presidential, obviously, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=199.2s)]
*  immunity in this case. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=207.32s)]
*  I think that's an important issue for the country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=208.32s)]
*  Then you had Fonny Willis and wrapping up closing arguments today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to get your take on both of them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=214.56s)]
*  Do you think any of these cases, maybe except for the Bragg case that I'm not even sure [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=216.48s)]
*  with the charging Donald Trump with in New York, even at this late date, do you think [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=221.44s)]
*  any of these cases see the light of day before Election Day? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=226.02s)]
*  Well, today, the Trump campaign argued that the Florida trial should start after the election, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=229.76s)]
*  but agreed that August would be a doable date for them to do that trial. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  As for the D.C. trial with Smith, that's becoming less and less likely due to the need to review [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=243.32s)]
*  the immunity question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=250.74s)]
*  The court is expediting that question, but the court didn't create this conflict. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=252.38s)]
*  The court didn't put this close to an election. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=257.02s)]
*  Trump is being tried on conduct that occurred almost four years ago. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=260.06s)]
*  He didn't set that schedule. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=264.26s)]
*  So the court is going to try to get it right as opposed to just getting it rapidly done, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=266.5s)]
*  but it is expediting that schedule. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=272.02s)]
*  When it comes to Fonny Willis, it's anyone's guess what this... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=275.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=278.9s)]
*  Yeah, but arguments wouldn't be heard until late April. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=279.94s)]
*  Probably, you know, we won't hear their decision until June or maybe even late June. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=282.34s)]
*  And then what? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  They're going to have a trial the week of the Republican National Convention? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=288.73999999999995s)]
*  Either the Florida trial or D.C. trial? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=293.14s)]
*  I think that the D.C. judge should give up the ghost here and just say, look, let's stop [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=297.62s)]
*  trying to shoehorn this in before the election. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=302.17999999999995s)]
*  It's just too close to the election, and the public will have to render its own verdict. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=305.82s)]
*  Yeah, and what about Fonny Willis last word? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=310.38s)]
*  Well, they did a terrible job in defense of her office today. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=314.18s)]
*  This judge has grounds, in my view, to disqualify one or both of them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=319.78s)]
*  But it's a tough question for him, and I think the judge was being fair today to both sides. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=324.3s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  It's going to get interesting, that's for sure. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=332.3s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=333.5s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=334.5s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPV_XX8eII&t=335.5s)]
