# 'MAGA is what we will actually accomplish,' Speaker Mike Johnson says
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA)
*  But after the past, you know, 10 years, I think it's safe to say that there's no [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=0.0s)]
*  shortage of idiots doubling down on stupid in the media mob. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=4.32s)]
*  But their influence and their power is waning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=8.98s)]
*  And all of you know it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  And they want this Congress to enact Trump's America's First Agenda. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=13.64s)]
*  And tonight, I am joined by the people that will make that happen, many of the lawmakers [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=17.8s)]
*  responsible for getting this agenda across the finish line to help improve your lives, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=22.98s)]
*  make your towns, your cities more safe, more secure, and to put more money in your family's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=29.16s)]
*  pocket and make us the richest country on earth with energy, along with their leader, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=34.2s)]
*  Speaker of the House. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=40.44s)]
*  Let's give a warm congressional welcome to your speaker, Mike Johnson. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=41.44s)]
*  Great to see you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=44.44s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=45.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=46.44s)]
*  Great to see you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=47.96s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=48.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=49.96s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  When I walked in the room, I did not get that reception. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=60.72s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=63.72s)]
*  I'm glad everybody came tonight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=64.8s)]
*  I'm very grateful, actually, because I'm really here with one message. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  And I know you know what the message is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=71.52s)]
*  But I think it's clear. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=74.4s)]
*  You have a razor-thin majority. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=75.72s)]
*  I know you'll go up to five, which is still very thin. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=78.8s)]
*  And we have a lot of problems in this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=83.36s)]
*  Can you get this caucus, the varying factions, the study group, the Saturday group, the Sunday [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=87.04s)]
*  group, the Freedom Caucus, all of them, to understand that they have to work together? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=93.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=99.8s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=100.8s)]
*  Welcome back to Capitol Hill. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=101.8s)]
*  We're glad to have you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=102.8s)]
*  I did get a rousing applause when he walked in the room tonight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  We assembled top leaders in the House to show you that we are unified, but not just unified, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=106.52s)]
*  energized. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=110.92s)]
*  There's a sea change in Washington. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=111.92s)]
*  You felt it here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=113.64s)]
*  You were here during the inauguration events. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=114.64s)]
*  And we're all still kind of riding high after that amazing set of events. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=116.8s)]
*  I was with the president at the White House for three hours today with Leader Thune and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=120.92s)]
*  other leaders from the conference here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=124.4s)]
*  We are all united on this agenda, Shawna. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=126.84s)]
*  We know we've got to deliver on that America First agenda. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=129.3s)]
*  We will. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=131.44s)]
*  We've been working on it already. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=132.44s)]
*  The president is already going to have legislation to sign. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  His executive orders came out as a flurry, as we expected. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=136.04s)]
*  We're just getting started. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=139.32s)]
*  The late Riley Act is first? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=140.32s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=141.32s)]
*  And that's a border provision, which actually got a few Democrat votes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=142.32s)]
*  What a concept. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=144.96s)]
*  They got the message in the election, just like everyone did. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=146.12s)]
*  The American people had enough of the radical, woke, progressive agenda. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=149.64s)]
*  They delivered Donald J. Trump a 77 million popular vote outcome. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=152.98s)]
*  We got 74.7 million in the House, the highest popular vote total for the House ever for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=157.7s)]
*  the House Republicans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  We have a mandate and we're going to use it and these are the people who are going to get it done. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask all of you in the room. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  You understand that you win or lose together. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  Does everyone get that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Does everyone understand that nobody in this room, there are friends, new friends in this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  room, nobody here will get everything that they want? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=179.32s)]
*  Do we understand that too? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=182.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=183.32s)]
*  Everybody gets that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=184.32s)]
*  Jim Jordan even agrees. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=185.32s)]
*  We'll talk to Jim in a minute. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=186.32s)]
*  But if people understand that, when you talk to members, and I know there are people that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=189.0s)]
*  are giving you a hard time, and you explain this concept to them, are they open to hearing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=194.6s)]
*  you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=200.96s)]
*  Yes, everybody is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=201.96s)]
*  We are having family conversations. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=202.96s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=203.96s)]
*  We're a great deliberative body. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=204.96s)]
*  You throw food? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=205.96s)]
*  No, no food. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=206.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=207.96s)]
*  Pencils, but no. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=208.96s)]
*  We're in these rooms with whiteboards, working it out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=209.96s)]
*  Everybody has different ideas, but our principles are the same. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=212.46s)]
*  We want to scale down the size and scope of government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=215.08s)]
*  We want to get the border secured. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=217.24s)]
*  We want to unleash American energy again, get back to energy dominance, and unleash [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  the U.S. economy again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=222.84s)]
*  We've got to make sure that we don't have the largest tax increase in U.S. history, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  which is what would happen if we fail in this mission by the end of this year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=227.28s)]
*  A lot of things on the table, but we all know that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=230.58s)]
*  We know how high the stakes are, and we are going to deliver for the people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=232.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=236.52s)]
*  When you look at that insider advantage, Paul, I think it speaks volumes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=237.52s)]
*  They want this unity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=241.38s)]
*  It seems that the agenda that they're saying that they want is the Trump agenda. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=243.36s)]
*  If you really break it down to its simplest form, it's not that complicated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=248.72s)]
*  If implemented, it would be transformational. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=254.28s)]
*  It would, and it follows common sense. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=257.76s)]
*  That's the theme that you'll hear him talking about and all of us talking about. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=259.64s)]
*  We all ran on that agenda. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=262.72s)]
*  We were in our districts, and that's how we delivered that decisive outcome in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=263.9s)]
*  election. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=267.24s)]
*  What this is is getting America back, making America great again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=268.44s)]
*  It's not just a slogan. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=271.8s)]
*  It's what we're actually going to accomplish, and it is going to be a new golden age in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=273.0s)]
*  America, and we can't wait to get that thing going. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  Let me talk a little bit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=278.61999999999995s)]
*  Probably the two biggest issues in the campaign had to do with border security, the economy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=279.61999999999995s)]
*  One thing that I think really hurt the Democrats is they were in denial and flat out lied to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  us repeatedly saying the border is secure and the border is closed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=291.5s)]
*  It was never closed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  We showed it every night. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Joe was a cognitive mess for four years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  I put on the best montages we've ever put on television that late night comics should have used. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=301.38s)]
*  They lied about inflation being transitory. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=307.18s)]
*  The average family is struggling. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=311.1s)]
*  The cost of gasoline is $1.25, $1.50 more a gallon. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=312.58s)]
*  These are real impactful issues for the people in Ohio and Indiana and Texas and all around [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=316.54s)]
*  our great country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=321.78s)]
*  I think that was a big part of it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=323.9s)]
*  People are going to want results. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=326.7s)]
*  They want them pretty fast. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=328.26s)]
*  Now, starting with the border, we have known terrorists in the country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=330.02s)]
*  We have cartel members in the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=333.94s)]
*  We have gang members in the country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  We have known murderers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=337.78s)]
*  We have known rapists in the country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=338.88s)]
*  Okay, remain in Mexico comes back. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=340.94s)]
*  Love it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=343.58s)]
*  Build the wall. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=344.58s)]
*  Love it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=345.58s)]
*  All those things are important. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=346.58s)]
*  How do you possibly, in a country of this size, find the people from Iran and Syria [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=347.9s)]
*  and Afghanistan, Egypt and Venezuela and Russia and China and get them the hell out of here? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=356.22s)]
*  It's a serious challenge, but it will be our focus. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  We're going to begin with the dangerous criminals that we can find pretty easily. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  Many of them have committed crimes in the country, of course, some violent acts upon [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=367.1s)]
*  Americans and that's what the American people demand and deserve immediately. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=370.06s)]
*  That starts now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  Those executive orders were to jumpstart it and we'll be codifying a lot of what the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  president has already signed and we will fund this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=378.5s)]
*  We will restore the safety and security of the country for the American people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  If you don't have a border, you don't even have sovereignty and that's what people recognized [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=385.42s)]
*  in the election. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  They weren't buying the nonsense that the Democratic Party was selling. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  What do you do about cities and states that are sanctuary, safe havens for illegal immigrants? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=393.06s)]
*  Well, one of the things we have here is the purse strings, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=400.14000000000004s)]
*  That's the power of the purse and we've got to bring them to heel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=403.22s)]
*  These cities that have led to this chaos, that created the humanitarian catastrophe [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  that came from that border, that we'll be living with for decades. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=410.3s)]
*  It's going to take us a long time to unwind this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=412.88s)]
*  But to your point, the American people need to see immediate results. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=415.28s)]
*  They're going to see resolve here, they're going to see action, not just talk, and that's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=417.76s)]
*  already begun. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, let's go to a specific example. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  Our old friend Gavin Newsom. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=425.76s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=427.56s)]
*  A lot of Gavin fans here, I get to... [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=428.56s)]
*  I actually feel sorry for the people in California that were victimized. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=432.2s)]
*  What did they lose? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  13,000 structures. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's terrible and they never practiced the science of forestry. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=439.12s)]
*  How do you have a fire hydrant that has no water? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  How do you have a reservoir that is empty? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=445.06s)]
*  That is government to me at its worst, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  They didn't have control burns, they didn't clear the kindling, the brush that you should [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=449.92s)]
*  be clearing out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  But you go to California, they're a sanctuary state. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=455.88s)]
*  L.A. and San Francisco are sanctuary cities. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=458.72s)]
*  Okay, Gavin is doubling down on a fight Trump agenda, you know, Trump-proof California. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=462.84s)]
*  And so are you saying that California, if they continue to aid and abet law breaking [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=470.76s)]
*  and harbor illegal immigrants, money from D.C. gets cut off? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=477.94s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about conditions to this disaster. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=481.96s)]
*  Look, there are natural disasters, but there are man-made disasters as well, and they made [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=484.84s)]
*  terrible decisions. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=489.58s)]
*  They knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  That reservoir outside of Pacific Palisades, 117 million gallons, it was empty for a year. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=498.24s)]
*  They were trying to save a smelt fish or something. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=499.24s)]
*  I mean, their policies are upside down. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  They made decisions that made that disaster exponentially worse, and this is what the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=502.8s)]
*  American taxpayer is demanding of us everywhere else in the country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=507.48s)]
*  Put conditions- [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=510.76s)]
*  Take it a step further. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=511.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=512.76s)]
*  Any representatives from California here? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=513.76s)]
*  Anybody? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=515.12s)]
*  One, okay. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=516.12s)]
*  Hi. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=517.12s)]
*  He's bashful. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=518.12s)]
*  That's Gavin's cousin in the back. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=519.76s)]
*  No. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=522.76s)]
*  I'm kidding, I'm teasing. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=523.76s)]
*  Congressmen and women from California, Republicans, will come and say, if you do this to my state, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=526.76s)]
*  I'll never win re-election. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=531.4s)]
*  No. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=532.4s)]
*  The Californians that are here are fiscal conservatives. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=533.4s)]
*  They're fiscally responsible. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=536.44s)]
*  They know that we owe the taxpayer some accountability for those funds. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=537.6s)]
*  And so what we're talking about is making sure that they follow common sense in California. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=541.08s)]
*  And if there's culpability for what happened, there really needs to be conditions that follow [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=544.88s)]
*  that aid. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=548.92s)]
*  It's not unprecedented, by the way. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=549.92s)]
*  After Katrina and my staff, there were conditions placed upon the funds. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=551.0s)]
*  It happened after Hurricane Sandy up in the Northeast. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  So there's a tradition of doing this, and in California it certainly makes sense. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=557.04s)]
*  So we're going to come to consensus on what that looks like. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=561.12s)]
*  Would conditions be tied to defund dismantle no bail laws? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  I think, look, I think all those issues have to be addressed. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=566.8s)]
*  When you're talking about disaster aid, you don't want to leave the people who are really [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=569.24s)]
*  hurting without something because of the terrible political choices of their leaders. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  But we've got to thread that needle the right way. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=576.7199999999999s)]
*  I think that what we're talking about here is restoring common sense, even in the state [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=578.52s)]
*  of California. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=582.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=583.36s)]
*  The mandate we have, the responsibility we have, we're going to do that very thing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=584.36s)]
*  Are we prepared to build—if Russia and China have hypersonic missile technology, and we [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  don't, and if I'm right, and I don't know if you all agree with me, if you don't tell [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=593.24s)]
*  me, but the next generation of warfare, wars are not going to be fought on a battlefield. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=597.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=603.36s)]
*  They're going to be fought in air-conditioned offices. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=604.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  You all agree with that? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  I think we're behind. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  We have real concern about that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=611.12s)]
*  China is almost a peer-to-peer adversary with us. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=612.4799999999999s)]
*  We're the last great superpower on the planet, but we have to think logically about how we [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  fund our Defense Department. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=619.12s)]
*  It is going to be drone warfare. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=620.76s)]
*  It's going to be cyber warfare. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  It'll be all those new kinds of technologies, and we have to maintain our lead. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  We're the strongest nation in the history of the world. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=627.64s)]
*  We're the most successful, most powerful, also the most benevolent, by the way. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=630.2399999999999s)]
*  There's a reason for that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  We prioritize spending, and we make sure that we maintain peace through strength. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=635.72s)]
*  We've got a new commander in chief, a new sheriff in town, and he's going to bring that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=639.32s)]
*  back, and we're going to help. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=642.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=643.72s)]
*  And then I was talking to Claudia Tenney, who will join us a little later from New York. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=644.72s)]
*  New York would not have to tax people and chase people like me away. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=648.32s)]
*  I left. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm gone. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  And I hardly ever go back because they want to come after me. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=657.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=658.76s)]
*  And I had to do like 65 things according to accountants and lawyers to establish residency [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=659.76s)]
*  last year in Florida. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=663.6s)]
*  I have it fully domiciled, homesteaded. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  But the question is, you know, because of the energy emergency declaration of the president, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  would that then, would the supremacy clause kick in inasmuch as the federal government [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  would have the right to insist that fracking take place in a state like New York, which [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=681.2s)]
*  would make them rich? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=686.0s)]
*  So I'm a constitutional law attorney. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=687.0s)]
*  I got that question five times today. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=688.0s)]
*  We're trying to figure that out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=690.36s)]
*  Some of this is uncharted waters. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=691.36s)]
*  I mean, an emergency energy declaration. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=692.52s)]
*  What effect does that have on state laws? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=696.08s)]
*  We're 10th Amendment guys. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  We're states' rights. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=698.84s)]
*  But this genuinely is a national emergency and it got to be addressed that way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=699.84s)]
*  And they depleted our strategic petroleum reserves. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2T3LEYoyA&t=702.96s)]
