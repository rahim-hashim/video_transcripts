# Speaker Johnson reveals how Matt Gaetz's resignation can 'help' Republicans
**Fox News:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU)
*  Donald Trump, he was on Capitol Hill today meeting with House Republicans, who are now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=0.0s)]
*  only one seat away from reaching that magic number of 218. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=5.08s)]
*  It is expected they will have 222, 223 at the end of the day, officially retaining control [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=8.88s)]
*  of the chamber. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=16.36s)]
*  After a big endorsement from Donald Trump, while House Republicans then unanimously backed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=17.36s)]
*  Mike Johnson to remain as speaker of the House in January, he joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=22.2s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=29.0s)]
*  So the polls were showing there was a 70 to 80 percent chance you would lose the majority [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=30.36s)]
*  in the House. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=35.76s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=36.76s)]
*  You have a majority, albeit, again, a small majority, but you have a bigger problem, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  that is you will fairly soon be losing—well, you already lost Matt Gaetz, because he resigned [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=42.64s)]
*  today, but at least the phonic Mike Waltz. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=48.24s)]
*  How do you handle that so that at no point does control of the House get into the hands [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=51.56s)]
*  of the Democrats? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=57.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great problem to have, Sean. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=59.32s)]
*  We have an embarrassment of riches in the House Republican Conference. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=62.68s)]
*  Lots of talented people who are very attuned to the America First agenda, and they can [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=65.56s)]
*  serve the country well in other capacities. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=70.48s)]
*  But I've told President Trump, enough already. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=72.44s)]
*  You've got to give me some relief. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=75.08s)]
*  I've got to maintain this majority. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=76.08s)]
*  And he understands that, of course. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=77.4s)]
*  We've been talking about it hourly almost every day. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=78.92s)]
*  I think we're going to be settled. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  The numbers that you just projected there, I think, will be the reality, and we will [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=83.44s)]
*  have the majority. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=86.88s)]
*  I think these seats, Matt's, for example, his resignation today was to help us, because [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=88.12s)]
*  it starts the clock under Florida state law. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=93.16s)]
*  It's about an eight-week process to fill that seat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=95.16s)]
*  So if we do this quickly—and I've already called Governor DeSantis to ask him to kickstart [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=98.6s)]
*  this thing—we could have that seat filled by January 3rd, when the new Congress begins. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=103.12s)]
*  So that would be one seat replaced almost immediately. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=107.08s)]
*  All three of those that you mentioned, all three of my friends, all come from deep red districts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Would it be beneficial if Mike Walz of Florida did the same thing? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=114.48s)]
*  Well, I'm going to talk about—with him tonight about that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=120.68s)]
*  The timing matters. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=124.4s)]
*  We need to stagger these things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=125.6s)]
*  He's going to fill a very important position for the president and for the country, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=127.08s)]
*  we don't want to delay that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=130.88s)]
*  And he doesn't have to be appointed by the Senate, his position. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=132.0s)]
*  So we'll be able to figure that out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=134.56s)]
*  I know Governor DeSantis is going to be very busy working on all these matters, and the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=137.0s)]
*  one you discussed in the previous segment, filling the Senate seat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  So he'll be an active participant. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=144.84s)]
*  We'll get this done. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=146.6s)]
*  We're assured to have Republicans reelected in all these seats. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  And we'll work with a smaller majority of one or two for the amount of time that we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=151.28s)]
*  have to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  But we're going to be very aggressive, Sean. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  We are going to move the America First agenda for the American people beginning on day one. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=157.72s)]
*  And we have all this work stacked up, and we're ready to go. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=162.88s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about Elise Stefanik in New York. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=166.92s)]
*  How does the process work there? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=169.6s)]
*  Well, Elise has a similar situation under New York state law. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=171.48s)]
*  The governor there, Hocal, can't play games with this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=177.52s)]
*  It's about an 80-day process, roughly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=181.28s)]
*  And she comes from a very safe red district as well, so we'll get a strong Republican [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=184.68s)]
*  there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=188.84s)]
*  The county chairs are already working to come up with a consensus on who they'll put forward [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=189.84s)]
*  as the party's nominee, and we'll get that done. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  President Trump's already committed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=196.16s)]
*  If necessary, he'd go up there and do a rally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=197.16s)]
*  I mean, we will get this job done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=199.08s)]
*  But Elise is going to do an extraordinary job at the U.N. as the ambassador there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=201.08s)]
*  She's a strong voice. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=204.48s)]
*  She's Harvard-educated, really smart, very sharp and unflappable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=205.96s)]
*  And she will advance America's agenda at the U.N. again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=211.44s)]
*  That's a really important position, so I'm delighted she got it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=214.24s)]
*  So it almost sounds like it would be better if she were to resign sooner than later also. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=217.72s)]
*  Let me ask you, had you have—tell us first about the meeting with President Trump today, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=223.52s)]
*  where he endorsed you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=228.6s)]
*  And have you had any conversation with the new Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=230.2s)]
*  outwardly was very supportive of the Trump agenda? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=235.2s)]
*  And do you believe that the House, the Senate and the president are all going to be on the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=238.32s)]
*  same page? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=242.4s)]
*  Because in my view—in my mind, you have between 18 months and 24 months to get a lot [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=243.4s)]
*  of this agenda through. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=249.0s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  And the atmosphere here on the Hill is one of euphoria. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=253.96s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is united and energized like I've never seen it, Sean. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=256.8s)]
*  We had a great time with President Trump this morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=262.32s)]
*  He came and visited with the House Republican Conference, as you saw, and he gave a ringing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=264.2s)]
*  endorsement of me and our leadership team. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=267.72s)]
*  And that's very helpful. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=269.64s)]
*  The unity aspect of this is very important because we have to work together. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=270.8s)]
*  I did call Leader Thune today and congratulate him on his victory. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=275.56s)]
*  We talked for a short period of time about the agenda going forward and how we have to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=279.44s)]
*  do this in a bicameral fashion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=283.4s)]
*  We need the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans to be in lockstep on exactly the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=285.96s)]
*  same page, and we will be. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=289.68s)]
*  And he's excited about that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=291.32s)]
*  He's committed to the America First agenda as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=292.44s)]
*  And we laughed about how our home cities and counties—his county, my parish—voted overwhelmingly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  for President Trump in a landslide. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=302.44s)]
*  And our people and all the American people really desperately want and need and deserve [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=304.6s)]
*  this, and we're going to deliver. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=309.32s)]
*  Well, I'm encouraged by his words and everyone else's words, but you know what? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm a trust-but-verify guy, and I want to see that agenda adopted and adopted as quickly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  as possible. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=321.12s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=323.16s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D88GgELyPU&t=324.6s)]
