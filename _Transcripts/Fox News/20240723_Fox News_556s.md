# Jim Jordan: The Secret Service did a 180-degree turn
**Fox News:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA)
*  And earlier today, Secret Service Director Kim Cheadle was grilled by both Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=0.0s)]
*  and Republicans during a heated House hearing just nine days after the failed assassination [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=5.36s)]
*  attempt of former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at some of the highlights. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=13.58s)]
*  The Secret Service has a zero-fail mission, but it failed on July 13th and in the days [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=16.4s)]
*  leading up to the rally. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=22.54s)]
*  The Secret Service has thousands of employees and a significant budget, but it has now become [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=24.92s)]
*  the face of incompetence. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=31.64s)]
*  You know what it looks like, Director, it looks like you won't answer some pretty basic [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=34.92s)]
*  questions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=37.28s)]
*  It looks like you got a 9% raise and you cut corners when it came to protecting one of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=38.28s)]
*  the most important individuals, most well-known individuals on the planet. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=40.88s)]
*  A former president, likely the guy who's going to be the next president, looks like you guys [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  were cutting corners. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=47.52s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=48.52s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=49.52s)]
*  I am here today because I want to answer questions, but I also want to be caught. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=50.72s)]
*  You might want to, but you haven't answered, I don't think you've answered one question [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=54.72s)]
*  from the chairman, the ranking member, or me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=57.56s)]
*  So the idea that a report will be finalized in 60 days, let alone prior to any actionable [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=60.72s)]
*  decisions that would be made, is simply not acceptable. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=68.72s)]
*  It has been 10 days since an assassination attempt on a former president of the United [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=72.48s)]
*  States, regardless of party. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=77.36s)]
*  There need to be answers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=80.64s)]
*  You stated earlier, Secret Service is not political, is that correct? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=82.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=86.8s)]
*  Okay, would you say leaking your opening statement to Punchbowl News, Politico's playbook, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=87.8s)]
*  Washington Post several hours before you sent it to this committee as being political, yes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  or no? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=100.88s)]
*  I have no idea how my statement got out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=101.88s)]
*  Well, that's ****. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=104.4s)]
*  You said there's going to be accountability. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=106.28s)]
*  I understand you don't want to give us names. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=108.16s)]
*  When you say that, are you telling the committee that once it's concluded, you're prepared [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=110.4s)]
*  to fire the people on the ground who made poor decisions that day? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm prepared to take the actions necessary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=120.0s)]
*  No, no, that's nonsense. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=122.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=124.4s)]
*  Accountability, the failure was human. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=125.4s)]
*  That doesn't mean they're bad people, it means they failed that day and a president was almost, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=128.24s)]
*  a former president was almost assassinated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=133.76s)]
*  Now following the hearing and a rare joint bipartisan move, House Oversight Committee [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=137.28s)]
*  ranking member Jamie Raskin of all people joining Chairman James Comer for calling for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=141.8s)]
*  Cheetah's resignation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=147.44s)]
*  James Comer joins us now along with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=149.12s)]
*  Well, hell froze over, you and Jamie Raskin can barely agree on the time of day, so that's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=154.28s)]
*  a sign of good things. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=159.68s)]
*  You know, Congressman Comer, if there's a school shooting, usually within hours we have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=161.84s)]
*  a profile of the person that is responsible. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=166.48s)]
*  This is a failure of historic proportions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump was nearly assassinated that day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  And I heard her say, well, it was outside the perimeter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=177.44s)]
*  A hundred and thirty yards away is not outside the perimeter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=182.2s)]
*  You define the perimeter as any range in which a primary, in this case President Trump, could [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  be the victim of a shooting like this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=193.9s)]
*  I mean, I can't think of a bigger, bigger failure than this one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=196.62s)]
*  Why hasn't Joe Biden fired her? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=200.94s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden hasn't fired anyone. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=202.94s)]
*  That's our frustration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=205.66s)]
*  No one's ever held accountable in the Biden administration, not for Afghanistan, not for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=206.94s)]
*  the assassination tip on Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=211.9s)]
*  Look, to say under oath that being a hundred and thirty yards away from the highest point [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=214.46s)]
*  isn't in the range of the Secret Service protection of the leading candidate for President of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=221.46s)]
*  the United States, not to mention the former president, that's unacceptable. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=226.3s)]
*  That admission is unacceptable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=230.38000000000002s)]
*  No one who's a minimum wage security guard at a mall after closing hours would agree [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=232.34s)]
*  with that assessment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, she has to go. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  She did not demonstrate today her ability to give the American people answers to what [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  much less confidence that it won't happen again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=249.42s)]
*  She did not demonstrate to me or anyone else that she has the ability to lead an organization [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=252.44s)]
*  with a three point one billion dollar budget and over eight thousand employees. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=257.7s)]
*  I mean, this was a five hour hearing where she literally didn't answer any questions [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=263.38s)]
*  and for once the House Oversight Committee had unanimous agreement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=269.78s)]
*  Every question by every single member of the committee on both sides of the aisle [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=275.1s)]
*  was a question I think every American would ask at the cafe or at church or at a ballgame [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=278.42s)]
*  and she failed to answer any questions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=283.5s)]
*  It was a disgrace and she should resign. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=286.0s)]
*  If she won't resign, then Biden should for the first time terminate someone. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, Congressman Jim Jordan, you know I used to work in construction. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=293.54s)]
*  I fell off a roof three stories. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  I actually landed on my head and busted up my arm and my face but it did knock some sense [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  into me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=306.1s)]
*  I became a conservative but not to crack jokes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=307.1s)]
*  This insanity of a sloped roof is ridiculous. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=310.62s)]
*  That's not a sloped roof. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  I used to work on, you know, pitch roofs like this nearly vertical for crying out loud. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=316.06s)]
*  And so that's a big lie that she told. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=322.22s)]
*  And if she was going to, if they were going to put agents on it, fine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=325.62s)]
*  How about put sniper eyes on it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=329.62s)]
*  And how about instead of putting people inside, you surround the perimeter so a guy with a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=332.14s)]
*  ladder and an AR-15 can't climb up the roof? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  That's not a difficult decision, Jim Jordan. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=343.34s)]
*  And you know, she didn't answer many questions but even the ones she did, I don't know that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=345.02s)]
*  we can believe her. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=349.26s)]
*  Because remember what happened in the days, the first two days after the assassination [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=350.5s)]
*  attempt on President Trump, the Secret Service said it was absolutely false that President [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=354.46s)]
*  Trump's detail asked for additional resources. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=359.82s)]
*  And Secretary Mayorkas said it's unequivocally false that they asked for additional resources. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  But guess what happened, Sean? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=367.62s)]
*  Five days after that, the Secret Service said, well, there were actually some instances where [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=369.38s)]
*  we turned down the request that came from President Trump's detail. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=374.62s)]
*  Well that's a 180 degree change. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=378.5s)]
*  So they told us something that was not true in the days right after this attack on the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=380.74s)]
*  president and changed that story five days later. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=384.94s)]
*  How can we believe anything this individual says? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  So that was to me the biggest takeaway is I don't trust what she says and I think Jamie's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=392.08s)]
*  right, I think the country sees what needs to happen here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  Okay, but I know for a fact that there's going to be a paper trail and you went down this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=400.14s)]
*  road really hard trying to get an answer. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=405.94s)]
*  There's going to be a paper trail that shows that requests were made by the Trump team [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=408.7s)]
*  that were denied again and again. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=413.9s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=416.56s)]
*  Yeah, I want to know how many times they asked for additional resources. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=418.06s)]
*  I want to know how many of those happened after the Secret Service and our government [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=421.42s)]
*  was put on notice that Iran was trying to kill President Trump. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=424.8s)]
*  I think those are pretty important questions and she would not give us answers to those. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=427.98s)]
*  So I think that is critical. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=432.0s)]
*  I also want to know all the before questions. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=433.3s)]
*  How in the heck was he not given the resources he needed? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=435.64s)]
*  How in the heck were buildings? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=438.14s)]
*  There's a finite number of buildings that needed to be secured. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=439.78s)]
*  How scum they weren't. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=442.34s)]
*  It wasn't a huge number. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=443.34s)]
*  Two, three, four buildings had to be secured. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=444.34s)]
*  And then I want to know what happened in that critical five minutes. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=446.34s)]
*  6-09 the shooter is identified as a bad guy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  6-10 the message is sent to the counter snipers. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=452.02s)]
*  6-11 the bad guy shoots President Trump and others. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  6-12 the sniper takes out the bad guy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=458.3s)]
*  6-14 the president is escorted off the stage by Secret Service. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  What happened in that five minutes, that critical five minutes? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=464.46s)]
*  What happened second by second in there? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=467.06s)]
*  That's what we need to know to figure out so that this does not happen again. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=469.34s)]
*  And they identified a suspicious character, maybe a suspect, James Comer, and they still [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=474.94s)]
*  allowed President Trump to take the stage. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=480.18s)]
*  Why would they allow that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  They shouldn't. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=485.38s)]
*  I mean, no one would allow such a thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=486.38s)]
*  Every former Secret Service agent that we've spoken to, every whistleblower that's come [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=488.2s)]
*  Every person involved in any type of security that I've spoken to in the past nine days [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=493.3s)]
*  say this is unacceptable, this is common sense. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=498.7s)]
*  Any mediocre Secret Service director would know better than to answer the questions they've [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=501.66s)]
*  answered. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=507.42s)]
*  They made a huge mistake, but today she admitted the mistake, but she didn't instill confidence [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=508.42s)]
*  that this mistake won't repeat itself. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=513.82s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=515.88s)]
*  That's an issue of national security because there could be, would be assassins out there [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=516.88s)]
*  that might feel emboldened now that we have an incompetent Secret Service director and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=521.38s)]
*  that might lead them to do something horrible. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  We don't need that to happen. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=529.94s)]
*  We need people to respect the Secret Service, to fear the Secret Service, and we need our [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  president and our presidential candidates to have confidence that the Secret Service [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  has got their back. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=539.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVqdbDeTA&t=540.62s)]
