# Ted Cruz: This Senate border deal is a ‘bad deal’
**Fox News:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk)
*  Here now with more ranking member of the committee, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, you might want to explain what that actually means to people so they understand. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=4.48s)]
*  Well, sure. The federal government every year gives millions of dollars, tens of millions of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=9.52s)]
*  dollars across the country, hundreds of millions of dollars to airports all across the country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=14.4s)]
*  Chicago A'Hare Airport gets tens of millions of dollars. And what is the Democrat mayor doing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=18.64s)]
*  there? He is housing illegal aliens in the airport. He is trying to use the federal funds [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=24.0s)]
*  that are given to run an airport, that are given so people can fly in and out of Chicago, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  fly all over the world. Instead, he's using those funds to essentially pay for housing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=34.24s)]
*  for his sanctuary city. And under the terms of the federal grants, the money is supposed to go [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=40.08s)]
*  to keeping the airport available for the public not to be housing illegal aliens. And so I brought [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  together a group of Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee demanding answers from the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=51.44s)]
*  mayor of Chicago in terms of why he is abusing and misusing federal funds to defend his policy [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=55.68s)]
*  of sanctuary city. Yep. Well, they're doing the same thing at Logan Airport. So this weekend, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=65.12s)]
*  you were on one of the Sunday shows. I don't remember what show you were on. You gave an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=71.36s)]
*  interview and in the interview you said it's been floated that whatever compromise deal would be [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=75.28s)]
*  made in the U.S. Senate, which is different than the House bill. H.R. 2 is a good bill. H.R. 2. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=81.12s)]
*  Yes, excellent bill. Is a bill that would really stop illegal immigration. And all the Senate [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=86.72s)]
*  really needs to do is adopt what they already passed in the House. It would be that simple. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=92.4s)]
*  But you, and you're not the only one that has said this to me privately, that in fact there [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  were floating trial balloons. Well, yeah, but they might allow just a certain number of people, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  maybe even up to 5,000 illegal immigrants a day. You were chastised by your fellow Republican [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=108.48s)]
*  Senator Lankford and I'm like, okay, he's right. The language has not been written. Nobody has a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=116.0s)]
*  chance to read it. We don't know what's in their bill. All we do know is it's not H.R. 2. Why would [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=122.4s)]
*  we expect it to be better if it's going to be a compromise bill with Schumer and Biden? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=128.32s)]
*  Right. Look, in a perfect world, Congress would pass strong legislation that forces Biden to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=132.88s)]
*  secure the border right now. As you pointed out, the House of Representatives, the Republicans, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=138.32s)]
*  stood strong. They passed H.R. 2. It is a strong border security bill. I introduced H.R. 2 in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=142.72s)]
*  Senate. I'm the lead sponsor in the Senate of H.R. 2. If we wanted to actually do something [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=149.28s)]
*  to secure the border, that's what we would do. Unfortunately, this bill that's being discussed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=153.28s)]
*  in the Senate, it's not H.R. 2 because Chuck Schumer and the Democrats said, no, no, no, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=158.48s)]
*  we don't want to do that. That would actually work. So that's off the table. And instead, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=162.56s)]
*  Republican leadership in the Senate is pushing a deal that would not secure the border. It [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=167.44s)]
*  normalizes 5,000 people a day coming illegally into this country. Now, to give you a sense, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=173.6s)]
*  5,000 people a day is over 1.8 million illegal immigrants a year. That's about 6 million people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=179.52s)]
*  during Joe Biden's presidency. He, in fact, has allowed 9.6 million in. So I don't understand [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=185.92s)]
*  Republicans saying our position is we'll take two thirds of the invasion that Biden's allowed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=193.04s)]
*  We're OK with that. That doesn't make any sense to me. And so my view, this Senate deal is a bad [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=199.04s)]
*  deal. I've made this case repeatedly to my Republican colleagues. The speaker of the House [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=204.72s)]
*  has been unequivocal. This bill will not pass. It's dead on arrival in the House. And I said [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=209.84s)]
*  to my colleagues, all right, if it's not going to pass the House, what the hell are we doing? Why are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=215.76s)]
*  we giving Democrats an excuse? Because you know what Chuck Schumer is doing? You know what Joe [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=220.96s)]
*  Biden is doing? You know what every Democrat running for reelection is doing? They're saying, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=225.84s)]
*  well, gosh, we would have secured the border, but the Republicans won't pass our bogus bill [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=230.8s)]
*  that does nothing to secure the border. That is just dumb. It's political malpractice. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  We ought to fight to really secure the border. And I'll tell you, Sean, how we do that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=241.68s)]
*  We do that by beating Joe Biden in November by electing Donald Trump again as president. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=245.52s)]
*  And Donald Trump, I worked hand in hand with Trump. We secured the border [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=252.16s)]
*  in 2020 and we'll do it again. But Joe Biden has no interest in doing that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=256.24s)]
*  By the way, and then I see that you're up for reelection. And I read, is it true? George [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=262.24s)]
*  Soros is pouring all of this money into your state, targeting you and every Republican in Texas [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=266.96s)]
*  in the hopes of turning Texas blue. Is that all true? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=273.84s)]
*  Sean, that is exactly right. Chuck Schumer has made clear I am his number one target in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=277.28s)]
*  country. George Soros, the news broke last week, is pouring millions into the state of Texas, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=282.64s)]
*  trying to beat me. The Democrats are going to spend over $100 million. In my last reelection, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=288.0s)]
*  I won by less than three points. We had a poll come out just two weeks ago that showed this as a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=294.4s)]
*  two point race. And so I look, I want to tell your viewers, if you want to see Texas standing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=300.08s)]
*  strong, fighting to secure the border, fighting against this disaster from Washington, I want [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=306.0s)]
*  to encourage people go to Ted Cruz dot org, go to Ted Cruz dot org, make a contribution, give 25, 50, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=311.12s)]
*  a hundred dollars. We are facing $100 million on the other side. We're facing Chuck Schumer [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=317.68s)]
*  and Joe Biden and George Soros. And they want to take me out because if they flip Texas, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=325.2s)]
*  the country's gone. And so I want to encourage folks go to Ted Cruz dot Oregon and stand [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=330.96s)]
*  together to fight to take our country back. And six years ago at this time, you might remember, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=337.04s)]
*  the world didn't quite know how nuts that Beto Bozo or work was. They found out later. But anyway, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=343.92s)]
*  you've been fighting hard for the people of Texas for securing our borders and have been one of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=350.64s)]
*  the few reliable conservative voices in the Senate. Thank you, Senator. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA38V0hrbGk&t=355.04s)]
