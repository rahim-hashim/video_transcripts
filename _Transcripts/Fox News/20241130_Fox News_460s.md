*  86 percent because he put in place a lot of Trump's policies, right? He be building border barriers like President Trump did he's adding [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=36.84s)]
*  Consequences those across the border illegally. He's wrestling with trespass and people need to understand DPS has done a lot [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Not only is the government have his action protection protecting Texas [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=50.16s)]
*  To protect the United States because most of these illegal aliens aren't staying in Texas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=53.62s)]
*  They're moving all the country every ounce of fat in all those troopers sees is a less overdose deaths [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=57.78s)]
*  Every person they rest for trespass is one less got away so they get fingerprinted they get bed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=63.46s)]

*  But my plan is and I've been very vocal about this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=72.38s)]
*  We're going to contract as much work out as we can [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=75.22s)]
*  Work that doesn't require a badge and a gun because I need badges and guns on the street to do the deportation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=78.06s)]
*  Operates so when it comes to driving bus transportation, whether it's ground or air whether it's processing what are some other administrative duties? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=82.98s)]

*  Because right now we got badges and guns doing that work get them out of that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=93.58s)]
*  Administrative work put more on the street and that's what we're going to do into these sanctuary states and cities keep pushing back [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNkIt5RyRco&t=96.82s)]
