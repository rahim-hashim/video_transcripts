# Kayleigh McEnany: This report about Biden is 'disturbing'
**Fox News:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. I'm Kayleigh McEnany and for Sean. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it's been a rough week for Joe Biden with one bad headline after another. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=4.5s)]
*  On Tuesday, his son Hunter was found guilty, convicted on all charges for his federal gun [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=10.96s)]
*  crimes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=16.04s)]
*  And then on Wednesday, the president flew to Italy for the G7 summit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=17.04s)]
*  And his trip, it's safe to say, was marked by bizarre gaffes and embarrassing blunders. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=21.26s)]
*  In fact, according to a report from the Sun, this trip was such a disaster that it raised [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=26.72s)]
*  alarm among our allies, with one diplomatic insider saying he lost focus during discussions [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  before calling his condition, quote, the worst he has ever been in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  And a non-U.S. attendee told the Sun that Biden's missteps were, quote, embarrassing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=44.2s)]
*  And keep in mind, all this is happening while Russian warships arrived in Cuba. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=49.2s)]
*  About 100 miles from the U.S. mainland for military exercises right by the state of Florida. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Our adversaries are watching this embarrassing president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=62.92s)]
*  And when Pope Francis visited the summit earlier today, Biden greeted him in a rather awkward [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=67.36s)]
*  way with a forehead to forehead embrace. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=76.8s)]
*  Is he headbutting the pope? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=78.16s)]
*  It kind of looks like it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=79.48s)]
*  He left the pope looking a bit surprised. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=81.28s)]
*  And let's not forget what happened at the White House's Juneteenth celebration earlier [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=84.4s)]
*  this week, where Biden appeared to completely freeze while everyone around him was dancing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=88.72s)]
*  before delivering these gaff-filled remarks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=95.84s)]
*  Closing doors of opportunity, attacking the values of diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  If you can believe it, banning books about black experiences. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Trying to erase and rewrite history. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=110.56s)]
*  These black soldiers were a link and distinguished line of patriots, enslaved and freed, who [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=113.04s)]
*  risked their lives in every war since the founding, since the founding of our ideals [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=119.28s)]
*  that we don't know fully what American soil is. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=124.92s)]
*  Equality and freedom. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=128.56s)]
*  She knew so long as she was denied, our freedom can never be secured. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=129.96s)]
*  I mean, at least he found his way off the stage, but I think I need a translator for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=143.0s)]
*  his remarks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=161.8s)]
*  I couldn't quite understand that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=162.8s)]
*  And that was far from Biden's only disaster behind the podium this week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=164.44s)]
*  During a press conference in Italy with Ukraine president Vladimir Zelensky, he snapped at [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=168.2s)]
*  a reporter, completely lost it, for playing, quote, by the rules. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=173.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=177.8s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=178.8s)]
*  I have a question for Mr. President Zelensky shortly on the announcements, but if you don't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=179.8s)]
*  mind, I'd like to ask you about your discussions on the situation in Gaza here at the summit. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=184.6s)]
*  You were asked just a short time ago about it after the skydiving demonstration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=190.16s)]
*  Can you give us your assessment of Hamas's response? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=196.22s)]
*  And do you believe that they are trying to work towards a deal, or is this response working [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=199.26s)]
*  against a deal? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=205.02s)]
*  And what is your message to allies, including those here at the G7, about what more, if [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=206.74s)]
*  anything, the U.S. can do to drive towards a peace agreement? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=211.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=215.86s)]
*  I wish you guys would play by the rules a little bit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=216.86s)]
*  I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=220.38s)]
*  The reporter broke the rules. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=225.14s)]
*  Remember the rules. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=226.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, the White House Correspondents Association fired back after Biden's outbursts, saying [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=227.61999999999998s)]
*  in part, quote, at a presidential press conference at home or abroad, there are no preconditions [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=232.66s)]
*  regarding question topics. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=237.54s)]
*  An adding insult to injury on Biden's disastrous week, a disturbing new report, replete with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=240.22s)]
*  pictures and all, alleges that Biden repeatedly watched his dogs attack his secret service [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  agents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=252.1s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyaIQM2XXEA&t=253.1s)]
