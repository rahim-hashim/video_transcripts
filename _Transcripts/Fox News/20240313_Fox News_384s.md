# Hannity to Benjamin Hall: 'You have shown amazing courage'
**Fox News:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs)
*  Violent gangs, they have overtaken Haiti, causing a serious humanitarian crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=0.0s)]
*  It is only getting worse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=5.04s)]
*  One of the gang leaders, who some claim is now the most powerful man in Haiti, goes by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=6.84s)]
*  the name Barbecue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=11.9s)]
*  Some reports say he got the nickname because he likes to set his enemies on fire. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=13.74s)]
*  Barbecue claims it's just a nickname that his mother gave him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=18.96s)]
*  Mothers always give the name Barbecue, I'm sure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=23.16s)]
*  And as civilians look to flee Haiti, well, according to reports, U.S. Border Patrol agents [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=25.86s)]
*  in Florida, they are expecting a massive wave of illegal immigrants to come from the war-torn [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=30.82s)]
*  country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=36.86s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he says he is prepared. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=37.86s)]
*  He announced today he is sending 250 additional soldiers, aircrafts, boats to protect the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  state from illegal vessels coming to Florida. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=46.5s)]
*  Here now with more. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=50.06s)]
*  The author of The New York Times bestseller Saved a War Reporter's Mission to Make it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=51.06s)]
*  Home. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=56.42s)]
*  Our friend, Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall, and by the way, Ben has a Fox Nation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=57.42s)]
*  special, Sacrifice and Survival, a story from the front line. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=63.42s)]
*  It's also available right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=67.7s)]
*  First, it's great to see you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=70.22s)]
*  Well, I think tomorrow, it is two years since this ordeal in your life began. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=71.98s)]
*  I have met you, interviewed you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=78.42s)]
*  You have shown amazing courage, conviction, optimism in the face of what were very severe [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  injuries you sustained in Ukraine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=87.22000000000001s)]
*  I saw that you went back and met with President Zelensky. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=88.92s)]
*  How is your life going? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=92.04s)]
*  How are things going? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=93.04s)]
*  And what was it like with Zelensky? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=94.04s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's a pleasure to see you again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=95.4s)]
*  And you've been there to support me the whole way through this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=98.04s)]
*  But when we spoke and we met about a year ago when the hardback copy came out, I was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  at the end of my recovery, my physical recovery. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=106.26s)]
*  What's happened between then and now is sort of rebuilding my life, figuring out how to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=108.6s)]
*  live in the world with my injuries. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=113.32s)]
*  And I can tell you wholeheartedly that I know for sure that when you are knocked down, when [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=115.16s)]
*  you go through things that are difficult, you can pick yourself up and you can put yourself [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=119.74s)]
*  off in a better position than you were before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=123.4s)]
*  And that's how I feel speaking to you today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=125.68s)]
*  I feel that we've taken everything that happened to us and we've turned it around and we've [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=127.44s)]
*  made positive things out of it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=130.72s)]
*  So I sit here opposite you feeling so strong about everything that's happened now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=132.2s)]
*  And yes, I was back in Ukraine in November. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=137.44s)]
*  I met with President Zelensky. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  And that was a big moment for me because I wanted to go straight back to where the attack [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=140.92s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=143.96s)]
*  I wanted to go straight back to where I got my injuries. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=144.96s)]
*  And I wanted to send a clear message again that you won't be able to stop us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=146.84s)]
*  You won't be able to stop journalists who want to go and tell the news. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=150.96s)]
*  And you won't be able to stop me either. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=153.64s)]
*  So it was an emotional trip back to see Zelensky. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=155.06s)]
*  And of course, very interesting to hear what his plans are for Ukraine now that they are, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  frankly, losing in many places along the front lines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=161.04s)]
*  So it's been an incredible year for me, Sean. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be sitting here with you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  You always try and put yourself in the position of somebody that has gone through such a trauma [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=171.6s)]
*  as yourself. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, your life was hanging in the balance for a long time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  And I just don't think I could be as strong as you've been. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=180.04s)]
*  And it's inspiring in every way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=183.44s)]
*  And it's a tribute to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=185.28s)]
*  We see what's going on in Haiti. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=189.0s)]
*  It's a humanitarian disaster. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=190.0s)]
*  However, America does not have the ability to take in all of the people that I'm sure [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=192.72s)]
*  would love to make it here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=197.68s)]
*  How bad is it? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=200.4s)]
*  And are they targeting the U.S.? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=201.56s)]
*  Because they know, like so many other people from other countries, that our borders are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=204.28s)]
*  pretty much wide open. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=208.48s)]
*  Yeah, and I've been speaking to people in Haiti. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=209.68s)]
*  I've been there sometimes myself, and I've got some people on the ground. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=211.76s)]
*  If you can fly out of Haiti and the gangs control the airports, but those flights that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=215.16s)]
*  are leaving to South America, those are full of people whose plan is to fly to South America [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=219.4s)]
*  and make their way north. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=223.84s)]
*  It's no secret. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=226.0s)]
*  That's what many people are doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=227.0s)]
*  It's a country of 11 million people, and it is in a worse place today than it has been [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=228.0s)]
*  in decades. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=231.84s)]
*  As you said earlier, no government. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=232.84s)]
*  Gangs are taking over. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=235.4s)]
*  If you can leave, you are trying to leave. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=236.58s)]
*  And that's why DeSantis and Florida, they're taking extra care. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=239.12s)]
*  They're aware people are going to be coming in boats as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're bracing for more people who have come out of this criminalized, gang-infected [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=245.48s)]
*  country, coming north. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=251.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=253.64s)]
*  Look, it's—how bad is it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=254.64s)]
*  I mean, we're just getting these reports. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=257.12s)]
*  What do we know about this leader barbecue? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=259.44s)]
*  Did his mother really give him that nickname, or did he get it because of these horrific [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  evil acts that he perpetrated? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=266.98s)]
*  You know, I've been in some of the slums of Port-au-Prince, and as I walked through [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  Everyone was making goat sounds to me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=274.0s)]
*  And I asked the person I was with, I said, why are they doing that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=276.0s)]
*  And they said, oh, because they know that the westerners taste better than Haitians. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=278.28s)]
*  These guys, they are cannibals, some of them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=283.0s)]
*  So you know, that name may have a number of reasons behind it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=286.16s)]
*  But look, it's very bad. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=289.04s)]
*  He came to power. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=290.16s)]
*  He was head of the G9. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=291.16s)]
*  And to come to power, he took over all the fuel centers around the capital, and he held [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=292.32s)]
*  the hospitals hostage. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=297.28s)]
*  He said, unless you hand over power, unless you pay me, I'm going to let the people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=298.88s)]
*  in the hospitals die. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=302.8s)]
*  And so that's how he came to power. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=305.32s)]
*  And he continues to hold the country totally by its neck. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=307.0s)]
*  And he has said that he will work with the devil, in his words, in order to take power. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=311.06s)]
*  And many people are afraid that that could be Russia, China, Iran. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Many of those countries have an interest in destabilizing a country so close to the U.S., [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  such as Haiti. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=324.56s)]
*  And there's a big concern that they are actively trying to destabilize that country to make [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=325.88s)]
*  immigration more problems on the very doorstep of the U.S. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=331.2s)]
*  Now I want to remind people you have a Fox Nation special, Sacrifice Survival, a story [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  from the front line, which is now available at FoxNation.com. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  And now your book out in paperback, if I understand correctly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  And it is called Saved, a War Correspondence Mission to Make it Home. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=349.74s)]
*  It is beyond inspiring. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=354.12s)]
*  Great book. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=357.12s)]
*  It's also been an honor for me to get to know you, as well as I did. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=358.36s)]
*  We didn't know each other that well when you were reporting on the show. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=362.04s)]
*  And we've gotten to know each other. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=365.16s)]
*  And you're an inspiration to so many. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=366.56s)]
*  Ben Hall, great to see you, sir. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=368.48s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=370.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrc_jFNPcs&t=371.44s)]
