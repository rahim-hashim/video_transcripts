# Vivek Ramaswamy speaks on leading DOGE with Elon Musk: 'We're playing big'
**Fox News:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE)
*  All right, President-elect Trump continues to make key appointments for his next administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, yesterday, he announced that Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk would lead the new Department [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=5.2s)]
*  of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=11.0s)]
*  Earlier today, Vivek took to Twitter, saying in part, quote, if we're ever going to crush [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=12.5s)]
*  the bureaucracy, it's going to happen from the outside, just the hard truth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=18.6s)]
*  And today, the department's ex-account was launched, with a tweet saying, quote, working [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=23.96s)]
*  overtime to ensure that your tax dollars will be spent wisely. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=28.24s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy joins us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=32.0s)]
*  All right, so you're partnering with the smartest guy in the country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=34.32s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=38.56s)]
*  And the richest guy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=40.2s)]
*  But you look at Elon Musk, and he's a genius. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=41.2s)]
*  If you can figure out a way to go save those astronauts that are lost in space, God bless [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  you, I could never figure that out in 500 lifetimes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=49.28s)]
*  So I admire that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=53.06s)]
*  He's talking about $2 billion in cuts by identifying waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=54.64s)]
*  Is that a realistic number? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  That's a big number. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=62.76s)]
*  Yeah, $2 billion isn't a big number, but $2 trillion is, Sean. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=63.76s)]
*  And that's what we're looking at here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=68.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=69.16s)]
*  Lookâ€” [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=70.16s)]
*  $2 trillion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=71.16s)]
*  I stand corrected. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=72.16s)]
*  No, no, I want to be very clear about the scale. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=73.16s)]
*  I want to be very clear about the scale that we're thinking here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=74.16s)]
*  We're not thinking small. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=76.16s)]
*  We're playing big here, because we have a once-in-a-generation mandate right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=77.16s)]
*  The American people have voted for drastic reform of the government, and our federal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  government is broken. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  It's no secret that it is a fourth branch of government, the administrative state that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=86.64s)]
*  makes most of the rules, that creates a federal bureaucracy that's hampering our economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=90.64s)]
*  So what do we want to do? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=95.16s)]
*  We want to go in and slash and burn that bureaucracy to help Americans, stimulate the economy, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=96.28s)]
*  and to restore self-governance against Sean. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=101.54s)]
*  The people we elect to run the government, they're not even the ones who run the government [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  anymore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=107.68s)]
*  We're talking about these unelected bureaucrats. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=108.76s)]
*  Republican politicians have talked about fixing this for a long time, not with a lot of progress. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=110.76s)]
*  So I do think it's going to take a couple of outsiders. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=115.18s)]
*  Elon and I have built a great friendship over the last year. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=116.92s)]
*  I agree. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=119.4s)]
*  We're working together intensely, and we're not going to stop until we get the job done. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=120.4s)]
*  When Ronald Reagan became president, on the issue of defense, he called it a gap of vulnerability. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  China, Russia, they have hypersonic missile technology. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=130.68s)]
*  We do not. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=134.58s)]
*  We're going to have to spend a lot of money on defense to catch up and to surpass our [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=135.62s)]
*  enemies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=140.62s)]
*  Social Security, Medicare, are headed towards insolvency. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=141.62s)]
*  We'll have to spend money there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=145.5s)]
*  To me, that money is going to be made up through energy dominance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=147.78s)]
*  That's where I think our greatest opportunity is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=151.86s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  Look, part of what's holding back energy dominance in this country is that administrative state. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  Look at the regulations coming out of the Department of Interior, the slow permitting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  requirements, how hard it is to open a new refinery. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  So I think that is the root cause of our failure as a country, is this unelected fourth branch [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=168.33999999999997s)]
*  of government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=173.61999999999998s)]
*  And I think they look at elected officials as these cute little puppets that come and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=174.61999999999998s)]
*  go every little while. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=180.05999999999997s)]
*  There's a new sheriff in town. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=181.05999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's the president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=182.06s)]
*  He has mandated us for radical, drastic reform of this federal bureaucracy with the learnings [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=183.22s)]
*  of that first term. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=188.26s)]
*  And you look, Elon and I, I mean, Elon's solving major problems of physics. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=189.94s)]
*  I came from the world of biology. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  What we're solving here now is not a natural problem. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=194.78s)]
*  This is a manmade problem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=197.34s)]
*  And when you have a manmade problem, you better darn well have a manmade solution. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=198.84s)]
*  That's what we're bringing to the table. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=203.06s)]
*  We're assembling the brightest minds in the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=204.38s)]
*  This is the equivalent of a modern Manhattan project to take on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=206.78s)]
*  I think the major problem holding our country back, it's the federal bureaucracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  Target that cost, save the money, restore self-governance. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  And Sean, I think we did something pretty novel here, if I may say so. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=217.86s)]
*  If I just want to say is this government, Department of Government Efficiency, it is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=221.74s)]
*  built with an end date. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=225.3s)]
*  We want to be done by July 4th, 2026. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=227.02s)]
*  So for the first time in history, creating a department, creating a new government project [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=230.18s)]
*  that is designed to end when its work is complete, that's on the 250th anniversary of America's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=234.5s)]
*  Declaration of Independence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=239.38s)]
*  And that's the gift we want to give this country on that birthday. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=241.3s)]
*  Well, I hope Congress adopts your recommendations. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=244.3s)]
*  They did not do so in the Reagan years with the Grace Commission. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=247.4s)]
*  What are the first things you're going to look at? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=250.94s)]
*  Look, we've got a long list, and a lot of this is to stay tuned for what's coming on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=252.78s)]
*  January 20th, because some of this we do want to come in a big way swinging on day one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  But I'll give you some examples, Sean. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=262.54s)]
*  Most federal employees right now, most Americans don't recognize this, they don't even show [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=264.54s)]
*  up to work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=268.18s)]
*  So if you tell people you have to affirm that you want a job, that you have to show up to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=269.34s)]
*  work five days a week, how many of those employees are going to quit right out the gate? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=272.82s)]
*  That's a question we should ask. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=276.7s)]
*  Those are the kinds of inefficiencies. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=278.22s)]
*  Low-hanging fruit that Democrats and Republicans or black or white Americans alike can agree [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=280.3s)]
*  on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  We should not be wasting that kind of money as a federal government. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  And so in that sense, tackling this kind of waste, fraud, abuse, bureaucratic bloat, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=289.98s)]
*  we're going for the stuff that's basic common sense that most Americans actually agree on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=294.98s)]
*  And I hope we're going to actually be able to help unite the country by eliminating waste, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=299.94s)]
*  which is something that all Americans, regardless of partisan affiliation, can get behind. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's how Elon and I are thinking about it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  I have less than a minute, but I think part of it has to be baseline budgeting, eliminate [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=310.0s)]
*  the built-in increases every year that we have for every department. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=314.32s)]
*  I think getting rid of the Department of Education, giving that money directly to states, or maybe [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=318.4s)]
*  adopting something like the Penny Plan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=322.96s)]
*  Maybe it's the Nickel Plan, where you cut, you know, a nickel out of every dollar every [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=325.64s)]
*  year for five years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  You balance the budget, which has not been done since Newt Gingrich was the speaker of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=332.0s)]
*  the House. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  You have about 30 seconds. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, yeah, well, funny enough, Sean, actually, much of our spending is even for programs [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=339.32s)]
*  whose authorization has lapsed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  So the authorization to spend the money, the appropriation has lapsed, and yet still the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=346.76s)]
*  money still goes out the door. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  That's how broken the bureaucracy is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=352.12s)]
*  So I think it's going to take a couple of business guys to come in, do this from the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  outside. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=356.76s)]
*  We're going to have fun while we're at it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=357.76s)]
*  It's going to be the most transparent effort. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=359.04s)]
*  We're certainly aiming to make this a transparent process so the American people can see how [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=360.92s)]
*  their money is being wasted. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=365.24s)]
*  So we're all in it on the same team to fix it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWUBrcUxCE&t=367.02s)]
