# Lindsey Graham: Biden has let Iran get away with murder
**Fox News:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA)
*  And the Harris-Biden administration, they continue to turn their back on Israel tonight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=0.0s)]
*  when asked yesterday, Biden said Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was not doing enough to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=6.08s)]
*  secure a hostage deal with Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=12.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=15.64s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think it's time for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do more on this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=16.64s)]
*  issue? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=22.16s)]
*  Do you think he's doing enough? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=23.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=24.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris, God forbid, wins in November. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=26.04s)]
*  Her administration would be worse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=29.08s)]
*  Take a look at this shocking reaction from her running mate, Tim Walz, when asked about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=30.96s)]
*  the Israeli hostages that were murdered, as we all have seen, in Gaza, shot in the back [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=35.84s)]
*  of the head. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=41.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=42.56s)]
*  What's your reaction to the six hostages being found in Gaza? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=43.56s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=48.56s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=49.56s)]
*  They were killed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=52.56s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=53.56s)]
*  Let me drink my shake. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=54.96s)]
*  Remember, Kamala herself wants to completely eliminate the term radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=55.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=61.36s)]
*  You must have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=62.36s)]
*  which is more than how many have over-defeated, been the greatest victims of terror. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=71.36s)]
*  Everyone also has the courage to reject that term, illegal alien. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=79.16s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=92.16s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=95.16s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=97.16s)]
*  Well, then, who attacked us on 9-11? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=101.16s)]
*  Who's entering our country illegally? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=104.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, college kids, they're back at school, and so are the radical pro-Hamas protesters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=106.96s)]
*  Earlier today, NYPD made two arrests, as dozens of these protesters were swarming Columbia [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=112.96s)]
*  and their campus on the first day of class here with reaction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=119.16s)]
*  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is with us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=122.36s)]
*  So, when you look at Israel in particular here, this administration has withheld arm [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=125.36s)]
*  shipments, and they haven't gotten much, especially compared to Ukraine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=132.11999999999998s)]
*  They have constantly called for restraint, restraint, restraint. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  They have blamed Israel, and they've done everything but what they should do, and that's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  the right thing, which would say, well, you lost the equivalent of 40,000 Americans in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  a day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  We fully support your right to win your war against radical Islamic terrorists, although [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  she rejects that term. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=159.6s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=161.6s)]
*  Well, my reaction is, I've got to remember on television here, I'm here in Las Vegas [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=163.6s)]
*  with the Republican Jewish Coalition. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  These are some of my best friends in the world. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  They have family in Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  They're great Americans. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=180.12s)]
*  They're Jewish. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=181.12s)]
*  They're Republicans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=182.12s)]
*  They're trying to help President Trump win. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=183.12s)]
*  They're trying to help me take back the Senate and all my colleagues and hold the House. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  God bless them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  Matt Brooks, Norm Coleman, Maryam Adelson, great troop. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  They're heartbroken. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  Most all of us have interacted with the hostage families. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  One of the most despicable things I've ever seen since I've been in politics was the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  vice presidential candidate of the Democratic Party refusing to answer a question about [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  the death of hostages at the hands of religious Nazis called Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=213.36s)]
*  He walked away from the question. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=218.84s)]
*  That video clip is all over the Mideast, my friend, and when Kamala Harris refused to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=221.04s)]
*  attend a joint session of Congress and sit behind Bibi as the vice president, her job [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=226.6s)]
*  called for, boycotting his speech, that made news all over the terrorist capitals of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  And people are naive and dangerous. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=240.78s)]
*  When he refused to answer that question, that's a signal to all the terrorist groups in Ayatollah, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=243.28s)]
*  they really don't give a damn about our friends in Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  They have slow-walled weapons. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  They have basically set silent while people accuse Israel of being engaged in genocide. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=256.8s)]
*  And what Waltz did is throwing gasoline on a fire. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=265.02s)]
*  When Donald Trump wins, this is going to end. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=269.02s)]
*  There are Americans still in captivity. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=272.94s)]
*  Over 40 Americans have been killed by Hamas on October the 7th, right at 40. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  And here's my question to Joe Biden. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  Have you done everything you can to hold the Ayatollah accountable for wreaking havoc on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=283.58s)]
*  Americans and the world at large? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=288.82s)]
*  When Donald Trump gets in office, these hostages will come home, because he will tell the Ayatollah, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=291.58s)]
*  I'm holding you accountable for the safety and the well-being of these people. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  And if they don't come home, you're going to pay a price. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=303.26s)]
*  Joe Biden has let Iran get away with murder. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  He's infused them with money. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  In their eyes, he is a weak person. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=312.56s)]
*  Only person weaker than him is Kamala Harris. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=315.82s)]
*  God bless our friends in Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=319.7s)]
*  God help our friends in Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=321.98s)]
*  Donald Trump is on the way. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, President Trump had the Iranians near bankruptcy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=326.86s)]
*  And Harris and Biden allowed the Iranians—they ignored the sanctions, allowed them to take [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  in billions and billions of dollars, which got them rich, which helped them fund these [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=340.66s)]
*  proxy wars, Hamas out of Gaza, Hezbollah out of Lebanon, the Houthi rebels, and then there [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=345.48s)]
*  even firing missiles into Israel themselves. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=352.22s)]
*  But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would not participate in their retaliation, which to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=355.58s)]
*  me has abdicated America's role as the leader of liberty and freedom around the world. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=361.66s)]
*  Iran cannot be allowed to not only fight the proxy wars, but get rewarded financially by [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=368.38s)]
*  an American administration the way they have been. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=375.08s)]
*  Let's look and break down what you just said. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=379.06s)]
*  The Houthis attack our allies in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=382.62s)]
*  We do nothing to help them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=385.94s)]
*  The Iranians send missiles toward Saudi Arabia and oil fields. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=388.02s)]
*  We do nothing really to help. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=393.5s)]
*  We've lost deterrence. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=395.7s)]
*  We've lost deterrence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=397.74s)]
*  Nobody is afraid of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=399.26s)]
*  What did Donald Trump do? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  He went to maximum economic pressure. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=403.94s)]
*  He put Iran in an economic box. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=406.86s)]
*  And when he heard that Soleimani, their Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader, was plotting to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=409.86s)]
*  kill Americans in Iraq, he blew him up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=415.62s)]
*  Now what is Biden doing? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=420.62s)]
*  Charging Senoar with crimes in the American court. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  We're not fighting a crime here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=426.82s)]
*  We're fighting a war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=429.06s)]
*  Senoar could care less about being indicted by Garland. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=431.82s)]
*  Senoar, your days are numbered, pal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=436.82s)]
*  We're not going to indict you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  We're going to kill you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=441.58s)]
*  You mentioned Miriam Adelson. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=444.38s)]
*  I know her and I knew her husband Sheldon. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=446.02s)]
*  And they had moral clarity. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=449.7s)]
*  They understood that this is a battle of civilizations, good versus evil. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=452.26s)]
*  Please do my best. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=457.82s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjBLamL7pA&t=458.82s)]
