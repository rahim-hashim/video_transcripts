# Adam Carolla: Left-wing 'lunatics' running California into the ground
**Fox News:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA)
*  Here with more, Adam Carolla himself is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=0.0s)]
*  He sadly also, like so many in Southern California, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=3.12s)]
*  forced to evacuate his home not long ago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=6.36s)]
*  How close was the fire to your house? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  It may have been in my house. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=14.0s)]
*  I still don't know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=16.28s)]
*  I'm in Malibu. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=17.8s)]
*  I'm near the coast, near PCH, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=19.68s)]
*  and many structures around me, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=22.44s)]
*  almost all the structures around me have burned. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Along PCH and in the mountains. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=29.16s)]
*  So I still haven't gotten confirmation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=31.32s)]
*  whether my home is there or gone. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=33.96s)]
*  Not a good feeling. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=37.84s)]
*  Let's go to the story that you told. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  One thing, we have similar blue collar roots. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  You wanted to be a fireman. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=45.16s)]
*  You were told to come, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=47.34s)]
*  basically you'd be contacted in seven years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=48.18s)]
*  That happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=50.6s)]
*  And then you go, you show up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=51.82s)]
*  And tell that story again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=54.18000000000001s)]
*  What actually happened? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=55.8s)]
*  The letter went to the old house I lived in, my dad's home. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=57.28s)]
*  I'd been a construction worker for seven years [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=62.28s)]
*  at this point, but I figured I'd take the test anyway [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=65.16s)]
*  on a whim. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=68.24s)]
*  It was on a Saturday at Hollywood High. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  I stood in line and I kept asking everyone around me, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=72.18s)]
*  when did you sign up? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=75.2s)]
*  Cause it seemed bizarre to me [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=76.4s)]
*  that I'd signed up seven years earlier. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=77.6s)]
*  And when I asked the girl behind me, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=80.2s)]
*  a woman of color who is diminutive by the way, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=82.0s)]
*  five foot nothing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=84.76s)]
*  She said three days ago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=86.26s)]
*  Wow, unbelievable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=90.12s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  The mayor was in Ghana. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=92.86s)]
*  The mayor comes back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  The mayor has asked a lot of questions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=95.64s)]
*  We just played her non-response. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  Is that her answer to the people in Los Angeles [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=101.78s)]
*  that are losing everything? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's how we are in LA. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=107.5s)]
*  The city officials are very left leaning [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=110.06s)]
*  and very deep blue. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=114.34s)]
*  And they get actually angry [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  when you ask them any substantive questions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=118.3s)]
*  They're not really even used to being asked [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=120.9s)]
*  any difficult questions [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=123.14s)]
*  because the media is in their hip pocket as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=124.54s)]
*  So they don't even know how to react [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=128.74s)]
*  when a tough question is asked. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=131.9s)]
*  Are there any efforts that you know of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=134.74s)]
*  in Southern California to have controlled burns? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=137.34s)]
*  Any efforts that you know of to remove the brush [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=141.46s)]
*  that is the kindling for fires [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=144.82s)]
*  like we're watching tonight? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=146.7s)]
*  We had a major fire in Malibu three and a half weeks ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=150.18s)]
*  It's not like it was three and a half years ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=155.18s)]
*  This is an ongoing issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=158.94s)]
*  And Newsom likes to say it's now year round [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=161.98s)]
*  because he wants to talk about climate change. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=165.18s)]
*  So he's the first guy who's aware of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=167.5s)]
*  They wanna blame everything on climate change, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=170.66s)]
*  but it's really they're in action. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=172.72s)]
*  That's why we're in this predicament. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=175.0s)]
*  But they won't, why is it, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=178.0s)]
*  why are they so reluctant to have, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=181.6s)]
*  to use the known practices that work? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=185.72s)]
*  Removing the brush, removing the debris, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=189.0s)]
*  having controlled burns. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=191.64s)]
*  Where is this reluctance coming from? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=193.76s)]
*  Are they afraid of endangered species? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=195.56s)]
*  Because if they're doing this for the environment, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=198.44s)]
*  okay, that sounds great on paper, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=200.96s)]
*  but I would imagine that the skies over Los Angeles [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  and Pacific Palisades right now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=206.68s)]
*  are not exactly the healthiest in the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, first things first, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=213.96s)]
*  the second Donald Trump said to clean up the forest, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=216.36s)]
*  that's when you knew it wasn't gonna happen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=221.4s)]
*  Cause whatever he says, we do the opposite of. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=223.36s)]
*  He wants to build a wall on the border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=226.16s)]
*  We wanna tear it down. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=228.24s)]
*  He likes ivermectin. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=229.6s)]
*  We say tour space. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=231.16s)]
*  He wants to clean up the forest where you reject everything. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=232.44s)]
*  So we'll do the opposite of everything [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=235.52s)]
*  Trump ever suggested, number one. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=237.24s)]
*  The state is run by handful of environmental lunatics, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=240.0s)]
*  like the Coastal Commission, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=244.2s)]
*  eight or 12 unappointed or unelected people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=246.44s)]
*  deciding what goes on in the entire state. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=250.44s)]
*  That's how it's always been, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=253.16s)]
*  a handful of lunatic nut jobs [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=254.44s)]
*  running everyone else into the ground. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=257.4s)]
*  So the odds are pretty high [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  that you probably lost your house today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=263.23999999999995s)]
*  I would say it's a coin toss at best. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=267.88s)]
*  I've seen a lot of footage of houses [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=270.44s)]
*  that were around my house, burnt to the ground. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  There's still some hope that my house is still intact, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=276.96s)]
*  but if it is, it'll be a miracle. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's pretty unbelievable. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=284.96s)]
*  I mean, the fact that the government would put, quote, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  environmental concerns [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=289.56s)]
*  and then allow an environmental disaster in its place [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  is pretty unbelievable to me. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=294.36s)]
*  Do you have any message for these elected officials? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Anything you wanna say, any last word? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=299.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=304.04s)]
*  You're gonna lose a whole lot of votes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=305.92s)]
*  if you don't get it together. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=308.92s)]
*  People, and look, you gotta understand, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  Malibu, the Palisades, Santa Monica, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=313.24s)]
*  these are deep blue progressive cities [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=317.32s)]
*  who vote and raise money [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=319.88s)]
*  and bend over backwards for these people, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=322.28s)]
*  but they don't have a house anymore, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=324.56s)]
*  and that's because of you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=327.28s)]
*  So it's time to get it together. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=331.56s)]
*  I don't have faith in the people of California [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=332.4s)]
*  that they can turn the state red anytime soon, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  but I do, I pray for the people of California, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=337.08s)]
*  you, your neighbors, everybody. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  I hate seeing people's lives up in flames, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  literally like we're watching tonight. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=345.2s)]
*  Adam, Godspeed, my friend, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=347.56s)]
*  we're praying for everybody out there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFNYEonkeA&t=349.36s)]
