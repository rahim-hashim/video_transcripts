# ‘The View’ is not representing American women, says former co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck
**Fox News:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s)
*  Well, she's going to host a panel with female governors. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, that's interesting. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Here with reaction, broadcaster, author of the upcoming children's book, God's Masterpiece, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=4.08s)]
*  An Adventure in Discovering Your Worth, Elizabeth Hasselback is back with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=9.84s)]
*  By the way, everybody needs to know their worth. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=13.64s)]
*  I love the title. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=15.76s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=17.36s)]
*  Let's go back in time for a second. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=18.8s)]
*  And how many years were you working on that hard-hitting news show on ABC called The View? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  How many years were you there? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=27.04s)]
*  I was there 10 years, Sean. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=30.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me tonight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=31.48s)]
*  And you're probably still suffering PTSD to this day, just my guess. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=34.12s)]
*  There was a time I used to even go on that show. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  But I remember, before you came to Fox, and you'd come on the show at times, I remember, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=41.4s)]
*  I'd watch you, and it was three, four on one every day, and it got progressively worse [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  and worse and worse, to the point where if you opened your mouth, uttered a sentence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=53.6s)]
*  or a phrase, it was like, you know, it just pounced on you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=58.0s)]
*  Now their ratings are lower than they've ever been. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=62.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the last time you looked at them, but they're a fraction of what they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=65.16s)]
*  were when you were on the show. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=68.6s)]
*  And I think it's in large part because they've gone so hard left. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  But for the people that do watch, they're never going to hear Kamala in her own words. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  They'll never vet her. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=79.48s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=80.92s)]
*  You can't even put a value on that, can you, in terms of a campaign contribution? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=82.0s)]
*  No, I'd like to think of my time there as near prison sentence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=92.28s)]
*  When you would come on, I would feel like there's a friend, there's someone who can [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=93.28s)]
*  rescue me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  I did enjoy my time there in the engaging of topic debate with Whoopi Goldberg. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  We're friends, Joy Behar and I, colleagues at times, friends. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  What I think the viewer is missing there right now is the ability to hear another perspective, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  is that table, if you ask them who are you voting for right now in this election, they're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=116.88s)]
*  not representing American women. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=119.6s)]
*  They're just not. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  They're not representing the voters in America. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=125.0s)]
*  I doubt there's one person on that panel that would say they were voting for Donald Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=126.0s)]
*  Maybe secretly they are because they believe that they have to choose the better leader, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=129.32s)]
*  the elite leader for the American people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=133.04s)]
*  And they're just part of a media swarm. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=135.4s)]
*  Sean, you know this is happening. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=136.92s)]
*  The punishment for conservative female voices right now is severe. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=139.16s)]
*  You're being canceled. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Your contracts are not being renewed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  You're not being invited back to network meetings per se. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  There's a big punishment there because they want their mission to be put forward only. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  And the latest tactic of the media, and really everyone has to stay awake, is that they want [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=156.08s)]
*  to convince American voters that relatability is the equivalent of ability. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's not. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=167.12s)]
*  Like you just talked about Kamala Harris supposedly eating a bag of Doritos so emotionally charged [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=168.12s)]
*  after hearing this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=173.24s)]
*  The commander in chief, potentially, that's the emotional response of the leader of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=174.84s)]
*  free world is to binge eat a bag of Doritos. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=181.04s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Can you imagine Putin, how he deals with things, chugging down a bag of Sour Patch Kids because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  he's depressed about something not going his way or back in the day, Soleimani? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  What is he, binging on Funyuns? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=195.04s)]
*  I doubt that's the actual response of an elite leader, whether you agree with what they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=196.04s)]
*  leading or not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=200.12s)]
*  The relatability cloud that's being dusted over Americans right now is only to hide the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=201.88s)]
*  fact that there's a lack of ability. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris failed at the border. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=209.76s)]
*  So what do we want to do? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=211.24s)]
*  Give her the globe? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=212.24s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=213.24s)]
*  I am just shocked. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=214.24s)]
*  I think this is, aside from politics, if you just go on your aptitude, we have a big problem [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=215.24s)]
*  here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=220.84s)]
*  And it's scary that she hasn't spoken and had to answer any questions from adversaries [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=221.84s)]
*  in 30 days. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=226.2s)]
*  She was slotted in in the most, like, I think unnerving moment for our democracy and then [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=227.9s)]
*  now is denying that she's part of the Biden economic program. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=235.46s)]
*  So she wants to separate herself. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=240.34s)]
*  Her only platform right now, and everyone's like, get to know Kamala, get to know Kamala. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=241.96s)]
*  You can try, but she will change. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=246.26s)]
*  She has a use-em or lose-em mentality. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=249.5s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=251.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=252.74s)]
*  Oh, we appreciate it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=253.74s)]
*  Elizabeth Hausenbach, thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2AdBaax9s&t=255.18s)]
