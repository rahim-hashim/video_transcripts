# Kayleigh McEnany: This is beyond disturbing
**Fox News:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=0.0s)]
*  And for Sean, anti-Israel protests continue to disrupt college campuses across the country, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=4.0s)]
*  where police have now arrested thousands of agitators as they work to clean up the encampments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=10.0s)]
*  And oh, you better believe they need some cleaning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=16.0s)]
*  Some of what police have found left behind is beyond disturbing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=18.0s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=22.0s)]
*  According to New York police officers, signs were left behind on NYU's campus. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=23.0s)]
*  They found this today, which read both, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=28.0s)]
*  Isn't that nice? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=35.0s)]
*  NYU did provide a statement this evening saying they will continue to oppose anti-Semitism and discrimination on campus. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=36.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, anti-Israel radicals at the University of Pennsylvania have begun circulating protest how-to guides, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=44.0s)]
*  including one that's titled, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=51.0s)]
*  that encourages protesters to take more risk. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, what risk, you ask? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=58.0s)]
*  Another details exactly how to break into a building. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=60.0s)]
*  That's what we saw at Columbia this week. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=64.0s)]
*  And while all of this was going on, it took President Biden at least nine days, nine days, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=66.0s)]
*  to issue a formal statement condemning the violent protest. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=74.0s)]
*  But during those nine days, he found time to put out a statement on Florida's abortion laws. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=79.0s)]
*  That was important. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=84.0s)]
*  That was under his name. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=85.0s)]
*  He attended political fundraisers in D.C. and Delaware. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=87.0s)]
*  He went to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=90.0s)]
*  He yacked it up with the press, had a great night. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=93.0s)]
*  He even found time to joke with Howard Stern. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=95.0s)]
*  This is what we call leading from behind. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=99.0s)]
*  If you can call it leading at all. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=102.0s)]
*  In the press, they refuse to hold him accountable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=105.0s)]
*  Check out the temperature in the White House briefing room this week. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=107.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=111.0s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=113.0s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=114.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=116.0s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=117.0s)]
*  Don't say things don't get exciting in here sometimes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=119.0s)]
*  I really, there's no introduction that really is needed here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=122.0s)]
*  I have a special guest, as you can see. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=126.0s)]
*  Mark Hamill has decided to join us on this wonderful Friday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=128.0s)]
*  All right, geez. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=133.0s)]
*  Weijia is not happy about Mark Hamill being here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=134.0s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm not going to tell him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=137.0s)]
*  He's not watching probably. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=138.0s)]
*  I won't tell him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=139.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=141.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the movies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=142.0s)]
*  Do you not like Star Wars? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=144.0s)]
*  You have not seen Star Wars? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=146.0s)]
*  I will now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=148.0s)]
*  I will now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=149.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=150.0s)]
*  That's why that happened, folks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=152.0s)]
*  That's why I got the question. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=154.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=156.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=158.0s)]
*  I'm going to watch. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm going to watch. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=161.0s)]
*  Laughing, joking. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=162.0s)]
*  It's just a conversation among friends. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=164.0s)]
*  Imagine if the president were Donald Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=166.0s)]
*  Imagine if I were standing behind the podium. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=169.0s)]
*  You'd have Jim Acosta screaming, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=171.0s)]
*  are you going to take the student loans from the anti-Israel protesters? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=173.0s)]
*  John Carl, right on cue. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=176.0s)]
*  Will you withdraw support from any anti-Israel protester? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=178.0s)]
*  And they wouldn't stop until we disavowed the support of every student in the country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=182.0s)]
*  Where is the adversarial press? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=187.0s)]
*  They are committing malpractice as Hamas encampments continue to litter the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=190.0s)]
*  But laugh at your own peril. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=195.0s)]
*  Check out how Americans feel about the anti-Israel protest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=197.0s)]
*  According to a new Morning Consult poll, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=200.0s)]
*  a whopping 76% support a police presence on college campuses, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=202.0s)]
*  while 47% of respondents said they believe colleges should ban the protest. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=207.0s)]
*  That's compared to just 30% who said they did not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHGEaSc3jn0&t=213.0s)]
