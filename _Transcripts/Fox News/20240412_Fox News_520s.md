# Sean Hannity: Biden plans to lie his way into a second term
**Fox News:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8)
*  First tonight, turmoil at home and abroad. Inflation, as we learned all week, is on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=0.0s)]
*  rise up dramatically year over year. The border of Biden is broken. Terrorists are emboldened. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=5.68s)]
*  The world is at war. And the president of this country, your president, Joe, he's taking the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=12.72s)]
*  weekend off yet again. No matter how bad things get, Joe will always make time for long weekends [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=18.64s)]
*  in Delaware or, of course, at the beach. Although he does struggle to carry around his little beach [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=25.12s)]
*  chair. Now, even, of course, as his poll numbers have been declining, rest, relaxation, that is the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=29.84s)]
*  top priority for this, well, cognitively impaired, weak and frail president. Instead of working hard [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=36.24s)]
*  for your vote, Biden plans to lie, smear, slander, besmirch his way into a second term. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=42.24s)]
*  For example, just this week, Joe said that he inherited skyrocketing inflation from Donald [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=48.0s)]
*  Trump. Well, in reality, Joe Biden inherited a historically low inflation rate of 1.4 percent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=53.92s)]
*  And since taking office and printing money and spending money like never before, inflation has [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  jumped nearly 20 percent and it continues to get worse every single solitary month. Inflation is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=68.4s)]
*  now so bad, even over at the conspiracy theory channel, MSDNC, even they have to sound the alarm. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=75.12s)]
*  Take a look. I think he's been absolutely disastrous for the economy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=82.88s)]
*  I agree. Raise your hand if you think President Trump's policies on the economy would be better [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  for your family personally. Raise your hand. All right. So that is everybody. President Biden [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=93.44s)]
*  argues that his economic record has been very good. He said President Trump's was not as good. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Is there anything Joe Biden could do or say between now and the time you vote that would [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  make you feel differently about feeling that his policies would not be as good for your family [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=111.92s)]
*  on the economy or have you pretty much decided that Trump's policies would be better for the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=117.04s)]
*  economy? I mean, I feel like he doesn't even take accountability for what's at all with what's going [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=121.28s)]
*  on in the economy, not even accountability. Like he's in denial that it's happening. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=126.0s)]
*  I think that was on liberal Joe, probably had a heart attack. Now, what you just heard is backed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=131.2s)]
*  up by real data. Renting a single family home, that's up 36 percent. Renting an apartment, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=136.32s)]
*  that's up 23 percent. Mortgage rates are at a 15-year high. You want to buy groceries? Well, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=142.0s)]
*  those prices are up 25 percent. And eating out, that's up 25 percent. Gas prices are now up more [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=149.44s)]
*  than 50 percent since Joe took office. Energy prices are up nearly 30 percent and they are going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=157.04s)]
*  higher, increasing at a rate that is 13 times faster than under Trump and Obama, the last seven, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=163.76s)]
*  eight years. It has never been more expensive to live in our country and it's about to get even [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  worse. In order to buy votes ahead of the election, now Biden just wants to dump more money, your money, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  into the economy with another massive student loan bailout. Oh, another seven billion dollars. How [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=185.2s)]
*  great is that? And according to economists, this multi-billion dollar plan will cause inflation to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=191.12s)]
*  spike even further. In return, well, a small portion of affluent Americans will have some of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=196.56s)]
*  their college and grad school loans repaid. And who are they really being paid by? Hardworking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=203.44s)]
*  Americans, the people that really make this country great, many of whom, well, they went into the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  trades and maybe they didn't go to college. Why did they have to pay off, you know, some sociology [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=216.16s)]
*  tenured professor's student loan? Take a look. I spend my days digging holes, cutting grass, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=222.0s)]
*  and sweating. This is job number two today. I'm breaking my back out here for one reason. I want [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=229.28s)]
*  to pay off some other guy's debt. Biden's plan to pay other people's college loans using my tax [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=236.0s)]
*  dollars is a great idea. Biden's right. You should take my tax dollars to pay off your debts. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=241.36s)]
*  See what's happening here? The Biden administration, they are run by woke, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  Ivy League elitists who have absolutely no connection to the rest of America. I've been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=253.68s)]
*  saying this for a long time. The Democratic Party has become radicalized and they have become the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=259.2s)]
*  party of coastal elites, conservatives, Republicans. They are now the party of working men and women in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=265.12s)]
*  this country. These elites, they grew up in the little bubble. They went to school in the little [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=271.2s)]
*  bubble. They now work in a far left woke bubble that is Washington, D.C. No diversity of thought [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=276.56s)]
*  or perspective whatsoever. And meanwhile, Biden himself, a serial plagiarizer, has never really [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=283.52s)]
*  had any original thoughts, especially now with this cognitive decline. So he just does whatever, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=290.56s)]
*  well, his self-righteous staffers tell him to do. In this case, let's try and get young people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=297.44s)]
*  and buy their votes and pay off their student loans with other people's money. Now, this week, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  more no cards written by his staff telling Joe exactly where to stand, what to say, where to walk, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=307.28s)]
*  and what reporters to call on, along with obviously pre-written answers to questions that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=313.84s)]
*  they just seem to happen to anticipate or expect or colluded on. Anyway, really hard to read from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=320.48s)]
*  the script, but even that was a struggle. Take a look. Look, we have dramatically reduced inflation [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=327.92s)]
*  from 9 percent down to close to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we're better situated than [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=334.16s)]
*  we were when we took office. What we see in our joint support for Ukraine on the face of Russia's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=340.8s)]
*  vicious assault is just outrageous. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=346.32s)]
*  Third, next question. Who do I call on next? Hang on a second. I got my list here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Hang on. I apologize. I'm really of AFP. There are a number of hostages that are being held [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  by Hamas. And just yesterday, we were meeting with the vice president, our national security [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=366.08s)]
*  advisor before that, and our American hostages as well. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=373.44s)]
*  Why didn't everybody holler at once? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=386.24s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden is clearly weak, frail, a cognitive mess, and incompetent, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=388.24s)]
*  and the vultures on his staff, they're using him to enact the most radical, far-left socialist [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=392.48s)]
*  policies this country has ever seen. It is ending up hurting most of you, the American people, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=398.64s)]
*  the people that make this country great. This is why Biden is losing support from so many groups [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=405.36s)]
*  that, well, kind of together are the Democratic coalition, in other words, his base, the voters [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  that Democrats usually depend on. Now, that includes African Americans. According to a Wall [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  Street Journal poll, Biden's support among Black men in battleground states is down a whopping 30%. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=424.16s)]
*  Biden's support among Black women is down 16 points. The New York Times found that Donald [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=430.8s)]
*  Trump now leads Biden among Hispanic voters. This is a group that Biden carried by nearly 60% [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=436.48s)]
*  in 2020. Meanwhile, working-class voters of all races are fleeing the Democratic Party in droves. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? Because inflation is impacting and hurting everybody, but especially people that are now, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=451.36s)]
*  60% of the country, that are living paycheck to paycheck or on a fixed income. And the last thing [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=457.44s)]
*  these hardworking great Americans want to end up doing is to pay off, you know, some Yale [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=463.6s)]
*  sociology professors' grad school loans. But Joe doesn't think of it that way. Why? Because he [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=469.92s)]
*  cares about the coastal elites. Joe doesn't think. He can barely even read or walk at this point. So [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=476.08s)]
*  who's actually making the call? I don't know. There has never been anyone less capable of serving [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=482.88s)]
*  what is the toughest job in the world, being the president of our country, than this guy, Joe Biden. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=490.24s)]
*  And yet he wants another term? America and the world are really on the brink. This is our [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=496.64s)]
*  inflection point as a country in 206 days. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZuSRnMi1v8&t=503.28s)]
