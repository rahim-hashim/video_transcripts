# Donald Trump: Biden is in bad shape
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc)
*  I want to ask you, when prominent Democratic voices like Maureen Dowd and David Axelrod [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=0.0s)]
*  and Van Jones and others are so critical of Joe Biden, and, of course, he is struggling [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=6.4s)]
*  cognitively, I can't think of, in the last couple of months, any appearance that he has [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  had, where he wasn't either mumbling or bumbling or stumbling or having no clue where [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=17.6s)]
*  to go, where to exit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=22.96s)]
*  Now, my question is, do you think in 11 months he will be their candidate? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=24.92s)]
*  I personally don't think he makes it, okay? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  I haven't said that, I'm saving it for this big town hall. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=33.32s)]
*  I personally don't think he makes it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=36.28s)]
*  I think he's in bad shape physically. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=40.2s)]
*  Do you remember when he said, I'd like to take him behind the barn? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  If he took me behind the barn and I went like this, I believe he'd fall over. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  I believe he'd fall over. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=52.28s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=53.28s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=54.28s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=55.28s)]
*  But it was okay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=56.28s)]
*  And by the way, it was okay for him to say that he's hard luck to take him behind the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=58.68s)]
*  barn. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  He could say that and everyone thought it was so cute. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  If I ever said it, they'd say, he's a dictator, he's a horrible human being. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=64.8s)]
*  You know, it's a whole double standard we have, and not only in the law, but just about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=69.8s)]
*  everything else, as you know very well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=73.44s)]
*  I personally don't think he makes it physically. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=76.0s)]
*  I watched him at the beach, he wasn't able to lift a beach chair, which is meant for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=78.84s)]
*  children to lift. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=82.08s)]
*  They could lift him like that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=83.08s)]
*  And mentally, I would say he's possibly equally as bad and maybe worse. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=85.28s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=90.2s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=91.2s)]
*  He's got vicious people surrounding him around that beautiful oval office. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=92.24s)]
*  There are people in that oval office that are evil people, bad people, smart people, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=96.84s)]
*  young, vicious. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=102.2s)]
*  They're communists and they're bad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=104.36s)]
*  Who do you think would replace him then? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=106.96s)]
*  Well, I saw one person on who I actually had a very good relationship with, but I'm sure [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  that it would end very quickly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=114.36s)]
*  I saw him in your debate the other night and he's slick, but he's got no facts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=116.0s)]
*  You know, he's got no facts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  I thought he did well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=121.56s)]
*  Considering... [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=122.56s)]
*  You're talking about Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=123.56s)]
*  Yeah, considering that he didn't have the facts, I thought he did well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=124.56s)]
*  You know, he said, we have the lowest taxes in the country, we have the cleanest streets [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=128.72s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=132.76s)]
*  We have... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=133.76s)]
*  And I'm saying, wait a minute, is he talking about the same place? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=134.76s)]
*  So he'd certainly be one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=137.92s)]
*  I guess they say that Kamala would be the one, the odds to be. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=139.04s)]
*  Because they say if they didn't give it to her, the African American vote, the black [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=147.28s)]
*  vote would not go to them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=151.84s)]
*  And we just had a poll where I'm at 22 and 25 percent with the black vote. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=154.12s)]
*  If we have that, we can call the election over. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=157.72s)]
*  We've got to take a break. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=160.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_goB8ydQc&t=161.04s)]
