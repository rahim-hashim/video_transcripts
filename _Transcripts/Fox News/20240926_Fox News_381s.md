# Newt Gingrich: Kamala Harris isn't telling the truth
**Fox News:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU)
*  Anyway, joining us now is former Speaker of the House, Newt Kingrich is with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=0.0s)]
*  with just 40 days to go. Mr. Speaker, it's great to have you, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=4.26s)]
*  Good to be with you. I have to say, by the way, I couldn't help but think [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=8.84s)]
*  when you went through Holistically a couple times, the Trump campaign should [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=14.82s)]
*  probably issue a t-shirt that says Holistically Stupid, and that would sort [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=19.46s)]
*  capture the whole Kamala Harris campaign. By the way, you better do that quick [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=26.42s)]
*  because capitalism, as we know it, is going to be dead if she ever wins the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  White House. We're all in trouble. I know you have been extremely consistently [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=35.14s)]
*  confident that that she will be exposed for the radicals that she is. I've been [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=40.78s)]
*  trying hard now for two months. I do believe it's beginning to enter the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=47.42s)]
*  consciousness of the American people, but early voting has started, and I'm [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=50.66s)]
*  not sure everybody knows, and I think if they did know, they'd never vote for her. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=55.7s)]
*  So I think that's part of the message. Why do you still remain so confident [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  when the polls look so close? Well, I think, first of all, that Trump in the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=65.38s)]
*  last two elections actually outperformed the polls because the news media, the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=73.14s)]
*  propaganda media, as I would call it, is so hostile that there are a number of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  people for Trump who won't say it, and he's consistently pulled ahead of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=82.46s)]
*  actual polls. Second, I do think if you look at the data that it's beginning to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  sink in that she is, first of all, not telling us the truth, so it becomes a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=92.86s)]
*  character issue. It's sinking in that when you ask people, were you better off, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  you know, she now has the worst support in the black community among black men [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  of any Democratic candidate at least since 1956. So even though you'd think [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=109.22s)]
*  she would have some ethnic appeal, young black males are saying, no, this ain't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=115.9s)]
*  working. You know, I can't go to the grocery store. I can't buy gasoline. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=120.06s)]
*  The city's unsafe. I now see illegal immigrants taking away my job, and you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=125.02s)]
*  see a lot of this stuff going on. So I just, I'm pretty confident that in the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=131.88s)]
*  end, people are going to decide that four years of her on top of four years [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=137.46s)]
*  of Biden would both cripple the country permanently and would be a nightmare, and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=144.18s)]
*  in a dangerous world where you have a war in Ukraine, you have a war between [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=149.58s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah and Hamas and Iran, you have a threat of a war in Taiwan, do [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=156.3s)]
*  you really believe she could be a commander-in-chief? And I think on that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=162.02s)]
*  test, she just loses badly. You know, I remember, I was the emcee of your event [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=166.7s)]
*  at the Cobb Galleria in November 1994, the night you became speaker. I saw you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  earlier in the day, and I got a chance to talk to you, and I said, how do you feel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  about your chances tonight? You were 100% confident. I think you came within two [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=187.06s)]
*  seats, if I'm not mistaken, of actually getting where this would end up. We're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=192.22s)]
*  40 days out of the election. We have a different election system now, because [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=199.42s)]
*  people vote early. It seems that they vote in perpetuity. As we look at this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=202.9s)]
*  night, 40 days outside of this election, where do you see this landing? And that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=208.18s)]
*  would be for the presidency, the House, the Senate. Well, let me say, first of all, it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=213.94s)]
*  was Joe Gaylord, who on September 17th, 1994, correctly predicted within one [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=220.02s)]
*  seat, literally exactly the seats we'd carry. We gained one more. None of us [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  thought we could beat Rostinkowski in downtown Chicago, and we did. Let me also [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  say that tomorrow, I'm thrilled that Congressman Todd Tehart has actually [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=235.62s)]
*  brought all the people together again. It's the 30th anniversary of unveiling [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  the contract with America, and we're going to celebrate it at the Capitol [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=244.34s)]
*  tomorrow with Speaker Johnson. So it's a very historic moment and one that I [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=247.94s)]
*  really look forward to. If I had to make a guess, and let me emphasize guess, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=251.94s)]
*  because I'll tell you, I was in the White House election night 2020, and up until [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=257.58s)]
*  midnight we were winning. And then all of a sudden, state after state quit [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=265.22s)]
*  counting votes. And I had a very deep, sick feeling that it was all going to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=269.7s)]
*  much harder than we thought it would be. So I would start and say, unless they can [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=275.02s)]
*  steal enough votes in Philadelphia to offset the African-American males they're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  going to lose, they're almost certainly going to lose Pennsylvania, partly because [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  of fracking in the West, partly because people are just tired of it. I think that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  they're very likely to lose Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona. I just recently had [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=296.78s)]
*  dinner with the Nevada Chamber of Commerce, and virtually every one of them [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=303.18s)]
*  thought that Trump would carry Nevada. So now you come down to Michigan and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=306.54s)]
*  Wisconsin. In Michigan, you now had a Democratic mayor, a Muslim, who announced [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  publicly he was endorsing Trump because he thought that the Biden-Harris [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=318.94s)]
*  team was so dishonest and so incompetent that he just couldn't continue to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=325.66s)]
*  support them. Those kind of breaks are happening all over the place. I think [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=332.06s)]
*  they're going to keep happening. You've had a former state Senate majority leader [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=336.7s)]
*  and a current state senator leave the Democratic Party in California. When you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=340.9s)]
*  turn around state after state, you see an attrition towards us. Gallup came out the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  other day and said that we're now three points ahead on identity in a poll that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=351.18s)]
*  they've done every four years, which has consistently been accurate. And I think [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=357.42s)]
*  Gallup believes that Trump will in fact win. All right, we appreciate it. Speaker [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=362.86s)]
*  Newk Ingrich. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj0DLyyBvU&t=368.22s)]
