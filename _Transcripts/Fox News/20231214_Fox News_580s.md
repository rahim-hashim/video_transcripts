# Hannity: Bidenâ€™s White House is in panic mode
**Fox News:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA)
*  But first, fear and loathing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, a new political report now claiming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=0.0s)]
*  that Biden is frustrated and anxious and mad about his son's legal woes, even lashing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=7.24s)]
*  out at White House aides, blasting even his own AG, Merrick Garland, for allowing his [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=12.92s)]
*  son to be charged with a crime. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=18.6s)]
*  There is also deep panic surrounding the president's looming impeachment inquiry. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=20.6s)]
*  In a rant purportedly written by Joe Biden, the president is accusing Republicans of quote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=25.28s)]
*  attacking me with lies instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=31.32s)]
*  They are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, apparently, House Republicans struck a nerve, including right here on this program [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=41.88s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=47.64s)]
*  You got this Biden snake-like spokesperson, Ian Sams is his name. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=48.64s)]
*  I don't know, apparently he works in the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=55.0s)]
*  Apparently he's a spokesperson of some kind. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=58.24s)]
*  But also he was very busy last night reacting to this show and at one point tweeting out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=60.72s)]
*  that quote, House Republican leaders, again I quote, aren't pursuing anything real. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=67.12s)]
*  They are just using it as a political stunt to go to places like Hannity to relentlessly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=72.76s)]
*  attack a good and honorable man with lies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=78.12s)]
*  Okay, Mr. Sams, you mean the good, honorable man, the one that wouldn't acknowledge his [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  own granddaughter for years, his son wouldn't acknowledge his own daughter for a long period [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=87.12s)]
*  of time? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=92.2s)]
*  You might want to explain to us, Mr. Sams, exactly what services that zero experience [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  hunter rendered to be paid millions and millions of dollars from a Ukrainian and a Chinese [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=99.68s)]
*  both companies, when he admitted himself in his own words that he had no experience in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  energy at all at the time, that he was also struggling with very serious addiction issues. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=113.2s)]
*  Why would a vice president of our country, our great country, why would a vice president [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  leverage one billion taxpayer dollars, Mr. Sams, to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  Does that seem odd to you? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=130.6s)]
*  That action, by the way, resulted in his inexperienced son being paid even more money for a business [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=132.32s)]
*  that he had no experience in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=139.16s)]
*  Why would Hunter Biden be threatening a Chinese business partner on a WhatsApp message with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  retribution from his father and everybody he knows and his ability to hold a grudge [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=146.78s)]
*  if they didn't get paid? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=154.12s)]
*  Was he sitting with his father at the time of the message? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=156.76s)]
*  That's what the message actually says. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=160.12s)]
*  And why did Joe Biden lie repeatedly when he said over and over and over again that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=162.48s)]
*  he never one time ever discussed his foreign business deals with Hunter, his brother or [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=166.88s)]
*  anybody for that matter? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=173.28s)]
*  Would you now acknowledge, Mr. Sams, that that is a lie? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=174.8s)]
*  There is now photographic evidence that Joe Biden met with Hunter and his foreign business [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=178.76s)]
*  partners and testimony that Joe Biden was on the phone with at least 20 calls with Hunter [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=183.88000000000002s)]
*  and his foreign business partners. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=191.96s)]
*  Oh, did Joe lie? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=193.4s)]
*  Lastly, I have a really important question. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Is Joe Biden the big guy, as Tony Bobolinski has told us? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=198.08s)]
*  Now, when you, Mr. Sams, when you answer these simple questions, I've got a hundred more. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=202.52s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=208.0s)]
*  We invited you on the program tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=209.0s)]
*  We got no response. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=210.56s)]
*  So, Mr. Sams, let me extend an invitation again very publicly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=212.2s)]
*  You can come on my radio show and 735 of the greatest radio stations in the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=217.16s)]
*  I'll give you the full three hours to be my guest. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=223.28s)]
*  And as a bonus, you can come on this TV show. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=226.44s)]
*  I will give you a full hour instead of you just hiding behind your desk at the Biden [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=229.64s)]
*  White House, sending out your little tweets on X. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=235.4s)]
*  Now, of course, Ian Sams is more than happy to take softball questions on his favorite [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  networks like fake news CNN. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=244.56s)]
*  He's been on MSDNC. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  You're welcome here, Mr. Sams. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  Come on for the full hour. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=250.28s)]
*  I have a list of questions that I really, really would like to ask you and hear your [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=251.52s)]
*  answers on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=255.96s)]
*  But take a look. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  So they're just making up lies to attack the president in a relentless smear campaign that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=258.88s)]
*  frankly has been going on for four straight years now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=264.36s)]
*  We've been extremely clear over and over again for years and nothing has changed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=267.68s)]
*  The president was not in business with his son, period. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=271.36s)]
*  They're trying to make up all sorts of allegations and make up lies. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  Ian, with respect, I'm not citing Jim Jordan here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=277.36s)]
*  I was in some of the White House press briefings where it was said explicitly the president [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=279.28s)]
*  did not talk to his son about business deal. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=282.8s)]
*  That is very clearly not the case. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think the statement from the White House has changed and I think been a little bit [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=287.68s)]
*  more precise over the course of the last several months. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=291.08s)]
*  It's what the president said on the campaign trail as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=293.76s)]
*  I'm not saying this is like an impeachable offense or some grand indictment, but it is [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  a fact that the president said one thing that ended up being not true. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  Again, I dispute that that's true. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=308.12s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  The truth is that he wasn't in business with his son. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=311.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=313.32s)]
*  It is sad to see someone make a fool out of themselves on national TV. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=314.32s)]
*  Now this Ian Sam's person is either living in a fantasy world or just lying to your face. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=318.16s)]
*  But the American people, you have a choice. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=323.98s)]
*  You can believe a quivering, no name partisan hack, or you can put your trust in two nonpartisan [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=326.8s)]
*  government whistleblowers, one a Democrat with nothing to gain and everything to lose. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=333.2s)]
*  And today, by the way, those two IRS whistleblowers said that there was ample evidence to show [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  that your president, Joe Biden, was involved in his son's business deals. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=344.4s)]
*  Take a look for yourself. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=349.36s)]
*  At the beginning, it was I've never talked to my son about business. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=350.36s)]
*  It's been proven patently false by evidence and testimony we provided. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=355.16s)]
*  Then it moved to he's not in business with him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=360.12s)]
*  And now we're into he's not financially connected to the businesses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=362.56s)]
*  So you don't have to be financially connected to a business in order to be a part of that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=366.48s)]
*  business. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=373.16s)]
*  And what President Biden was basically doing through Hunter Biden was allowing Hunter Biden [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=374.16s)]
*  to get these deals where there's no discernible actual product being produced. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=379.96s)]
*  So it's really just a peddling of the influence. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, again, these two IRS investigators, they risked everything to come forward. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Their claims about Hunter's alleged crimes were just proven true by a federal indictment. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=394.2s)]
*  And their new claims about Joe Biden's involvement in the Biden family business. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=400.2s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=404.36s)]
*  They're backed up with pictures, eyewitness testimony. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=405.36s)]
*  They are backed up by suspicious activity reports, allegations from credible government [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=408.88s)]
*  source detailed in that FBI 1023 form, along with phone records and texts and emails and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=414.32s)]
*  even a handwritten note. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=421.08s)]
*  Well, on the other side, you have Joe Biden, who wants you to just simply trust him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=422.88s)]
*  Now, Joe has previously lied about, let's see, his past employment, his grades in law [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=427.96s)]
*  school, his trips on Amtrak, the death of his own son, his actions after 9-11, his role [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=433.0s)]
*  in the civil rights movement, his non-existent arrest in South Africa, his house getting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=439.8s)]
*  destroyed by a fire. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=445.32s)]
*  That wasn't true. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=447.4s)]
*  His totally secure southern border and the number of even grandchildren he has in his [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=448.62s)]
*  own family. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=453.96s)]
*  And again, Biden also, well, definitely lied when he said he never, ever once interacted [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=455.2s)]
*  with Hunter or his brother or any of their foreign business partners. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=461.3s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the Biden family bag man, Hunter, is also deeply dishonest. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree like father, like son. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=471.2s)]
*  Hunter is now federally accused of lying on his taxes, lying about deductions, lying on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=475.64s)]
*  a gun application. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=480.68s)]
*  But we're all, what, supposed to believe that the millions that he was making from [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdK2S9-rSPA&t=481.68s)]
