# Impeachment inquiry heats up after bombshell testimony from ex-Biden associate
**Fox News:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw)
*  Here now with reaction Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett along with Harvard law professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know if you want to even be called the Harvard law professor anymore Alan Dershowitz [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=5.32s)]
*  I might say Hannity just introduced me as Alan Dershowitz [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=9.38s)]
*  I don't want to be associated with that place anymore, but that's up to you. Let me know [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=14.36s)]
*  I'm a meritist which means I'm a meritist that means formally of Harvard Law School now on my own [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=18.0s)]
*  You're on your own [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=25.34s)]
*  Let's look at the big picture of what Joe Biden is facing here legally and also compare it contrasted to what the president is facing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=27.7s)]
*  This this immunity issue and whether it's going to be taken up by the Supreme Court is critical professor will start with you [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=36.34s)]
*  Well, there's so much hypocrisy going around they're now trying to impeach Joe Biden based on what he did as vice president now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=44.7s)]
*  Remember that in the past the shoe was on the other foot and that is was the Democrats [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=53.1s)]
*  Who were saying no you can't you can impeach you can impeach a president when he's no longer president the second [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=59.98s)]
*  Second Trump impeachment [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  So the the big issue in that case is can a person be impeached for what he did when he was vice president now that he's president [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=70.5s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that but the sides have shifted on that now since the target is no longer Donald Trump [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=78.42s)]
*  And the target instead is Joe Biden [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=86.14s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see whether or not that works out the same thing is true [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  By the way with the Majorca's impeachment the the the same people who used to say oh you need high crimes and misdemeanors [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=93.5s)]
*  And and crimes like treason and bribery are now saying no no, no, it's okay [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=101.54s)]
*  If it's an abuse of office, whereas the other side who was saying it used to say [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=106.98s)]
*  That you can have broad broad criteria like abuse of power and and obstruction of Congress and now saying no, no, no [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=112.34s)]
*  No, it has to be specific [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  So there's so much hypocrisy and that always happens when either side [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=121.26s)]
*  Weaponizes the criminal justice system and the Constitution and the loser is the American public [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=125.86s)]
*  You know the interesting part Greg and the professor's right this question now whether the Supreme Court will take up the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=131.82s)]
*  Immunity case this could very well affect Joe Biden. You can't indict a sitting president [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=138.34s)]
*  Most people agree with that that has been DOJ policy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=142.78s)]
*  However, if in fact Joe Biden as vice president took official actions that benefited his family members [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=146.18s)]
*  You have said that fits within the bribery statute. That would be the crime of bribery [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=153.98s)]
*  That would mean when Joe leaves office [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=161.06s)]
*  Executive privilege in that immunity from when he was vice president, does he? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=163.06s)]
*  Right that that is correct and you know, look it is a crime [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=169.5s)]
*  Under the bribery statutes. It's an impeachable offense known as bribery in the Constitution [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=174.3s)]
*  I'm against the ideas, you know of impeaching a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=182.02s)]
*  President during an election year that's election interference in my judgment trying to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  Disenfranchise the voters. They should have the say on this now having said all of that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=191.7s)]
*  Conferring using your public office to confer a benefit in exchange for money to yourself or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=198.38s)]
*  Your family the money doesn't have to go to you is a crime and it's an impeachable offense [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=205.5s)]
*  And so, you know, are there grounds for impeachment here? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=212.06s)]
*  Absolutely. I think the impeachment inquiry [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=216.7s)]
*  continues to develop really critical evidence of the influence peddling schemes that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=220.94s)]
*  Hunter Biden was in charge of but Joe Biden was intimately involved as John Solomon just explained [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=227.78s)]
*  They were selling the Biden brand the brand [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=234.78s)]
*  was access and promises of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=238.02s)]
*  influence from Joe Biden and the promise alone [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=241.34s)]
*  Sustains a criminal charge [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=245.54s)]
*  Exit question. Yes or no answer. I don't have the time. Will the Supreme Court take up the immunity issue? I believe they should [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=248.38s)]
*  professor I [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=256.82s)]
*  Believe they should and I believe they won't until after there is if there is a conviction [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=259.3s)]
*  I think they'll punt on that one. I think they will take up some of these other issues. However, right [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=265.06s)]
*  Yes or no [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=270.66s)]
*  They should now but they won't now but they will take it up later in the event of a conviction [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  That's right. You are both correct. I agree with both of you. All right, you get an A-plus professor good for you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=278.46000000000004s)]
*  Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lA6pmXwYw&t=283.90000000000003s)]
