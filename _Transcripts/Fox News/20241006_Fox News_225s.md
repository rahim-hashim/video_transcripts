# Sara Carter: People’s livelihoods were washed away
**Fox News:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU)
*  Now, yesterday, Arronne Sara Carter was in Asheville, in North Carolina, one of the hardest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=0.0s)]
*  hit areas, seeing the damage up close and personal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=4.32s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  She's live in New Jersey, where an agreement was reached with dockworkers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=8.68s)]
*  Let's go back to Asheville. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=12.24s)]
*  And I know you're going back to North Carolina tomorrow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=13.68s)]
*  You saw some of the hardest hit areas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=17.16s)]
*  You also talked to a lot of people on the ground that have lost everything. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=19.22s)]
*  And the one theme that I'm hearing from my radio audience is that there's not a single [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=24.32s)]
*  FEMA emergency management person, not one, that they have seen up to this point. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Did you see any or anybody that you had a chance to talk to? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=36.16s)]
*  Did they tell you they saw anybody? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=40.68s)]
*  Actually, Sean, no, we didn't see anybody from FEMA. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=42.92s)]
*  We didn't see anybody from the government. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=47.28s)]
*  We're here in Port Elizabeth tonight, here in New Jersey, because we were deeply concerned [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=48.96s)]
*  about the victims of Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=55.16s)]
*  We were wondering what this strike would do to them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=57.76s)]
*  And while I was there in Asheville yesterday talking to residents, I could tell you the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  devastation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=64.8s)]
*  There is nothing quite like seeing it in person. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=66.32s)]
*  I mean, pictures on television don't even do it justice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=68.64s)]
*  We saw homes that were completely covered in mud. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=72.44s)]
*  We saw people's livelihoods just washed away, businesses that were underwater, that were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=75.84s)]
*  under mud, that the products inside their businesses, they're no longer existent. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  There were people up in the mountains in the surrounding areas outside of Asheville, Sean, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=88.52s)]
*  that couldn't even communicate with people below. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=93.28s)]
*  The last time some family members heard from any of their family up in the mountains was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=96.52s)]
*  over five days ago. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=101.0s)]
*  Some people are saying that it was so bad that people that they did communicate with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=102.84s)]
*  said they could actually smell, smell the corpses underneath the mudslides because people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  are still missing and bodies still need to be recovered. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=114.86s)]
*  We saw that Congressman Cory Mills, incredible work trying to fly food and medicine into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=118.3s)]
*  people that were out of reach because the government is not there for them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=124.94s)]
*  I had people crying in my arms because they felt that the government had abandoned them, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=129.26s)]
*  that Kamala Harris, the vice president, that President Biden had abandoned them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=134.94000000000003s)]
*  They feel alone. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=139.82000000000002s)]
*  They don't know what they're going to do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=141.5s)]
*  There were people that I interviewed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=142.94000000000003s)]
*  Samaritan's Purse was in fact the only group other than other citizens in the area that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=144.38000000000002s)]
*  were actually helping victims, that were actually helping victims with their homes trying to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=150.58s)]
*  get a large trees cut down out of the way of the home, contacting, bringing food and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  water to people that were trapped because the roads had been closed off. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=162.18s)]
*  Some of the roads had actually been washed away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=167.46s)]
*  In fact, our team got trapped in mud for a short period while we were reporting there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=169.94s)]
*  and it was incredible. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=176.14s)]
*  Somebody came out of their home down the hill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=178.18s)]
*  They had been up there for the last five days without electricity, without any water, you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=181.22s)]
*  know, with just what people had been able to bring up to them and they helped us get [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=186.42s)]
*  out of the mud. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=191.10000000000002s)]
*  Sean, I've got to tell you, I've never ever seen anything like this and I think what was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  more gut wrenching is the fact that these Americans are not getting the help that they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=196.38000000000002s)]
*  need from the government and they're asking for that help and they're not receiving it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=201.5s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  Great reporting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=208.3s)]
*  Sarah will be back in North Carolina tomorrow. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=209.3s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  Joining us now, Samaritan's Purse. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEhMEsgnEU&t=212.16000000000003s)]
