# Hannity: Hunter Biden caves
**Fox News:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0)
*  In case you have not noticed, President Biden spent most of the week resting and recovering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=0.0s)]
*  after a quick trip to South Carolina and Texas on Monday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=4.8s)]
*  But today, he's back in action. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=9.0s)]
*  Good for Joe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=10.8s)]
*  After finally mustering the energy to meet with voters in Pennsylvania, this time his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=11.96s)]
*  focus was on, once again, we thought it was dead, he's bringing back Bidenomics. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=16.48s)]
*  Now, of course, he didn't have much to say, because there's very little good news on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=21.36s)]
*  the economy to share. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=25.44s)]
*  In fact, the most recent inflation report was even worse than expected. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  Now, we'll bring you the lowlights straight ahead. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=30.72s)]
*  But now we turn to the president's adult son, zero experience Hunter, who is once again [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  asking for special treatment after allegedly now failing to pay taxes on what is millions [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=39.92s)]
*  of dollars in income, money he purportedly acquired by selling access to the federal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=46.04s)]
*  government through the Biden brand. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=51.44s)]
*  We need Washington help, as the Bereastman executive said. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=54.36s)]
*  Hunter is now determined to waste even more time and resources at the taxpayer's expense. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=58.16s)]
*  Now, first, he refused to comply with the legally binding congressional subpoena. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=63.6s)]
*  Now, you might remember President Trump's children, they complied with multiple subpoenas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=67.8s)]
*  from House Democrats, not Hunter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=73.4s)]
*  He believes, I guess, he deserves special treatment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=75.98s)]
*  And then, of course, the big stunt, Hunter showing up at his own contempt hearing with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=78.72s)]
*  his own camera crew in tow and the president's son apparently trying to make a clown show [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=83.4s)]
*  out of what was a serious official proceeding to film content for his upcoming documentary [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=88.96s)]
*  in the hopes, I guess, of making even more money. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=94.6s)]
*  But now that the president's entitled son is facing a real possibility of contempt of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=97.36s)]
*  Congress charges, well, Hunter wants a do-over and is now demanding that the House issue [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=102.88s)]
*  a brand new subpoena that he can accept. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=107.9s)]
*  And by the way, Hunter's attorneys even suggested possible terms for the new subpoena. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  Hunter is playing games with the People's House in order to drag this out as long as [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  possible. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=121.94s)]
*  He has had no respect for this ongoing investigation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=122.94s)]
*  He's had no respect for the rule of law, and neither has his father, the big guy, Joe. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=126.05999999999999s)]
*  Now, you would think during an election year the Bidens might want to quickly clear their [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=131.34s)]
*  good name if they have one, if they truly have done nothing wrong and have nothing to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  hide, they would want to answer questions from members of Congress. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, that wouldn't be a problem, would it, if you didn't do anything wrong, if his father [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=145.26s)]
*  didn't leverage a billion dollars, taxpayer dollars, to get a prosecutor fired so that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=149.46s)]
*  his son, who admits he had no experience in energy or Ukraine, was being paid millions [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=154.7s)]
*  at a time when he was addicted to drugs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=160.46s)]
*  But given the constant lies, the constant obstruction from both Joe and Hunter, it is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=162.78s)]
*  a contempt of Congress charge is the least of their worries. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  There is certainly no guarantee that Hunter will ever comply with the House subpoena anyway, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  and today I think that law professor Jonathan Terrely nailed it, and he put out a piece [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=177.38s)]
*  of advice to Republican lawmakers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  The response to Hunter by the House should be short and should be simple. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=186.17999999999998s)]
*  Toying with Congress may have had recreational and political appeal, but it also has legal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  costs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  Hunter may be the president's son, but he does not get a mulligan on contempt. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=197.94s)]
*  In a joint statement, House Chairman Comer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jordan said [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  they will allow Hunter to comply with the original subpoena, but in the meantime, the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=208.06s)]
*  House will proceed with their contempt resolution. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, for most Americans, there are no legal mulligans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=215.5s)]
*  If you try to defraud the federal government for years and not pay your taxes, guess what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  You don't get a do-over when you get caught. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=225.82s)]
*  If you lie on a gun application and then, oh, your gun ends up in a trash can near a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=228.22s)]
*  school, well, you're not going to get sympathy from any federal prosecutor. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=233.82s)]
*  Now, if your name is Paul Manafort and you fail to register under FARA laws, well, the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=238.22s)]
*  Washington Field Office or the FBI, we now know they're not going to look the other way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=243.5s)]
*  So why should it be any different for Hunter Biden? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=248.42s)]
*  Now, why does he deserve special treatment? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=251.34s)]
*  Why has he been given so much special treatment? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=253.74s)]
*  Why did David Weiss allow the statute of limitations to expire on so many serious tax violations? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=257.26s)]
*  They just happened to coincide with the Burisma earning years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=265.38s)]
*  Why did the DOJ attempt to sweep all of Hunter Biden's crimes under the rug? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=269.42s)]
*  Remember, Weiss originally, his plan A was not to charge Hunter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=274.22s)]
*  And then, of course, the whistleblowers came out and he had no choice, so they went to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=277.94s)]
*  plan B. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=281.42s)]
*  That was the sweetheart deal. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, that got blown up by a judge in Delaware that actually had the wherewithal to read [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=283.94s)]
*  the agreement and ask the defense team, have you ever seen an agreement like this before? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=290.42s)]
*  No, Your Honor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=295.3s)]
*  Then why are you handing this to me? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=296.66s)]
*  And that has now resulted in a special counsel, but it's still the same guy that didn't want [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  to charge Hunter in the first place. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=303.5s)]
*  The federal government is so deeply biased and corrupt, it should make every American [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=305.56s)]
*  sick. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=312.16s)]
*  This is what we talk about when we talk about whether or not the DOJ has been weaponized [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=313.16s)]
*  and politicized and the FBI weaponized and politicized as Hunter Biden now faces felony [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=317.2s)]
*  charges for skipping out on over a million dollars in taxes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=323.16s)]
*  Now his father bragged about making Americans pay their fair share, quote unquote. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=327.64s)]
*  As of today, the IRS has collected over 500 million in unpaid taxes from 1600 millionaires [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=333.4s)]
*  using resources from my Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=340.88s)]
*  Well, this is about the super wealthy needing to pay what they owe and what the existing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=344.12s)]
*  tax code calls for, just like hardworking Americans do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=350.64s)]
*  Is he going to give that lecture to his son Hunter? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Because they made millions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  He had no experience. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=359.2s)]
*  He was addicted to drugs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1-Mrwy6kp0&t=360.84s)]
