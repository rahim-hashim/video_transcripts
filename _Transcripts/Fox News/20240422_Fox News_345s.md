# Trump legal spokesperson: You can't make this up
**Fox News:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts)
*  This is a Fox News alert. We are continuing to monitor police trying to clear protesters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=0.0s)]
*  from around NYU campus in New York City. Also tonight, our other top story, the weaponization [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=5.3s)]
*  of our system of justice against Donald Trump, that continues. Earlier today, before entering [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=11.9s)]
*  the courtroom, he did speak to reporters blasting the left for their latest witch hunt. Here's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=16.94s)]
*  what he said. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=22.62s)]
*  They take this payment and they call it a legal expense, and you heard it today for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=23.62s)]
*  the first time. This is what I got indicted over. This is what took me off and takes me [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=29.1s)]
*  off the campaign trail because I should be in Georgia now. I should be in Florida now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=34.1s)]
*  I should be in a lot of different places right now campaigning and I'm sitting here. And [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=39.1s)]
*  this will go on for a long time. It's very unfair. The judges get flicked in as you know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=44.1s)]
*  It's very unfair what's going on. And I should be allowed to campaign. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=49.1s)]
*  Now, following his remarks, this ridiculous Alvin Bragg trial began with opening statements [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=55.1s)]
*  before adjourning for the day early due to Passover. By the way, the guy that did opening [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=60.34s)]
*  arguments for the DA, yeah, happened to come from Joe Biden's Justice Department. He just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=66.9s)]
*  happened to move over because he was obsessed with the case. Meanwhile, radical New York [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=72.9s)]
*  attorney general Letitia James suffered another blow in her civil fraud case after the judge [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=77.12s)]
*  denied her request to invalidate Trump's $175 million bond that he posted while he is waiting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=83.22s)]
*  for appeal. Here with reaction, Trump legal spokesperson Alina Haber and Trump 2024, National [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=90.5s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. They were both in the courtroom today. Alina, on the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=96.78s)]
*  $175 million, I found this interesting. My understanding is that the judge in the case [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=101.58s)]
*  said, Well, what happens if the $175 million isn't there at the time it would be necessary [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=106.74s)]
*  to make that payment? And the Trump people said, Oh, that would be in cash, sir. He said, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=114.58s)]
*  But what if it's not worth the same amount of money? That would be in cash, sir. $175 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=120.82s)]
*  million is $175 million. Please tell me that didn't happen. Did that happen in that courtroom? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=126.82s)]
*  You're laughing, so I guess the answer is yes. You have no idea. We had the money in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=131.7s)]
*  a Charles Schwab money market account, and the judge legitimately said with a straight [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  face with his little team, Hey, I don't think this is secure money because something could [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  happen to the market and it could go below $175 million. To tell you how hard it was [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  for me to keep my face straight in that moment. Sean, you can't make it up. This case should [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=156.22s)]
*  have been in the commercial division. It had no business being in the civil division in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  front of a judge that today was trying to invalidate any bond and doesn't understand [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=167.1s)]
*  that cash is green. And when cash is held by Charles Schwab, they can't go trade it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=171.82s)]
*  They can't move it around. It's not the stock market. But he didn't understand basics. It [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=177.1s)]
*  was one of those aha moments that I truly didn't feel I could have after 11 weeks in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=182.9s)]
*  front of this judge. But it just can't stop. He can't stop surprising me. By the way, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=187.46s)]
*  it was a disgrace to be honest. And then after that, I went to the criminal hearing, which [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=192.5s)]
*  is another disgrace. Okay. And let's be fair. This is the same guy that thinks Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=195.94s)]
*  a billion dollar Palm Beach property, $100 million Palm Beach property is worth $18 million. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=202.46s)]
*  The whole case is about quote valuations that had a disclaimer said don't go by our [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=208.64s)]
*  valuations. All right, Caroline, you were in the courtroom today to your observations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=213.55999999999997s)]
*  Well, I will say, Sean, like millions of your viewers, I consider myself to be a proud American. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=217.76s)]
*  But after sitting in that dirty, disgusting criminal courtroom today, watching the former [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=224.16s)]
*  president of the United States being persecuted like a criminal, I don't know if I'm so proud [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=229.56s)]
*  to be an American anymore. Meanwhile, there are real criminals running free in the streets [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=234.76s)]
*  of this city every single day being released by the same Democrat prosecutor who is going [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=239.84s)]
*  after President Trump. It is a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars. It's a tremendous [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=245.84s)]
*  waste of time. And as I was exiting the courtroom today, I stopped by a New York police officer [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  who was forced to stand guard and protect the courthouse. And you know what he said? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  He said, I am so sorry you guys have to be here. And I looked at him and I said, I am [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=259.52s)]
*  sorry you have to be here because there is no crime that brought this case to this courtroom. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  It would have been laughed out of any other courtroom in America if not being brought by [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=268.36s)]
*  far left district attorney Alvin Bragg, overseen by a Democrat judge who donated money to Joe [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden's campaign. And let's not forget why this case is being led. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  It's because we have a Democrat president in the White House in Joe Biden, who is concocting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=281.12s)]
*  all of these Biden trials behind the scenes in an attempt to interfere in this election [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=286.16s)]
*  and weaken his political opposition. This is what we see in Banana Republic's third [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=290.96s)]
*  world countries, not the United States of America. But unfortunately for the Democrats, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=295.76s)]
*  Sean, it is backfiring on them because President Trump is tough and he's tenacious and he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=299.76s)]
*  continues to increase his support in the polls. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=304.2s)]
*  Alina, the next time you're in, judging in Goran's presence, we do me a favor. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  We please show him the price of a two acre empty lot, a dirt lot in Palm Beach that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=312.88s)]
*  is now for sale for $200 million. And maybe that'll give him some perspective about what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=319.96s)]
*  the true value of Mar-a-Lago is. But anyway, thank you both. We appreciate it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=325.96s)]
*  Alina, thank you. Caroline, thank you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wdbv2--Dts&t=331.08s)]
