# Lara Trump: Even Kamala Harris dropped out before her home state voted
**Fox News:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k)
*  Here with more is the great podcast host maybe soon to be vice chair of the RNC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm hearing these rumors all over the place. I heard you will put in charge of South Carolina another rumor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=5.8s)]
*  Anyway, Laura Trump is back Laura. Great to have you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. And Sean I was actually in South Carolina all day on Wednesday [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=15.08s)]
*  Let me just tell you something the people of the state of South Carolina are ready to deliver a decisive victory tomorrow for Donald J [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=19.2s)]
*  Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=26.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think when we get into the expectation game that that always can be, you know [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=28.24s)]
*  a little a little slippery for a lot of people [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=34.28s)]
*  However looking at where we are having been to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And now South Carolina for a lot of presidential candidates, South Carolina's do or die [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=43.2s)]
*  Any double-digit loss tomorrow? What does that mean in your mind? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=49.2s)]
*  Well a loss is a loss and and the truth is you just kind of went through Nikki Haley's track record [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=53.31999999999999s)]
*  She has come in last place Sean in every single race in this primary [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  So you have Iowa she came in last New Hampshire last [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=63.8s)]
*  Wasn't even registered for the caucus in Nevada and lost the primary that didn't get her anything to none of these candidates [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=67.08s)]
*  That is bad. She is about to enter her home state of South Carolina [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=74.28s)]
*  Even Kamala Harris if you remember back four years ago [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=80.48s)]
*  Dropped out before her home state voted because even as much as Kamala Harris likes embarrassing herself as we see on a regular basis [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=84.84s)]
*  That was even a bridge too far for her [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=93.44s)]
*  So I think if Nikki Haley loses tomorrow as you just mentioned I said it the other day [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=95.52s)]
*  It is time to come on to team Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=100.96s)]
*  We all need to be focused Sean on one thing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=103.92s)]
*  November 5th of this year we need to be focused and ready to defeat Joe Biden and the Democrats [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=106.84s)]
*  And the reality is Nikki Haley what is it getting her to waste all of this donor money millions of dollars [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=113.84s)]
*  That could go to things like get out the vote efforts legal ballot harvesting voter registration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=120.84s)]
*  These are tactics and tools we are going to need to win on election day [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=125.84s)]
*  And I think it's very confusing to a lot of people why she is still in this position [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=129.84s)]
*  And I think it's very confusing to a lot of people why she is still in this race [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=135.84s)]
*  Laura Trump thank you as always we appreciate you being with us [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmIax_2x1k&t=140.84s)]
