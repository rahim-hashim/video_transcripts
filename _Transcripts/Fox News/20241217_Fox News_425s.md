# Huckabee: They're underestimating what's coming under Trump
**Fox News:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY)
*  former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, along with former governor of the state of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=0.0s)]
*  Arkansas, soon to be U.S. ambassador for Israel, the nominee for that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=4.12s)]
*  Mike Huckabee is with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=9.64s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=10.64s)]
*  Reince, let's start with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=11.64s)]
*  Well, I want to know your thoughts on the sabotage, but also, all of this talk of preemptive [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=12.64s)]
*  pardons. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump's been pretty clear. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Success will be our retribution. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=20.84s)]
*  However, there's a lot of talk of a lot of pardons given to a lot of people, frankly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=22.64s)]
*  not constitutionally tested, but my reading article, whatever, two of Section One of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=27.48s)]
*  Constitution is pretty clear. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=33.88s)]
*  The power of the pardon is absolute. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=35.88s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=37.6s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree with you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=38.6s)]
*  The pardon is absolute, and the president holds that power. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=42.4s)]
*  But also, you know, the president Biden, as to what Newt Gingrich has said, he's got to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=45.88s)]
*  live in reality. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  It's one thing for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=53.6s)]
*  You know, the entire premise of their campaign was totally rejected. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=55.4s)]
*  Their entire basis of their campaign was that Trump's a threat to democracy, Trump, Trump, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=59.64s)]
*  Trump, everything about Trump, and it was totally rejected. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=64.44s)]
*  So being out of touch is one thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=66.8s)]
*  Staying out of touch is another, and that's even worse. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=69.24s)]
*  So all of these pardons, all this nonsense that they're perpetrating on the American [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=72.36s)]
*  people, it's front and center, selling the border wall, continuing to snub the American [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=77.8s)]
*  people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=82.64s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=83.64s)]
*  Not going to Notre Dame in France, and instead going to Angola. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=85.16s)]
*  Nothing wrong with going to Angola, but this is the world stage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=90.32s)]
*  You're a Catholic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=93.4s)]
*  It's an important site for Catholics around the world, and you're not there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=94.4s)]
*  I mean, the fact of the matter is they're out to lunch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=98.2s)]
*  The American people are suffering, and it is something that no one could make up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=101.44s)]
*  You could not make this stuff up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=107.14s)]
*  And that's why, by the way, to what you were almost talking about there at the end with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=109.36s)]
*  Newt, this is the difference between 2024 and 2016. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=113.44s)]
*  Corporate America in 2016 wanted to make believe that what happened in 2016 wasn't real, that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=118.28s)]
*  we could ignore Donald Trump for the next four years, ignore everyone around Donald [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump and make believe that this was an aberration and would just go away. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=128.42s)]
*  In 2024, people see that we've got a realignment in America and a total rejection of the progressive [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=132.84s)]
*  left, which is why all of these companies and all of these things are happening all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=138.52s)]
*  around Donald Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=142.56s)]
*  He's driving the message in not just in the United States, but in the world today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=143.92s)]
*  Corporate America and all of the people that rejected this eight years ago, they're on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=150.28s)]
*  board and they understand that it is a new day in America. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=155.16s)]
*  Why, Governor Huckabee, with such a short time until the transition, why is Joe Biden [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=160.12s)]
*  escalating the conflict in Ukraine? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Why did he give the go ahead for Ukraine to fire ballistic missiles into Russia, causing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=169.84s)]
*  Russia to change their nuclear policy, which went from, OK, if you fire a ballistic missile [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=175.92s)]
*  into Russia, they have the right to nuke you, which then puts Europe at risk of World War [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  III. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=187.72s)]
*  Why, with everything that happened with Assad in Syria, Donald Trump said, stay away from [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=188.72s)]
*  it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=193.92s)]
*  America should not have a role at this time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know who will emerge as the leader. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  And Joe Biden is, you know, bombing, you know, dropping bombs all over Syria right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Why in these final hours? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  I think it's pretty evident that he's sort of like reliving 2020, the summer of love. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=209.56s)]
*  You had these people going in and looting stores and making a mess of cities because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=215.5s)]
*  they hated the man. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  And quite frankly, I think Joe Biden and his team, they can't stand Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=222.08s)]
*  And so they hope that the last words that are said of the Biden administration on January [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=226.52s)]
*  the 19th are clean up and aisle five. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=232.48s)]
*  Joe has really done it now, and he's messed up things across the world here at home. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=235.24s)]
*  He wants to make it as difficult for Donald Trump. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=240.9s)]
*  But you know what's going to happen? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=243.0s)]
*  I think he underestimates what Donald Trump is going to do when he gets into office. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=245.2s)]
*  It's going to be a remarkable new day to quote a famous candidate wife from Minnesota. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  We're going to turn the page and we're going to turn the page in a remarkable way. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=259.02s)]
*  And we're going to trade Barney Fife, who walks around with one bullet in his shirt [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  pocket for Wyatt Earp. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=267.02s)]
*  And that's going to be the beginning on January 20th. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=269.5s)]
*  And I can't wait. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=273.02s)]
*  It's just not going to get here quick enough. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=274.02s)]
*  Only Mike Huckabee can come up with these analogies. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=276.3s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=278.38s)]
*  The president was asked yesterday in his impromptu press conference, which in and of itself, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=280.06s)]
*  Governor Huckabee was refreshing, whether or not he would take out Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=285.42s)]
*  He said, I'm not going to answer that question. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=289.62s)]
*  But we already know the answer. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=292.1s)]
*  We know from day one he's going to implement sanctions and he's going to cut off the financial [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=294.02s)]
*  monies that Iran takes in that funds their terror network as the number one state sponsor [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=300.5s)]
*  of terror. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=306.7s)]
*  We know that's going to happen. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=307.7s)]
*  He's going to drive them into bankruptcy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=309.02s)]
*  And the second thing he's going to do, if at any point he feels or the intelligence [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=310.7s)]
*  community tells him they're close to a nuclear weapon, he's not going to let that happen. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=320.06s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=321.06s)]
*  I think you're probably right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=322.9s)]
*  But let's just remember that Donald Trump pretty much had bankrupted the Iranians in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  his first term. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  He didn't have to bomb them because he did bankrupt them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=329.78s)]
*  It was only because when Joe Biden came in, he opened up the spigots and let the Iranians [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  have money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  What did they do with that money? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=338.85999999999996s)]
*  They funded Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=340.05999999999995s)]
*  And 1200 Jewish civilians were massacred on October the 7th with money that was made possible [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  by relaxing the sanctions on the Iranians. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=349.61999999999995s)]
*  Let us never forget where that came from, who put the green light on that money and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=352.38s)]
*  what happened when it was given to the terrorist. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  Last question, Reince Priebus, you were there in 2017. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  Let's fast forward to January 20th, 2025. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=365.7s)]
*  What's day one going to look like? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  You were there the first time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  I think they're going to be so ready for this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=373.74s)]
*  I think you're going to look at 50 executive orders on energy deregulation, the border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=376.46s)]
*  I think this thing's going to come fast and heavy and all those 75 percent issues, secure [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=382.94s)]
*  the border, protect the American people, confront China's ripping off the world and end these [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=388.02s)]
*  wars and protect girls and sports. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=394.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what you're going to see on day one. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=396.5s)]
*  I think it's going to be an amazing day. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=398.06s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=400.26000000000005s)]
*  I think we're going to see a lot of movement on the border, on energy, and America's going [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=401.62s)]
*  to start feeling better about itself really quickly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  Hopefully we can get the economy running, get energy prices down quickly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0Zm4d4blY&t=409.18s)]
