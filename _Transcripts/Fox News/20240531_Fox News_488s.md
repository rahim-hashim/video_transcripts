# Sean Hannity: The Trump campaign is stronger than ever after the verdict
**Fox News:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk)
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, many Americans long suffering from Trump derangement syndrome are downright [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  giddy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=7.24s)]
*  But yesterday's verdict is not a cure for their disease. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=8.24s)]
*  In fact, the Trump campaign, I will argue tonight, is stronger than ever. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=11.64s)]
*  After the verdict, the former president's campaign said it raised what is a massive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  record $34.8 million in just six hours. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, that includes their site crashing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=24.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, one flash poll showing Donald Trump with a six point bump and the former president [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=27.56s)]
*  himself is now more determined than ever to save our country from political lawfare. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=32.6s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  This is a case where if they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  These are bad people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=48.2s)]
*  We weren't allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  You saw what happened to some of the witnesses that were on our side. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=57.08s)]
*  They were literally crucified. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=60.6s)]
*  I don't mind being out there because I'm doing something for this country and I'm doing something [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=62.68s)]
*  for our Constitution. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=67.0s)]
*  It's very important, far beyond me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=68.0s)]
*  And this can't be allowed to happen to other presidents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=71.56s)]
*  It should never be allowed to happen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=73.92s)]
*  And it all comes out of the White House. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=77.96s)]
*  He's the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  The most incompetent. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=84.56s)]
*  He's the dumbest president we've ever had. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=87.2s)]
*  He's the dumbest president, most incompetent president, and he's the most dishonest president [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=89.92s)]
*  we've ever had. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  And the only way they think they can win this election is by doing exactly what they're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=96.4s)]
*  doing right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Win it in the courts because they can't win it at the ballot box. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  So we're going to show them that we're going to fight because I'm willing to do whatever [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=106.2s)]
*  I have to do to save our country and to save our Constitution. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=112.8s)]
*  I don't mind. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=116.76s)]
*  Honored to do it for our country and our Constitution, and he's willing to do it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=121.44s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't need this, but he's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=126.56s)]
*  What happened yesterday was not justice. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=129.32s)]
*  I said from day one, he cannot get a fair trial in New York. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=131.88s)]
*  He didn't get a fair trial in New York. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=135.6s)]
*  And Mar-a-Lago is not worth $18 million. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=137.56s)]
*  This was a result of a reckless, dangerous, irresponsible show trial shedding the Constitution, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=141.0s)]
*  shedding the rule of law, all in an effort to weaponize our justice system. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=149.56s)]
*  This is what a dual justice system looks like. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=154.16s)]
*  But today we heard a much different message from your current president, Joey, who praised [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=156.76s)]
*  America's justice system. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=161.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=163.56s)]
*  The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=164.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=170.72s)]
*  It was a state case, not a federal case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=173.88s)]
*  And it was heard by a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=177.68s)]
*  It's reckless. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=184.44s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=186.2s)]
*  It's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=187.64s)]
*  Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=194.72s)]
*  And it literally is the cornerstone of America, our justice system. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=199.52s)]
*  The justice system should be respected. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=203.6s)]
*  What is reckless, dangerous, irresponsible is the weaponization of his Justice Department. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=207.44s)]
*  And to allow this to happen, all the details we've been giving you and all our legal experts [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=213.32s)]
*  have been giving you over the many weeks that this trial has gone on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=218.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was tried on a novel legal theory by an ADA, who, by the way, campaigned on [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=221.44s)]
*  his ability to get Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=230.4s)]
*  You've got to be kidding me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=231.4s)]
*  During a trial overseen by a partisan Biden donating judge convicted after just a few [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=232.6s)]
*  hours of deliberations by a jury of MSDNC fans selected from a district that voted up [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=239.36s)]
*  to, what, 90 percent for Joe Biden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=246.24s)]
*  This is a headline from the very liberal New York magazine, quote, prosecutors got [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=249.0s)]
*  Trump but they contorted the law. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=254.88s)]
*  That article written by fake news CNN, senior legal analyst, even a lion squirrel gets a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=258.12s)]
*  nut, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=264.84s)]
*  And he wrote, quote, the charges against Trump are obscure and nearly entirely unprecedented. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=265.84s)]
*  Then he said, no state prosecutor in New York or Wyoming or anywhere has ever charged federal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=272.44s)]
*  election laws as a direct or predicate state crime against anyone for anything, none, ever. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=279.24s)]
*  Democratic prosecutors in the state of New York, city of New York, including a former [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=288.04s)]
*  top official, the third top official of Biden's own DOJ, along with this radical Democratic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=292.32s)]
*  judge, twisted the law into a pretzel in order to convict the leading Republican presidential [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=299.88s)]
*  candidate in the middle of an election. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=305.48s)]
*  So you're not going to hear any complaints from Joe Biden or any other Democrat or their [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=308.32s)]
*  their allies in the media mob tell Americans no one is above the law. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=313.32s)]
*  Well, of course they're not going to. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=319.64s)]
*  There are a notable few exceptions, including what? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=322.0s)]
*  Biden himself? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=324.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=325.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=326.76s)]
*  The special counsel recently declined to charge President Biden with mishandling classified [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=327.8s)]
*  documents. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=332.4s)]
*  His four locations never got raided. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=333.56s)]
*  His home never got raided, despite ample evidence of criminal misconduct over multiple decades. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, they concluded, well, he's probably a nice old man is going to come off nice to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  a jury and he's just going to seem forgetful. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=345.88s)]
*  So we're not going to prosecute him. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=348.68s)]
*  Why didn't they raid his house? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=350.76s)]
*  Why didn't they raid Hillary Clinton's house? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=352.44s)]
*  The exact same allegations. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is currently awaiting a criminal trial for the mishandling of classified documents [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  over a few months. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=361.92s)]
*  Hillary Clinton also above the law like Joe in 2016. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  James Comey, the July 2016 press conference. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, what did she do? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  She mishandled top secret classified documents on her servers, illicit private servers she [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=373.72s)]
*  never should have had. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  Infamously, Comey saying no reasonable prosecutor would ever prosecute. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=381.12s)]
*  You know, Hillary Clinton during an election, according to Comey, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=385.48s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=389.16s)]
*  After Hillary Clinton and the DNC were caught mislabeling payments for that dirty disinformation, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=390.62s)]
*  Russian dossier is a legal expense. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Remember, it was funneled through a law firm that hired an op research firm that hired [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=399.44s)]
*  Christopher Steele. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=404.0s)]
*  That led to a dirty Russian disinformation dossier that resulted in not one but four separate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=405.56s)]
*  FISA warrants issued, three signed by James Comey himself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=411.72s)]
*  No criminal charges ever brought. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=416.16s)]
*  Both Clinton, the DNC, they were allowed to settle that matter quietly with a simple fine [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=418.32s)]
*  for the FEC that said in this case, had they been allowed to testify, no crime was committed. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=423.6s)]
*  No violation was committed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=429.12s)]
*  Keep in mind, Trump was convicted of 34 felonies for allegedly mislabeling a payment to a lawyer [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=431.16s)]
*  as a legal expense. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=438.04s)]
*  But we can right this ship. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=440.24s)]
*  You have the power. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=442.08s)]
*  The ultimate verdict lies with you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=443.08s)]
*  Donald Trump can finish what he started in 2016. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=445.32s)]
*  That's when Trump destroyed Hillary Clinton at the ballot box. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPPN9S1s5tk&t=448.92s)]
