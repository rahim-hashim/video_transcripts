# Sean Hannity: Biden is playing Russian roulette with the security of your family
**Fox News:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q)
*  As we have been warning you again and again and again, Joe Biden is playing Russian roulette [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  with the safety and the security of you and your family. For more than three long years, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=7.36s)]
*  this program and others on this channel, they have been sounding the alarm. The media mob, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=15.68s)]
*  state-run media, they have been complicit. They have been lying to you. The world's most dangerous [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=21.36s)]
*  terrorists, they're coming across Joe Biden's wide-open southern border, and terror cells are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=27.36s)]
*  now already right here inside of your country plotting and planning and scheming attacks against [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=33.2s)]
*  all of us. The FBI director, well, he's issued multiple dire warnings on Capitol Hill that have [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=39.44s)]
*  fallen on deaf ears at the White House. He should have gone a lot further and forced Joe Biden to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=46.0s)]
*  enforce the law. We'll get to that. And now the threat that is posed by terror has not been this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=50.72s)]
*  high since 9-11-01, and you are not safe. Joe Biden has created what is a clear and present [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=56.56s)]
*  national security danger for our country, and neither his attorney general nor his FBI director [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  have demanded, as they should, that he start enforcing our nation's laws and not aid in a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  bet and the law breaking. They too bear responsibility for what is coming. It is no longer if an attack is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=76.16s)]
*  coming. It is when an attack is coming. Now, said this before, I'll say it again. I pray to God in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=83.84s)]
*  heaven that I am wrong, but I have eyes to see I'm not wrong. Last year, the New York Times actually [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=90.0s)]
*  fact-checked this warning and pretended that it was false. They said terrorists are not coming across [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=97.2s)]
*  our border. Have they vetted every 11 million people? No, they haven't, and that we have nothing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=102.88s)]
*  to worry about. But as per usual, the New York Times, they were wrong. They were lying to you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=108.8s)]
*  Watch. They'll probably get another phony Pulitzer Prize over their lying. Now, take a look at your [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=114.72s)]
*  screen. Eight Joe Biden unvetted illegal immigrants from Tajikistan with suspected ties to ISIS. They [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=119.28s)]
*  were just apprehended in a multi-city operation. At least two of the accused terrorists have been [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=126.96s)]
*  operating inside of our country for more than a year. According to FoxNews.com, all of these [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=132.48s)]
*  suspected terrorists were, quote, fully vetted at the border before Biden released them into the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=138.48s)]
*  country. Fully vetted? Really? Another lie like what? The three-year lie that the border is secure [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=145.2s)]
*  and the border is closed that we heard over and over again? And by the way, breaking moments ago, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=152.48s)]
*  from our very own Bill Mollusian, a bombshell new report from the Department of Homeland Securities, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=157.76s)]
*  Inspector General, it found that illegal immigrants have not been effectively screened [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=163.28s)]
*  at the southern border. Let me quote from the Inspector General directly, shall I? Quote, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=168.96s)]
*  DHS will remain at risk of admitting dangerous persons into the country or enabling asylum [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=174.48s)]
*  seekers who may pose significant threats to public safety and national security to continue [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=181.6s)]
*  to reside in the United States. Well, we're talking about well over 10 million unvetted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=187.68s)]
*  Joe Biden illegal immigrants pouring into the country in just a little over three years, along [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  with another million or so, it's anybody's guess, gotaways that were never apprehended. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=198.72s)]
*  Obviously, there's no serious vetting. There never has been any serious vetting going on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  And keep in mind, most special interests, high-risk illegal immigrants come from countries that do not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=209.52s)]
*  cooperate with the United States. You know, our top geopolitical foes that hate us, you know, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=215.44s)]
*  think about this, the countries that hate us, they're not helping us vet their terrorists, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=221.2s)]
*  their criminals, their spies. Many of these illegal immigrants, they don't even have documents when [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=227.12s)]
*  they cross, making it impossible to even know who they really are. And Joe Biden is letting all of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=232.96s)]
*  them into the country, forcing you to pay for their food and their housing and their transportation, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=240.48s)]
*  their healthcare, their medicine. And of course, if they have children, free education to their kids. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=246.48s)]
*  According to a report, more than 30,000 Chinese nationals, 30,000, our number one geopolitical foe [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=252.72s)]
*  have crossed the border just since October, this fiscal year. That's on top of the 26,000 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=259.2s)]
*  that came the year before. The most recent official numbers show that in just two years, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=266.24s)]
*  more than 12,000 Russians poured across the border, along with nearly, what, a thousand illegal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=271.68s)]
*  immigrants from Iran and more than 500 from Syria, over 3,000 from Egypt, over 6,000 from Afghanistan. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=277.04s)]
*  Then we have people from Yemen and Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  Thanks to your president, there has been unfettered illegal immigration from every single [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=291.28s)]
*  terrorist hotspot on the globe. And in case anybody forgot, terror groups like ISIS, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  they want as many dead Americans as possible. Remember what their motto is, Joe, did you forget? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Convert or die. ISIS has already carried out dozens of large scale terror attacks all over [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=310.08s)]
*  the world for the last decade. And since Biden has now opened up our borders, well, some of these [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=316.88s)]
*  suspected terrorists have been living in a neighborhood right near you. What are they doing? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=322.32s)]
*  They're plotting, organizing, waiting to strike. Dozens and dozens of illegal immigrants are even [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=327.04s)]
*  using Logan Airport in Boston as a makeshift shelter with more than a hundred sleeping on the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=332.88s)]
*  floor. Do we even know who they really are? No, we don't, but nobody on the left seems to care. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=339.52s)]
*  They've just lied to us. No, the border is secure. Don't believe your own eyes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=346.16s)]
*  The border is closed. Joe Biden's executive order, you know, this election year conversion was a joke. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  It did absolutely nothing. There has been no impact at the border. The border czar, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  Kamala Harris, another joke, refuses to lift a finger to address the crisis. She refuses to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  even go to a single border hotspot. She doesn't want to go down to the border and do her job. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Democrats on Capitol Hill, they just want to speed up the process for illegal immigrants [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=373.6s)]
*  with more judges, more bureaucrats. And by the way, the mob and the media, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=378.8s)]
*  it is more than happy to put their heads in the sand and lie as per usual. The only thing they [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  care about is hoping that Donald Trump doesn't win and Joe Biden does. And by the way, remember, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=388.88s)]
*  the New York Times fact check that we mentioned at the top? Yeah, the Times falsely reported that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=394.16s)]
*  terrorists were not crossing, coming across the border. According to Bill Mollusian, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  as of this morning, the New York Times, they didn't make a single mention of the suspected [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=404.64s)]
*  ISIS terrorists who were apprehended, even though some of the arrests took place in New York, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=410.96s)]
*  where the New York Times resides. So what's it going to take for the left in this country [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=417.28s)]
*  to wake up? Sadly, it is clear that the worst is yet to come. Again, I will say it over and over. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. But thanks to the Biden administration, it appears that a future terrorist [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=429.68s)]
*  attack inside of your country is all but certain. Blood will be on his hands and all the other [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=436.0s)]
*  liars along with him. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mR1SVWX_Q&t=443.59999999999997s)]
