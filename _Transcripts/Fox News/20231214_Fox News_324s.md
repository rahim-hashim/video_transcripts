# Hannity: I've never been more concerned as I am right now
**Fox News:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY)
*  Again, earlier tonight, the House voted to formally authorize the Joe Biden impeachment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=0.0s)]
*  inquiry. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=4.8s)]
*  Today, the vote came as a new poll showed an increase in support for the GOP's latest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=5.8s)]
*  move. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=10.88s)]
*  Here with reaction Florida Governor, 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=11.88s)]
*  Governor, great to have you back. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=16.4s)]
*  I'm still getting a lot of reaction to the debate between you and Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=18.92s)]
*  When you look at the legal troubles and the cognitive issues of Joe Biden, I know Gavin [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  said that he'd choose Joe Biden at 100 over any Republican. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=29.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  What do you see happening? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=37.2s)]
*  Do you think he survives this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=38.2s)]
*  Well, Sean, I don't think we've spoken since that debate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=40.64s)]
*  The reaction that I've gotten has been incredible in terms of obviously being able to show that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=47.0s)]
*  freedom works and the California model's a failure, what that means for the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=52.06s)]
*  The way you set it up and they said it was the most substantive debate that they've seen [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=58.6s)]
*  in this entire election cycle. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=63.56s)]
*  So kudos to you for doing it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=66.04s)]
*  I know he had challenged me and you asked me to do it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=68.08s)]
*  So I'm glad we were able to get that done. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=71.48s)]
*  Just know if you want to do other debates, Nikki Haley and me, I'm in. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=73.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and me, I'm in. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=78.48s)]
*  So just say the word. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=80.56s)]
*  You've shown that you can do it in a way that I think really helps the voters. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=82.56s)]
*  So I'm game. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=86.08s)]
*  Just let me know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=87.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=88.56s)]
*  Those are two. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=89.56s)]
*  Do you have any more on your list? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=90.56s)]
*  Maybe Joe Manchin, he's going on a two-month tour. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=91.56s)]
*  Anybody else on your list that you'd like to debate? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=94.32s)]
*  No, I don't think he's going anywhere. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=95.92s)]
*  But I think on the Biden thing, so listen, and this is part of the reason why I thought [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=97.52s)]
*  it was important that we do this Newsom debate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=101.52s)]
*  Obviously there's a lot of Democrats that want to remove him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=104.84s)]
*  They understand the liabilities. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=108.56s)]
*  They understand his bad policies. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=110.34s)]
*  I think he is not willing to step down at this point, but who knows what's going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  happen? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=117.6s)]
*  And I think this inquiry is justified. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=118.6s)]
*  I think it should have been done long ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  He's got so many issues that are clouding his presidency. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=122.88s)]
*  He clearly would not be a great candidate for the Democrats. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  So Republicans, we need to be ready for whoever they pull out of the hat. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=130.16s)]
*  Newsom has been waiting in the wings. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=135.68s)]
*  I mean, quite frankly, after that debate, I'm not sure that that's the candidate that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  they would want because he embraced Biden, said Biden did an A-plus job as president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=141.2s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  But then he also is saddled with all of his baggage in California. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=147.52s)]
*  You have homelessness through the roof, crime pushing people out of communities and even [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  all the poop on the street in San Francisco. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=157.2s)]
*  So I don't think that they want to have to litigate on two fronts to have to defend [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=160.04s)]
*  Biden's failed policies and defend the failed California policies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=164.12s)]
*  But I do think we have to be ready that it could be someone else. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=168.72s)]
*  Governor, I don't think in all the years I've been doing this on radio and TV, I don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=171.8s)]
*  think I've ever been as concerned as I am right now about the state of our economy and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  the state of the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And it is that I think we are living in consequential times and this election is going to mean [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=183.08s)]
*  everything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the issues, if we don't get this, if we don't right this ship, I don't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=190.84s)]
*  even want to think about what the consequences would be. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=197.56s)]
*  And I'm sure that's what you think about as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=199.72s)]
*  Well, think about it. We have a government that's actively working against hardworking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=203.76s)]
*  Americans. They're working hard. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=208.32s)]
*  They can't get ahead because of inflation, interest rates, by dynamics, the bureaucracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=210.16s)]
*  We have an open border where eight million people have come since Biden's been president [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=215.44s)]
*  from all over the world, including the Middle East. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=220.44s)]
*  We know that there are potential terrorists that have come in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=223.4s)]
*  That's made the American people less safe, less secure. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=226.04s)]
*  We have fentanyl pouring into our communities. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  We have cities that are collapsing, San Francisco, Los Angeles, but also Philly, Chicago, all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=231.72s)]
*  these places where obviously cities have always had issue, but they're becoming unlivable. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=238.2s)]
*  So you have all these issues that are compounding. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=243.64s)]
*  And then, of course, you have China on the march. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=246.56s)]
*  You have war in Israel versus Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=250.0s)]
*  And Biden is trying to kneecap our great ally, Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=253.04s)]
*  So it really is a perfect storm. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=256.68s)]
*  And I don't think I've seen anything like this in my lifetime. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=258.4s)]
*  And I think you'd probably have to go back to the late 1970s under Jimmy Carter when our [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=262.2s)]
*  nation was really suffering under the accumulation of a lot of problems. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=267.36s)]
*  A lot of people thought America's best days were behind it then. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=271.24s)]
*  Ronald Reagan thought differently. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=274.44s)]
*  I think we can reverse this decline, Sean, but 2024 is make or break. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=275.96s)]
*  That's why I thought the red state, blue state debate was so important. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=281.04s)]
*  And I'll be honest, Governor, I'm getting out of New York. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=284.4s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=287.28s)]
*  And Florida's right there at the top of my list. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=289.36s)]
*  Just let me know. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=291.44s)]
*  I have some connections at the DMV in Florida. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=292.44s)]
*  I have connections at the DMV. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=296.32s)]
*  I'll get your driver's license. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=297.8s)]
*  Just let me know. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=298.92s)]
*  All right, I don't have to wait online for four hours or 50 hours like New York. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=300.08s)]
*  I'd appreciate it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=304.36s)]
*  Anyway, Governor, great to see you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=305.96s)]
*  We'll get it done. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=307.16s)]
*  That was a good debate. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=307.76s)]
*  And I will put out your challenge, I promise. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWsUdfo6CY&t=308.64s)]
