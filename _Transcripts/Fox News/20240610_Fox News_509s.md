# Sean Hannity: The Bidens are the most morally corrupt people in America
**Fox News:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I)
*  turn our attention to some of the most shameless and morally corrupt people in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=0.0s)]
*  That would be the Bidens. Many in the mob, the media, they love to point out that Hunter Biden's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=5.12s)]
*  ongoing trial is an example that even a Biden can face justice. But in reality, Hunter's trial is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=10.08s)]
*  but a perfect example of the lengths your government will go to, allegedly to protect the son of a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=17.04s)]
*  prominent Democrat. Now, according to the very real contents of Hunter's very real laptop, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=23.52s)]
*  the president's son engaged in a life of crime for many years. The evidence seems transparent [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=30.32s)]
*  and overwhelming, but you decide. It was on a massive scale. Remember the fallout of the 2020? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=35.76s)]
*  51 Intel experts signing off on a letter claiming the laptop had all the hallmarks of Russian [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=41.44s)]
*  disinformation. This after three years of lies being peddled over and over again, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=48.4s)]
*  the Russia hoax by the media mob, all of it a lie, all of it based on a dirty dossier. The dossier [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=53.68s)]
*  becomes the basis of lying to FISA courts four separate times. Three of them signed by Mr. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=60.16s)]
*  Higher Honor himself, James Comey. In reality, the so-called experts were spreading disinformation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=66.4s)]
*  All they knew about the laptop was nothing. They only knew they wanted Joe Biden to win. You think [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=72.72s)]
*  they'd apologize? Don't hold your breath. Now that the laptop is official evidence at Hunter's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=77.6s)]
*  gun trial, well, Fox News Digital reached out to the all 51 Intel experts that signed on to the letter [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  and most had no regrets at all whatsoever. They got what they wanted. They helped Joe Biden get [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=90.0s)]
*  the election in 2020, some even claiming that it was the patriotic thing to do, a means to an end. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=96.0s)]
*  Anyway, of course, Joe Biden is now president. The evidence of the alleged wrongdoing on that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=103.04s)]
*  laptop is shocking. You have rampant drug use, hundreds of thousands of dollars seemingly, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  I can't say for sure, spent soliciting sex, purported tax evasion on millions of dollars [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  in income that needs to be investigated, refusing to even file tax returns in certain years, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=121.28s)]
*  along with the possibility should be investigated of money laundering, the possibility of fair [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=127.76s)]
*  violations tied to his own father. Many Americans can rightly sympathize, sure, with Hunter's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=134.0s)]
*  addictions and personal struggles, but not the millions and millions and millions made with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=139.6s)]
*  businesses in which he admits he had zero experience at all or the shady actions of his [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=145.36s)]
*  father's Department of Justice, which is politicized and weaponized. According to the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=151.84s)]
*  New York Times, the DOJ prosecutor that's tasked with investigating Hunter, this guy, David Weiss, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=157.28s)]
*  remember, he's going to sweep the whole thing. Plan A, under the rug, no charges at all. After [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  purposely letting the statute of limitations run out on some of the most serious tax charges from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=169.76s)]
*  the Burisma years, Plan A, well, got ruined by two brave IRS whistleblowers. On to Plan B, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=175.44s)]
*  that was the sweetheart plea deal that looped a temporary gun charge in with a few minor tax [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=182.56s)]
*  violations, no jail time. Yeah, sadly, Plan B was ruined because the judge actually read the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=188.08s)]
*  plea deal and started asking real questions about the totally completely unprecedented nature of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  the deal. And now we're on to Plan C. Well, after years of investigating, let's make this guy the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=201.84s)]
*  special prosecutor. Let's go into a friendly venue in Delaware in a courthouse there and hope [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=207.44s)]
*  for the best. The jury has officially begun their deliberations. You know, any outcome won't surprise [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=212.56s)]
*  me, including outright acquittal or a hung jury, but they'll decide if Hunter is guilty on the three [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=218.4s)]
*  felony charges. Count one accuses Hunter of lying on an ATF form when purchasing a gun, swearing that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=224.16s)]
*  he was not addicted to drugs. Count two accuses Hunter of lying to the gun dealer. Count three [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=231.04s)]
*  alleges that Hunter illegally possessed the gun while addicted to drugs or actively using drugs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=236.8s)]
*  The evidence seems to me overwhelming based on evidence from the trial. One day after buying the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  gun, Hunter texted his girlfriend. He was waiting for his dealer. The next day, Hunter texted his [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=248.96s)]
*  girlfriend. He's smoking crack. So let's be clear. These allegations are not a joke. Joe Biden, his [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=254.56s)]
*  fellow Democrats, don't they love to lecture you about gun control? In fact, President Biden is now [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=260.64s)]
*  proposing tighter regulations surrounding lawful gun ownership and steep penalties for anyone who [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=267.2s)]
*  dares to step out of line. And yet his own son is on trial for gun crimes. But if this is the only [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=274.0s)]
*  trial the Hunter faces, this will only prove that Biden's DOJ, as we have been telling you, is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  politicized and weaponized. The judge instructed the jury to ignore Hunter's ties to the first [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=287.52s)]
*  family. But let's be clear. It's because of those ties that Hunter now is only facing gun charges [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=293.36s)]
*  in the Biden-friendly venue of Delaware. He's not getting the Donald Trump treatment like Trump got [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=300.64s)]
*  in New York with a valuation of Mar-a-Lago at a mere $18 million in a case that involved, well, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  valuations. The judge in that civil trial was more guilty of valuation fraud than anything they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=314.0s)]
*  accused Donald Trump of. And then, of course, we have the case of Alvin Bragg. Misdemeanor, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=320.4s)]
*  statute of limitations, expired, upcharge it to a felony, election crime, but don't even tell Trump [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=326.0s)]
*  what you're charging him with. You know, more importantly about the Bidens, why did foreign, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=332.08s)]
*  oh, oligarchs, why did they pay Hunter Biden millions and millions of dollars, according to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=337.92s)]
*  the Johnson-Grassley Senate report? What services was he capable of providing if he was admittedly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=343.44s)]
*  addicted to drugs at the time? Now, if he was lobbying on behalf of a foreign entity, why didn't [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=350.08s)]
*  he register with Farah? Isn't that required by law? And why did Hunter and the entire Biden family [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=356.56s)]
*  use over 20 shell corporations, according to the House Oversight Committee? Were those accounts [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=363.44s)]
*  actually used to funnel foreign funds to different members of the family? Hmm, interesting questions, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=369.12s)]
*  right? Did the big guy financially benefit from Hunter's foreign deals in any way? According to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=375.04s)]
*  the laptop that apparently is very real, well, the big guy had 10% put aside for him, and Hunter [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=381.04s)]
*  complained bitterly about giving half his income to Pops and complained about paying for Pops' home [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=387.44s)]
*  repairs. Why did the big guy lie to you, every one of you watching this show, about meeting with his [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=393.28s)]
*  son's business associates? Remember, Joe said over and over, he never one time ever spoke to his son, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=400.64s)]
*  brother, or anybody about these foreign business deals. Devin Archer said that he recalls Joe Biden [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=406.96s)]
*  calling into at least 20 meetings with Hunter and these foreign business partners. And what about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=412.55999999999995s)]
*  Burisma, the Ukrainian energy giant? Hunter admits no experience in oil, gas, coal, Ukraine when he [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=418.8s)]
*  goes on Good Morning America, but then gets paid millions to sit on that company's board. And then, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=425.68s)]
*  Joe, you might recall, bragged about leveraging a billion of your dollars to get the Ukrainian [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=431.44000000000005s)]
*  prosecutor investigating this company and his son fired, brags about getting it all done within six [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=438.24s)]
*  hours. The result of that firing, Hunter continues to get paid for zero experience. Never mind the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=444.72s)]
*  Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC, we'll save that for another day. As you can see, Hunter's gun trial [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=451.92s)]
*  is really just the tip of the iceberg. Frankly, I would call it low-hanging fruit when it comes to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  Hunter. And just below the surface, it's not a pretty picture, make no mistake, when a family [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  can ostracize their own five-year-old granddaughter and ignore her existence until shamed by Maureen [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=468.4s)]
*  Dowd at the New York Times and then never even follow up to talk to her, meet with her, include [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  her. It's pretty safe to assume the worst. But of course, everyone, including Hunter, they were [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, right? So tonight, we continue to await the verdict [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=488.32s)]
*  at a Delaware, not exactly an unfriendly venue for a Biden. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ppRb5PQ-I&t=493.28s)]
