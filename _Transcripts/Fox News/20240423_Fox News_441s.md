# Hannity: Biden has a lot of explaining to do
**Fox News:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4)
*  Now, of course, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, he's busy with way more important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=0.0s)]
*  matters, like an 8-year-old misdemeanor well past the statute of limitations surrounding [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=5.16s)]
*  the alleged mislabeling of a nondisclosure agreement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=10.64s)]
*  Now, there are people pledging allegiance to Hamas on the streets of New York City and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  other places around the country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=20.48s)]
*  But according to Alvin Bragg, well, possibly mislabeling a business expense from, oh, eight [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=22.44s)]
*  years ago is way more important, a far more pressing issue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=27.84s)]
*  So, Donald Trump, he continues to languish in a Manhattan courtroom where anti-Trump [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=31.8s)]
*  prosecutors and an anti-Trump judge pretend to be solemn arbiters of justice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=37.56s)]
*  When they are not, at the very same time, New York's well-to-do social justice warriors [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=43.72s)]
*  turned Hamas sympathizers, they are wreaking havoc all across the city of New York, not [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=49.6s)]
*  even the embattled actor Alec Baldwin is safe from their harassment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=55.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=59.76s)]
*  F*** Israel, f*** Zionism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=60.76s)]
*  Please say it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=63.76s)]
*  One time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=66.44s)]
*  Could you give me one quick minute? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=67.44s)]
*  All right, it's rare. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=71.96s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=72.96s)]
*  I am defending Alec Baldwin later in the program, but attempting to coerce a political statement [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=74.0s)]
*  from someone just trying to buy coffee is beyond gross, inappropriate, and we should [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=79.92s)]
*  be better than that as a country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=85.56s)]
*  We'll have more coming up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=87.04s)]
*  Now, of course, what Alec Baldwin just encountered pales in comparison to what many Jewish students [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=88.04s)]
*  have faced now across New York City and the country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=94.4s)]
*  For example, at the Ivy League institution, Columbia, they have been run out of town literally [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=97.48s)]
*  for weeks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=102.66s)]
*  Hundreds of anti-Israel agitators occupying a central location on Columbia's campus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=103.66s)]
*  They're pitching their tents. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=109.94000000000001s)]
*  They're blocking a key passageway. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  They are disrupting nearby classes and harassing anyone who seemed even remotely pro-Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=113.22s)]
*  There were signs praising Hamas, praising terrorism, also calls for a global antifada, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=120.14s)]
*  which is a religious war against the Jewish people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=125.98s)]
*  Nearby, masked individuals chanting for more attacks like the terror attack on October [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=129.74s)]
*  7 and calling on terrorists to murder and to rape pro-Israel protesters. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=135.54s)]
*  Now, the school's rabbi urged all Jewish students to leave the area immediately, return [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=141.14s)]
*  home because that campus is simply not safe for them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  Now, a Jewish professor was reportedly banned from the campus to prevent a violent uproar [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=150.78s)]
*  from this crowd of angry, quote, peaceful protesters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  Republican lawmakers, they are now calling on Biden to mobilize the National Guard to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=160.18s)]
*  protect the local Jewish population. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=164.84s)]
*  But now, instead of clearing the campus and restoring order, Columbia's president is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=167.52s)]
*  ordering the classes be made available online. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=172.88s)]
*  That would mean that the school's Jewish population can now complete the semester, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=176.0s)]
*  hiding away in the safety of their own homes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=180.72s)]
*  Does that not seem wrong to you? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=183.04s)]
*  Columbia's president is a gutless coward who now faces numerous calls, rightly so to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=185.04s)]
*  resign. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=190.16s)]
*  But we see the same response from almost every elite school president, now facing a violent [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=191.36s)]
*  disruptive protest, terrified by their own radical professors, many tenured, and students. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  And these schools do nothing in the face of what is raw, repulsive bigotry, hatred, anti-Semitism, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  leaving their minority Jewish population simply to wither on the vine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=210.44000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=215.36s)]
*  This is an NYU protest where demonstrator alludes to the horrific attack on October [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=217.4s)]
*  7th with a sign that reads, take a look right there, resist colonial power by any means [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=223.32s)]
*  necessary. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=229.32s)]
*  Now, does that include the rape and the murder of the Jewish people? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=230.32s)]
*  Does that include burning entire families alive? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=234.44s)]
*  What about abducting kids and babies? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=237.44s)]
*  What about the beheading of some of those young children and women and men as well? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=240.06s)]
*  What about a violent revolution against the American Republic? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=245.5s)]
*  What do you think they mean when they chant, death to Israel, death to America? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=250.06s)]
*  What does that mean to them? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=254.78s)]
*  And by the way, where's your president? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=256.54s)]
*  Where's Joe, the one who promised to restore the soul of a nation, the one that cares so [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=259.34s)]
*  much about democracy that he claims is in peril? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=264.78s)]
*  Well, today he was far away from any of these protests, struggling to walk, struggling to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=268.34s)]
*  talk, made up stories about his experience as a big rig driver, as per usual, avoiding [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=273.78s)]
*  reporters like the plague. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=280.7s)]
*  Biden has been nothing himself but gutless. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  He has been cowardly because he desperately needs support from his violent, in some cases, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=284.94s)]
*  anti-Semitic base. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=291.7s)]
*  And Joe doesn't really want to weigh in and pick a side. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=293.38s)]
*  His own State Department condemned Israel yesterday in a report that likened the world's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=296.78s)]
*  only Jewish state to the terrorist group Hamas, citing both for human rights violations. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=301.86s)]
*  Did they forget who the victims of terrorism were here? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=308.14s)]
*  How is it possible that the leader of the free world has zero in terms of a moral compass? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=311.78s)]
*  How is it he has been appeasing the number one state sponsor of terror, Iran, his entire [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  term as president and his eight years as vice president, the number one state sponsor of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=324.38s)]
*  terror? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=330.02s)]
*  Why won't the president of your country stand firmly against radical Islamic terrorists [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=331.02s)]
*  that have, as part of their charter, the destruction of Israel? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=337.26s)]
*  I guess he'll probably get busy restoring the soul of a nation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I don't know, maybe when his borders are actually goes down to the troubled parts of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  the border. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump was busy attending another mandated session of the Democratic [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  Party's latest dog and pony show. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=357.26s)]
*  And of course, the weaponization of justice on full display for all to see. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=360.1s)]
*  He did take time to weigh in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=364.18s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=365.82s)]
*  What's going on at the college level and we colleges, Columbia, NYU and others is the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=366.82s)]
*  disgrace. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=374.02s)]
*  And it's a it's really on Biden. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=375.02s)]
*  He has the wrong signal. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=377.02s)]
*  He's got the wrong tone. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=378.02s)]
*  He's got the wrong words. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=379.02s)]
*  He doesn't know who he's backing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=380.02s)]
*  And it's a mess. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=383.02s)]
*  Joe Biden has a lot of explaining to do, but don't expect a Gettysburg addressed aside [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  from aside from his obvious mental deficiencies and cognitive decline. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=391.94s)]
*  He is not a leader at best. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=396.9s)]
*  I'm being charitable. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=400.34s)]
*  He's a mediocre lifelong politician looking out for his own blind political ambition, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=401.97999999999996s)]
*  out for number one, all while making up a lot of folksy stories and heroic tall tales [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=408.74s)]
*  in order to bolster his deteriorating self image. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=414.9s)]
*  But in the 195 days, you, the American people, you will have a chance to get our country [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=419.82s)]
*  back on track. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWRrOeB-7o4&t=438.38s)]
