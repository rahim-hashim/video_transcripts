# Iran is a ‘real threat’: Rep. Jim Jordan
**Fox News:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k)
*  Joining us with more, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Concha. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=4.64s)]
*  Let's talk about the rhetoric, Jim Jordan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=5.64s)]
*  If I said the things that you just heard, what would the narrative on me be if I said [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  it about Democrats, which, by the way, I wouldn't say? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=13.44s)]
*  No, of course you wouldn't say that, but the Democrats would go crazy and there would [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=16.44s)]
*  be all kinds of things said about you then after those statements. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=19.96s)]
*  But they talked about threats. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=23.0s)]
*  How about the real threats? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The real threat of Iran, who said they want to assassinate President Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=26.1s)]
*  Iran, who's behind the attacks on our best friend, the state of Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Iran, who hacked President Trump's campaign, got a 271-page dossier on Vice Presidential [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=33.36s)]
*  candidate JD Bant that they put together when they were vetting who was going to be the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  VP and leaked it to the Harris campaign. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=42.96s)]
*  And then it winds up in the press. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=46.92s)]
*  How about that real threat? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=48.8s)]
*  And we were trying to get answers from the FBI. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=50.56s)]
*  We haven't got any yet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  When did they get it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=54.16s)]
*  When did they know about this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=55.16s)]
*  Did they give President Trump a defensive briefing? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=56.16s)]
*  This is Iran for goodness sake. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=58.64s)]
*  That's a real threat versus all this talk from the left about President Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=60.8s)]
*  When President Trump was in office, Iran wasn't behind attacks on Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=65.4s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=69.16s)]
*  Russia wasn't in Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=70.16s)]
*  That is a real threat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=71.6s)]
*  And they're going after President. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=72.84s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=73.84s)]
*  I want to know how that got hacked because if it had been reversed, Sean, if it would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=75.16s)]
*  have been, oh, Iran hacks the Harris campaign and gave a 271-page dossier on Tim Walz to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=79.48s)]
*  the Trump campaign and it wound up in the press. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=85.8s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=88.4s)]
*  There would only be a special counsel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=89.4s)]
*  So that's the real threat. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=91.2s)]
*  And they can say all they want. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=92.36s)]
*  But I think the American people see through it all. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Joe, you study the media constantly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=96.44s)]
*  You hear the rhetoric even now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=100.48s)]
*  And then you watch this pathetic interview. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=103.12s)]
*  I'll scroll all the questions that weren't brought up tonight to remind our audience. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=105.0s)]
*  I go through the list often. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=109.72s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're exactly right about that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  The rhetoric. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=115.56s)]
*  I remember after Donald Trump was elected, there was literally in Central Park a rendition [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=116.56s)]
*  of Caesar, except they replaced Caesar with Donald Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=122.92s)]
*  And then he is shown stabbed to death at the end of that particular play. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=125.52s)]
*  We all remember Kathy Griffin holding up a severed head of the likeness of Donald Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=129.72s)]
*  I can go on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, this has been going on now for many years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And enough people are going to be triggered by that where they might actually try to take [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=136.72s)]
*  the president's life out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=139.56s)]
*  Now, as far as this debate, we saw exactly I'm sorry, this interview tonight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=140.56s)]
*  We saw exactly why Stephanie Ruhl was chosen to conduct this interview, if you can even [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=145.38s)]
*  call it that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=148.78s)]
*  Not one fact check, neither during or after this interview, just like we saw at the ABC [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=149.78s)]
*  debate, not one interruption once again. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=155.22s)]
*  And Kamala Harris sounded again like a sophomore trying to get through a minimum time limit, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=158.14s)]
*  giving an oral book report. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=162.94s)]
*  There was not one question, Sean, on Joe Biden's mental decline and Kamala Harris's role in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=164.4s)]
*  the biggest cover up in political history. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  Not one question on taxing unrealized capital gains, which every economist says will tank [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=171.36s)]
*  the stock market. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=176.36s)]
*  Not one question on Kamala, literally on tape, chanting over and over, down, down with deportation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=177.44000000000003s)]
*  unquote, right before her first run for president. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=183.46s)]
*  Easy questions asked, Sean. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=186.36s)]
*  Do you still support shutting down all deportations, Madam Vice President? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=187.68s)]
*  You once compared ICE agents to the KKK. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=191.08s)]
*  Why should anyone believe that you're tough on the border now? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=193.46s)]
*  Hey, Ms. Harris, do sanctuary cities really work? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Hey, by the way, you signed a petition that the U.S. government should pay for sex changes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=199.04s)]
*  for illegals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=202.68s)]
*  Is that still the case? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=203.68s)]
*  Ms. Harris, can men get pregnant? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=204.68s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, once again, the most scripted, rehearsed candidate you will ever see. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  During her first answer, within the first sentence, she was already talking about hopes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=212.0s)]
*  and dreams and aspirations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=216.24s)]
*  Within the first 90 seconds, she once again reminded us that she grew up in a middle-class [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=217.82s)]
*  household. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=222.0s)]
*  In the same answer, she went right back to hopes and dreams and aspirations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=223.0s)]
*  In one answer on tax rates, she said no less than four times in the same answer that people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=227.5s)]
*  need to pay their fair share. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=233.82s)]
*  And when asked why the Teamsters wouldn't endorse her, she didn't answer the question [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=235.5s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=238.54s)]
*  The CPU that is her brain malfunctioned once again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=239.54s)]
*  And as we're seeing now with recent polls like Gallup showing they're forecasting a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=242.26s)]
*  three-point popular vote victory for Trump, and they're very accurate, Gallup is in these [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=245.78s)]
*  situations, she's going to have to go with a different approach, because this is not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=250.02s)]
*  going well, and it's definitely not going to play well in the states that matter, like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=253.02s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=256.74s)]
*  Jim Jordan, I want to get an update on the weaponization of our Justice Department. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=259.66s)]
*  We expect tomorrow on the January 6th case, which, by the way, we now have five people, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=264.62s)]
*  including General Milley, Acting Defense Secretary Miller, Cash Patel, Mark Meadows and Donald [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=270.06s)]
*  Trump, all confirming that he authorized National Guard troops prior to January 6th, on January [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  3rd. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=284.66s)]
*  But they're going to lay out this case while early voting is going on, 40 days before [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=285.74s)]
*  an election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=291.38s)]
*  My understanding is that violates a provision in the DOJ manual. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=292.38s)]
*  It is obviously political. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=295.98s)]
*  It is designed to put these allegations in front of the American people before the election [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=297.98s)]
*  with no meaningful chance of rebuttal. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=303.38s)]
*  And all the media will do is quote it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=309.42s)]
*  Now, is that the DOJ putting cinder blocks on the scale of an election? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=310.42s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=313.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=314.74s)]
*  And we had a hearing today where we had the Inspector General for the Justice Department [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=315.74s)]
*  in, and he basically said that under questioning from one of our members that he believes that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=319.3s)]
*  there were confidential human sources here on January 6th. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=325.38s)]
*  We want that report released. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=329.52s)]
*  Now, he didn't absolutely confirm that, but it sure sounded like that was the case. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  And that report is not going to come out, based on his testimony today, not going to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=335.1s)]
*  come out until after the election. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=338.82s)]
*  That's information we'd like to know now, 41 days before the most important election [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=340.82s)]
*  we have in our country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=345.42s)]
*  Well, the DOJ needs to not do this tomorrow, and there are questions as to the legitimacy [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=346.9s)]
*  of the appointment of the special counsel as determined by the Florida judge, Eileen [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=352.9s)]
*  Cannon. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=357.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=358.5s)]
*  Jim Jordan, thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=359.5s)]
*  Joe Concha, thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrhfV6K81k&t=360.5s)]
