# Israeli special ops vet: We’re going to pick off every one of these guys
**Fox News:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ)
*  And during a visit to South Korea in 2022, yeah, that's when she commended the strong alliance between the U.S. and North Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is leading a foreign policy that would make not only America less safe, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=7.8s)]
*  it would make the entire world less safe. Here with reaction, Israeli special ops veteran Aaron Cohn, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=14.32s)]
*  Florida Congressman Michael Waltz. Congressman, your reaction. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=20.52s)]
*  Well, that's absolutely right, Sean. And we see it right now in the Middle East with this strike from Israel, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=24.0s)]
*  which they had every right to do to take out the number two official in Hezbollah, by the way, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=33.08s)]
*  who was responsible in large part for the 1983 Beirut bombing, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=38.44s)]
*  semperfied all the Marines and all the victims of that bombing for so long ago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=44.36s)]
*  Justice is finally done. But what is Kamala's approach has been to put more pressure on Israel, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=48.72s)]
*  to pander to the left with Gaza and humanitarian aid, to do nothing about Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=54.64s)]
*  And at the end of the day, what President Trump knew and why the Middle East was so stable under his watch [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=60.6s)]
*  was that it wasn't going to be solved in Lebanon, Gaza or the Red Sea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=66.32s)]
*  It was going to be solved in Iran, Iran, Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=71.68s)]
*  And because he had them broke, took out their field general, now they want to kill him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=74.92s)]
*  They are trying to assassinate him. And now the intelligence community is confirming that Iran is interfering the election. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=80.84s)]
*  If they can't kill him, they want to defeat him because they are the core root of the problem. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=87.88s)]
*  And Biden Harris refuses to acknowledge it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=93.28s)]
*  You know, Aaron, if Kamala doesn't want anybody to use the word radical Islamic terrorists, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=96.8s)]
*  well, then explain to me who attacked America on 9-11-01, who attacked Israel on October the 7th. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=102.04s)]
*  Can you explain that rationale? Because I find it incomprehensible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=109.12s)]
*  Well, Sean, it is comprehensible. And I agree with Congressman Walz, a thousand percent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=115.48s)]
*  The fact is, is that this was radical Islam, Sean. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=121.12s)]
*  Imad e Mughniya, who was the mastermind behind the bombing of the barracks in Beirut in 1983, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  came up with Fahd Shukr, who is the gentleman that we just magically made disappear in Beirut. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=133.48s)]
*  Keep in mind that Imad also mysteriously went missing in 2008 when he experienced some technical problems with his vehicle [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=140.48s)]
*  after our Mossad made him disappear as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=149.36s)]
*  We have a long list, Sean, of Islamic extremists who commit systematic terrorism against Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  But again, this all goes back to the big picture. This is Iran. Iran funds it. They support it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=159.28s)]
*  And at the end of the day, Israel is going to pick every one of those names off those lists, Sean, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  and we're going to keep hitting them. And we do it better than anybody. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Our Mossad has got the most actionable intelligence in the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=170.76s)]
*  And again, Congressman Walz knows this well, has a former Green Beret. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=174.16s)]
*  You have to be proactive with these operations, and Israel's not going to stop. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=178.4s)]
*  And every missile that comes out from the north in Israel is going to be responded to with selectivity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=182.28s)]
*  We're going to be very careful with the civilians in those areas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=187.68s)]
*  Beirut was very strategically targeted, but it sends a very strong message to Hezbollah, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=190.28s)]
*  and it should send a strong message to Kamala as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=196.96s)]
*  This is Islamic extreme terrorism, and we're going to knock it and pick off every one of these guys. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  This is why, what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done by pressuring Israel to show restraint. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=206.72s)]
*  And what they—the message should have been, go defeat the radical Islamic terrorists [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=212.68s)]
*  that killed the equivalent of 40,000 Americans in a day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  Go win your war. We support your victory over the war on terror. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=222.68s)]
*  And when you don't fight to win a war, then it goes on longer. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=227.24s)]
*  And incidents like that—what happened at that soccer field and the subsequent attacks by Israel continue. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=231.64s)]
*  If you're going to fight a war, win it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=238.4s)]
*  They should be thanking. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=239.68s)]
*  She should be thanking Israel, Sean, and every American should be thanking them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=242.2s)]
*  Sean, we're going to send her an invoice. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=246.2s)]
*  Sean, we're going to send her an invoice. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=249.32s)]
*  We're the big Satan. People forget that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  All right, thank you both. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=254.6s)]
*  For the most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=261.6s)]
*  most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, most interesting, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C9Fkck6ICQ&t=265.6s)]
