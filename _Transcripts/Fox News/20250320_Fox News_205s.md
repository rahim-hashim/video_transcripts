# 'NOT ACCEPTABLE': GOP governor says education status quo has to go
**Fox News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s)
*  Well, Governor, Kim Reynolds is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=0.0s)]
*  By the way, her state ranks in the top 10 in reading, despite spending far less per [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=1.6s)]
*  student than New York or D.C. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Governor, good to see you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=8.76s)]
*  I just have a novel idea. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=10.64s)]
*  I like to think out of the box occasionally, like I think Donald Trump does, although he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=12.0s)]
*  does at a much higher level. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=16.52s)]
*  But here's my thought. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=17.84s)]
*  If in New York you took, let's say, $30,000 per student, and let's say you had 10 families, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=19.32s)]
*  and those 10 families pooled their money, and then you'd have $300,000, you can hire [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=26.64s)]
*  two teachers for 120 grand a year, give them some benefits, some retirement, healthcare, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=31.6s)]
*  whatever they need, and that would be one teacher for five kids. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=37.04s)]
*  Which system do you think would work better, in your view, if you had to guess? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=42.88s)]
*  Well, return education back to the states. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  That's how we're going to fix this problem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=50.68s)]
*  And I'm so grateful to President Trump for signing the executive order today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=52.16s)]
*  I was joined by several of my colleagues across the country who are ready and excited about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=56.24s)]
*  having education returned not only to the states, but the school districts as well as [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=61.28s)]
*  to the parents. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  This is an expensive organization that has failed for over 40 years based on the own [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  standards that they put in place. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=72.68s)]
*  You are right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=74.88s)]
*  It's the very definition of insanity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=75.88s)]
*  And it is the status quo is no longer acceptable. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=78.0s)]
*  So I am so grateful to President Trump to give states the ability to streamline the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  process to make it more efficient and effective, just like we're doing in Iowa, where we're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=86.04s)]
*  giving parents the educational freedom to decide the best environment to educate their [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=90.84s)]
*  children, whether that's an educational savings account, charter schools, open enrollment, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=95.44s)]
*  home school, public schools. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  They choose where we're investing in evidence-based instruction and literacy and math. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=102.36s)]
*  And we're investing in our awesome teachers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=108.56s)]
*  We passed the largest salary increase last year in our state's history. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=110.88s)]
*  And we're really working on career paths. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  We have 90 percent of our high schools that offer work-based learning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=118.28s)]
*  We lead in registered apprenticeship programs. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=122.0s)]
*  Eighty-four percent do computer science. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=124.16s)]
*  So this will allow states to reduce the bureaucracy and the overreach and the regulatory environment, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=126.72s)]
*  take those savings that teachers and the State Department of Education and our school districts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=133.56s)]
*  are using resources for compliance to take those savings from that and invest it in the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=139.4s)]
*  classroom, invest it in instructional support for not only our students, but for our teachers [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=146.44s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  They want these kids to succeed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=153.4s)]
*  We want the outcomes to be better. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=155.28s)]
*  So let's lift them up and give them the tools so that they can be successful. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=157.12s)]
*  And that's what today's executive order will do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=163.04s)]
*  And we are excited about the opportunity. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=166.32s)]
*  The states will have the freedom to maybe come up with a million different ideas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=169.64s)]
*  You mentioned homeschooling. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=173.88s)]
*  You mentioned different—I mean, that's the beauty of it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=174.88s)]
*  And it's competition and it drives innovation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=177.92s)]
*  And it will drive outcomes, more efficient, more effective, with undoubtedly better outcomes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=180.2s)]
*  And again, I just—we're excited about the opportunity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=187.24s)]
*  Governor, appreciate you being with us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=189.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=192.16s)]
*  Governor Kim Wynne at Reynolds. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=193.16s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=194.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Ie47u2T2s&t=195.16s)]
