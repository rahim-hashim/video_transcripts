# The left is weaponizing their ‘words’: Sen. Tim Scott
**Fox News:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4)
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=0.0s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, let's start with you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=4.8s)]
*  Let's start with the security failures and the media reaction. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=6.96s)]
*  Kind of sick, isn't it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=13.0s)]
*  So, number one, the media reaction is sick. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=14.0s)]
*  If Tim and—if the shoe were on the other foot, you changed the labels, and Tim and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=16.36s)]
*  I said anything like that, or you said anything like that, would be driven out of politics, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=22.04s)]
*  probably rightfully so. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  One very prominent NBC reporter analyst said, will this change Trump's rhetoric? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=30.2s)]
*  The man almost got shot again, and the analysis of the media is, will Trump change? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  So here's my response. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=45.84s)]
*  Will the system change? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Will the people who accuse him of being a threat to democracy, will shut the hell up [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=49.72s)]
*  so people are not inspired to kill him? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=54.56s)]
*  We've had a lot of happy talk. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=57.16s)]
*  All the agents around the president, I agree, that whole team are great. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  They're wonderful Americans. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=63.64s)]
*  This was system failure at every possible level. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  How about this idea? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=69.4s)]
*  What if he had not put the barrel through the fence until President Trump got in front [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=70.82s)]
*  of him? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  That was just sheer luck. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  What if he had waited until President Trump finished the hole behind him and got right [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=77.6s)]
*  in front of him before he stuck the barrel through the fence? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=81.56s)]
*  The guy was there for 12 hours with an AK-47 with a scope on it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=84.56s)]
*  I've lost golf balls in that area. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=89.48s)]
*  How the hell could this happen twice? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=92.04s)]
*  So when I heard the acting director say, everything work fine? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=94.66s)]
*  No, man, you need to be fired. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=99.64s)]
*  You need to go. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=101.6s)]
*  Your reaction, Senator Scott. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=104.4s)]
*  Well, listen, don't ever forget the fact that the Bible tells us that Proverbs 18, 21, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=106.36s)]
*  that there's death and life in the power of the tongue. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=111.92s)]
*  What we're seeing being weaponized on the left is their words. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=114.36s)]
*  They literally continue to call former President Donald Trump a threat to democracy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=117.56s)]
*  You've got crazy folks who say, I've just been empowered to eliminate the threat to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=122.52s)]
*  democracy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=127.36s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=128.36s)]
*  It works when we see the liberal elite literally trying to take out a political opponent. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=129.36s)]
*  Now, do they cause it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=134.32s)]
*  Absolutely, they contribute to it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=136.36s)]
*  They are complicit with it because of their words. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=138.4s)]
*  Let me just say this, Sean, without question. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=140.84s)]
*  There's a party whose nominee did not get a single vote in a Democrat primary. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=150.16s)]
*  There was no Democrat primary. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=151.16s)]
*  The coronation ceremony with her becoming the nominee did not take a process. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=153.32s)]
*  That is the end of democracy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  When you're talking about the hypocrisy on the left, it's undeniable and hard to miss [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  that they literally wiped clean the slate of how elections are run in the United States [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=167.92s)]
*  of America. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=174.72s)]
*  But there are rhetoric. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=175.88s)]
*  It's not just over the top. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=176.88s)]
*  It is potentially deadly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=178.72s)]
*  We need to see it toned down starting on the left. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  I've already heard it from our side. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=185.6s)]
*  Every one of us wants to focus on the issues. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=187.88s)]
*  But every single time we see another attempt against President Trump, you got to ask yourself [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=191.2s)]
*  is there a plot to assassination attempts in six weeks? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=198.04s)]
*  If I were him, his family, or those who support him, you got to start thinking what's going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=204.4s)]
*  wrong in this process? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=210.56s)]
*  We need answers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=212.92s)]
*  We need them now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=214.04s)]
*  We need answers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=216.12s)]
*  We need them now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=217.12s)]
*  And that area should have been swept. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=218.12s)]
*  And we need an answer like tomorrow. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=219.96s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=221.64s)]
*  They should be before Congress. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=222.64s)]
*  Senator Graham, Senator Tim Scott, thank you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2a4c5PTk4&t=225.84s)]
