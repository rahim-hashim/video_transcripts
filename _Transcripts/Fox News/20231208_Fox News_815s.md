# Joe Biden's home is in the middle of Hunter's 'grift scheme': John Solomon
**Fox News:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4)
*  Joining us now, he is the editor-in-chief, the founder, investigative reporter, JustTheNews.com, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=0.0s)]
*  as we check in with John Solomon tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=7.44s)]
*  John, you have, more than any reporter in this country, been following this story and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=9.48s)]
*  have broken pretty much by yourself every big aspect of this story. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=14.84s)]
*  I want to go through this slowly, because I think there's so many parts of this that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=20.72s)]
*  people don't know about and that people have missed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=24.84s)]
*  Let's first go to the tax charges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=27.8s)]
*  Now, wasn't it David Weiss that was contradicted by the whistleblowers? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Didn't David Weiss originally plan not to bring any charges? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=34.76s)]
*  And only as a result of the whistleblower testimony did he then bring it to another [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  level, and that became the sweetheart deal that blew apart an open court because of a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=43.96s)]
*  Delaware judge? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=50.28s)]
*  Yeah, listen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=51.28s)]
*  First off, this indictment tonight affirms every fact that the whistleblowers, Gary Shapley [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  and Joe Ziegler gave. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=59.36s)]
*  They have been tormented by some in the media and certainly by Hunter Biden's defenders. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=60.76s)]
*  Their truthfulness is 100 percent confirmed in this indictment tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=65.28s)]
*  And they changed the course of history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=69.36s)]
*  David Weiss's team was content to give Hunter Biden a small misdemeanor plea deal for Hunter [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=71.24s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=79.52s)]
*  Now he's facing three felonies, nine charges, 17 years in prison. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=80.52s)]
*  They changed the course of history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=85.28s)]
*  So tonight, Joe Biden has a very bad mark on his record. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=87.46s)]
*  Now, just think about this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  This indictment portrays Hunter Biden as a quintessential tax cheat, a guy who'd rather [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=93.82s)]
*  spend money on sex gloves than pay his taxes, a guy who made millions in foreign money but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't pay his taxes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=104.38s)]
*  Even when he filed his own taxes from time to time, he would cheat even when he filed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  his taxes, the indictment alleges. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=110.02s)]
*  There's a very important fact here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=112.82s)]
*  In 2019, I reported, and I was ridiculed for reporting, that Ukrainian prosecutors wanted [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=116.06s)]
*  to tell the United States government that Hunter Biden did not pay taxes on some of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  his Burisma income. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=124.22s)]
*  Tonight, David Weiss's indictment, through the grand jury, confirmed by the grand jury, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=125.42s)]
*  confirms Hunter Biden did not pay taxes on the money he earned from Burisma holdings [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=129.94s)]
*  in 2014, just like the Ukrainian authorities tried to tell the United States government [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=134.46s)]
*  in 2019, but they were turned away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=139.34s)]
*  This is a devastating indictment for a president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=142.46s)]
*  His own son is portrayed as a tax cheat. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  This is a president that time and again has told us he wants to crack down on tax cheats, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=147.06s)]
*  he wants to hire 89,000 more IRS agents. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=151.46s)]
*  In this case here, his own son is the poster child for what a tax cheat looks like, at [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  least in this indictment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=160.58s)]
*  John, let me ask you this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=161.86s)]
*  I want to go back, because the years, the Burisma years, and this is where, almost from [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  the very beginning, this tipped everybody off, because it was so unusual. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=169.7s)]
*  So let me just focus in on that one deal in particular. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=175.34s)]
*  Am I wrong or right on the issue? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=178.54s)]
*  In October of 2015, didn't it become official Obama administration policy to give a billion [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  dollars in loan guarantees to Ukraine? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=190.18s)]
*  And that was after an interagency investigation, and they decided enough progress on the issue [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=193.42s)]
*  of corruption in Ukraine, warranted the billion in loan guarantees. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=198.82s)]
*  That happened in October of 2015. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=204.94s)]
*  You reported that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=205.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=206.94s)]
*  There were a series of record—September and October 15, on two consecutive months, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=207.94s)]
*  the Treasury Department, Justice Department, State Department agreed together that Ukraine [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=210.82s)]
*  and its prosecutor general's office had made enough progress on corruption reforms. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=215.14s)]
*  It deserved a billion dollars in new loan guarantees. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, Europe also concurred with that opinion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=221.62s)]
*  Let me ask you this, John, because then in December of 2015—this is the same year we're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=225.62s)]
*  talking about—Hunter is with Burisma executives. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=230.38s)]
*  This is at the time—and correct me if I'm wrong—this is at the time they needed D.C. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=234.3s)]
*  help, or maybe they needed the Biden brand, if you wanted to use Devin Archer's analogy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=238.82s)]
*  And at that time, they were in Dubai. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  Hunter was in Dubai, and Burisma executives were in Dubai. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=246.06s)]
*  And they had a phone call with Joe Biden. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=249.54s)]
*  Five days later, I believe Joe Biden went to Ukraine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  That's when Joe Biden was bragging about the issue, that in fact he said, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=255.34s)]
*  "'Fire the prosecutor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=260.14s)]
*  You got six hours or you're not getting the money.' [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=261.14s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=264.06s)]
*  He fires the prosecutor. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=265.06s)]
*  As a result of that firing, Ukraine got the loan guarantee, which was already official [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=266.74s)]
*  Obama administration policy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=270.98s)]
*  And Hunter Biden, who admits he had no experience on Good Morning America in oil, gas, energy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=273.58s)]
*  or coal, he continued to get paid millions of dollars for a job he clearly was not qualified [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=279.42s)]
*  for at a time where they're admitting that he was addicted to drugs and alcohol." [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  Is that the proper timeline on that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  That is exactly the timeline. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=292.94s)]
*  In October, Burisma started to get worried that the Ukrainian prosecutors were ramping [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=294.5s)]
*  up their investigation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  Hunter Biden starts talking to people around Joe Biden. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  One of Joe Biden's advisers talks to Joe Biden about it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=303.22s)]
*  The career people are recommending, give Ukraine the money. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=306.1s)]
*  They've done enough. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=308.54s)]
*  Joe Biden, according to The Washington Post, now The Washington Post has changed its story, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=310.5s)]
*  they now say that Joe Biden called an audible. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=314.1s)]
*  You know what an audible is? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=316.26000000000005s)]
*  A change in play at a football game. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  He called an audible and decided he was going to withhold a billion dollars and force the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=318.82s)]
*  firing of the very prosecutor that was making Burisma panic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  Hunter Biden's company was panicked and they fire Victor Shokin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=327.3s)]
*  That is exactly what I reported in 2019. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  And today the evidence validates that timeline. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  Let me go back. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=337.62s)]
*  So then, how is it that David Weiss, investigating this, how did he let the statute of limitations [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=338.62s)]
*  pass on the issue of taxes involving the Burisma years? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=346.78s)]
*  Because we're talking about millions of dollars there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=351.26s)]
*  Was that not the timeline? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=354.34s)]
*  Were those years, the statute of limitations passed there? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=356.06s)]
*  Because that would have been highly unusual, because they could have gone to Hunter Biden's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=360.34s)]
*  at the time and said, we're extending this or we're going to charge you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  Wouldn't that be the normal practice? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=369.14s)]
*  Yes, they do what's called a tolling agreement, which extends the statute. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  You keep negotiating, maybe you get a deal, but you preserve the government's ability [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=375.62s)]
*  to bring the charges. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  That tolling agreement, according to the whistleblowers, was allowed to expire in the fall of 2022, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=380.5s)]
*  meaning the $400,000 in income that Hunter Biden, today David Weiss confirms this today, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=385.7s)]
*  $400,000 in income that Hunter Biden got from Burisma in 2014 could no longer be charged [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=391.82s)]
*  as a felony tax evasion case. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=397.58s)]
*  Today, they mention it in the narrative, but they can't charge him with it because of the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=399.58s)]
*  fact that they allowed the statute of limitations to go. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=403.42s)]
*  And I think all of this would have been swept under the rug based on all the reporting I've [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=405.98s)]
*  done with FBI and IRS and other officials. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=409.06s)]
*  This would have all been swept under the rug if Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler didn't come [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=411.98s)]
*  forward and blow the whistle to Congress. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=416.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=417.78s)]
*  Let me ask you this next question here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=418.78s)]
*  Joe Biden has said over and over again, he said it as a candidate, he said it as a president, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=420.62s)]
*  he said it this week, that he never once talked to his brother or his son or anybody for that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=424.85999999999996s)]
*  matter about their foreign business dealings. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=430.78s)]
*  Now, we know that's not true, John Solomon. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=432.82s)]
*  We know because Devin Archer told us it's not true. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=435.46s)]
*  And he himself, as a partner, knew of at least 20 occasions when Joe got on the phone with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=438.46s)]
*  Hunter, their foreign business partners. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=443.5s)]
*  And then, of course, we have photo evidence of Joe Biden meeting with Elena Baterina. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=446.04s)]
*  That's the Russian oligarch, former first lady of Moscow, $3.5 million deal that they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=452.6s)]
*  did with her, later leading to her investing, I believe, over $100 million in a real estate [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=457.8s)]
*  venture with them. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=462.92s)]
*  But Joe Biden met with her at the Cafe Milano, didn't he? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=464.6s)]
*  And he met with other foreign business partners at the Cafe Milano, didn't he? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=468.04s)]
*  He did. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=472.2s)]
*  And he met with one in the Naval Observatory, the official vice president residence, when [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=473.28s)]
*  he was vice president, a guy connected to Kazakhstan. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=478.2s)]
*  Joe Biden is simply not telling the truth when he said, those are lies. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=481.68s)]
*  The only lies are his response to the day. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=484.68s)]
*  The evidence is overwhelming that he did meet, that he did get some money from his son. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=486.56s)]
*  Remember, he lied and said, my family never got money from China. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=491.24s)]
*  Today, David Weiss documents millions of dollars coming from China to his family. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=494.76s)]
*  And tomorrow morning, we're going to provide some new evidence showing that Joe Biden is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=499.32s)]
*  right in the middle of this scheme. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=503.2s)]
*  With the help of Senator Ron Johnson, we're going to be able to reveal tomorrow, there [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=504.88s)]
*  are six suspicious activity reports that came in from banks that were flagging two possible [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=508.88s)]
*  criminal activities, human trafficking and money laundering, that list Joe Biden's Delaware [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=515.88s)]
*  residence as the source and origination of the financial transactions that result in [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=521.88s)]
*  their concern. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's house was sort of a crime scene for these banks reporting possible money laundering [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=529.4s)]
*  and human trafficking, his home, the home that he allowed his son to stay in for some [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  It's listed in six banks, $12 million of transactions in these six suspicious activity reports. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=539.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the first time we knew that Joe Biden's house is in the middle of what banks thought [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=546.6s)]
*  were money laundering and human trafficking schemes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=551.72s)]
*  That's going to come out tomorrow morning. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=554.6s)]
*  Well, unbelievable. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  And your reporting has been dead on accurate. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  I will tell you, there also is this issue of David Weiss contradicting himself in separate [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  letters, I believe, to one senator, one congressman, and also the comments by Merrick Garland. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  Didn't Merrick Garland testify before Congress that David Weiss had the authority to charge [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=570.24s)]
*  in other jurisdictions? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=575.88s)]
*  That was what David Weiss was telling the whistleblowers that he did not have. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  He did not have the authority to charge in other jurisdictions, but he said something [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=582.06s)]
*  else to one branch of Congress and something else to a different branch, correct? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  The House and the Senate, not, you know, different houses. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=591.78s)]
*  There's a lot to sort out here, but other witnesses have affirmed the whistleblower [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=596.26s)]
*  story and rebuked both accounts of Merrick Garland and David Weiss. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=600.02s)]
*  David Weiss, I think, now has given a more complete account when he finally sat down [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=604.8599999999999s)]
*  with Jim Jordan, and he acknowledged this. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=608.98s)]
*  And I got turned down by the Biden appointees in Washington and California. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=610.9s)]
*  I then let the statute of limitations go. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  I couldn't even do things without getting the approval of the tax division that was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=616.26s)]
*  run by Joe Biden's appointees. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=619.66s)]
*  So Weiss has gotten the story right now. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=621.64s)]
*  His story matches the whistleblowers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  It matches the IRS and FBI supervisors and others that Jim Jordan and James Comer have [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=625.72s)]
*  interviewed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=630.54s)]
*  But early on, there was a lot of fast and loose. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=631.54s)]
*  The only people that turned out to be consistently accurate, the IRS whistleblowers. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, you have been following the story of Kevin Morris, who apparently made [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=638.06s)]
*  a loan of $4.9 million. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=641.78s)]
*  But as part of that, didn't you discover that one of the reasons he thought it was [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=644.5s)]
*  important to help Hunter out financially was because the issue of taxes would be front [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=649.24s)]
*  and center in the 2020 presidential race? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=656.06s)]
*  Yes, he actually writes an email saying that there's going to be political and personal [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=658.66s)]
*  peril for Hunter Biden if he doesn't start paying his taxes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=663.3s)]
*  This occurs right in 2020, right after he meets Hunter Biden at a Joe Biden fundraiser. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=666.3s)]
*  Those emails came out yesterday. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=670.9s)]
*  Kevin Morris is mentioned as an unnamed person here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=672.74s)]
*  The David Weiss confirms that Kevin Morris was starting to pay. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=675.74s)]
*  It's an unnamed person, but we know him to be Kevin Morris. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=680.06s)]
*  Started to pay Hunter Biden's bills, including his rent and his tax bills, starting in the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=682.54s)]
*  2020 timeframe. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=686.5799999999999s)]
*  So that story has now been affirmed, too. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=687.66s)]
*  There's a lot to dig in. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=690.0999999999999s)]
*  In any other presidency, if a donor came in and started giving millions of dollars to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=691.06s)]
*  the president's son or children or wife or brother, it would be a big scandal. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=695.54s)]
*  Most of the media have tried to ignore this over the last few weeks, but David Weiss puts [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  it front and center tonight in this indictment. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=704.3s)]
*  Is Joe Biden really the tip of the spear here? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=707.14s)]
*  In other words, we wouldn't be talking about any of this, would we? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=710.0999999999999s)]
*  If Joe Biden wasn't the brand, if Joe Biden didn't lie to the American people repeatedly, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=713.78s)]
*  why lie if you're not involved, right? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=719.14s)]
*  Why lie if you did nothing wrong? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=721.14s)]
*  Joe Biden lied to the country repeatedly, is lying again even this week on this very [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=723.26s)]
*  issue. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  Is it true that at the center of all of this is the president of the United States? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=728.8199999999999s)]
*  It involves, let's see, 150-some-odd suspicious activity reports, all of these shell corporations, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=733.5799999999999s)]
*  all of these Biden family members, including grandchildren that are being paid millions [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  of dollars from some of our top geopolitical foes, being paid into this family? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=746.18s)]
*  No evidence of any services that we can find rendered in exchange for that money? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=752.62s)]
*  Is that where we are now tonight, John? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=756.98s)]
*  Last question. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=759.14s)]
*  We are. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=760.14s)]
*  And listen, Hunter Biden himself admitted this in an interview two years ago. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=761.14s)]
*  A lot of things came his way solely because of his last name. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=764.86s)]
*  Yes, that's why he got hired. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=767.58s)]
*  Yes, that's why millions came into the family. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=769.02s)]
*  And they lied about it in 2019 and 20. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=771.78s)]
*  Certainly Joe Biden did. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=773.66s)]
*  And today the American public have a much clearer example of a grift scheme that the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=775.26s)]
*  Biden's ran that involved tax evasion now and also money laundering concerns at the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=780.86s)]
*  banks. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=785.1s)]
*  And Joe Biden's home is in the middle of it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=786.1s)]
*  That's going to be the big thing tomorrow. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=787.74s)]
*  Joe Biden aided and abated this scheme for a long time. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=789.46s)]
*  His family got rich off it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=793.74s)]
*  Now the last remaining question for James Comer, Jim Jordan, how much did Joe Biden [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=794.94s)]
*  personally benefit from it? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=799.42s)]
*  That I think the impeachment inquiry will ultimately be able to answer. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=801.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=803.7s)]
*  Now if he will use this as an excuse not to appear before James Comer's committee, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=804.7s)]
*  we'll watch that in the days to come as well. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=811.98s)]
*  John Solomon, thank you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfWjIVQAo4&t=813.62s)]
