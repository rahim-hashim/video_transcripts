# Mike Huckabee: This is tragic
**Fox News:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI)
*  outnumbered co-host Kayleigh McEnany and Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=0.0s)]
*  former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is with us. The word that I hear most [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  often is Kayleigh they are in a state of panic, complete state of panic and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=9.8s)]
*  frankly you can't blame them. How do they get out of this? I mean when 73% of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=15.52s)]
*  Democrats, Democrats say that Biden is too old to serve a second term that's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=22.88s)]
*  highly problematic. Now as to how they get out of this they have to have an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=28.56s)]
*  intervention. I agree with the assessment that Biden is far too hubristic, far too [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=33.4s)]
*  stubborn to ever step aside himself that in his mind would be tantamount to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=39.0s)]
*  admitting failure. Failure of his first term which we all agree and the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=43.56s)]
*  assessment of the American people agrees with that as well but there is going to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=48.04s)]
*  have to be an intervention from team Obama, from high-ranking Democrats, from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=51.4s)]
*  the Clinton team. There will have to be a moment where they come to him and say [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=56.4s)]
*  Joe you have to step aside or else you're looking at a Trump presidency [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  quite literally. All right Governor Huckabee I don't like to count chickens [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=66.36s)]
*  before they hatch however it seems that Obama and Clinton they're all in on his [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=71.24s)]
*  reelection as they are planning to step up and campaign with him and for him [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  maybe following Van Jones's advice which is hide him and let other people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=81.52s)]
*  surrogates go out there and do the talking for him. Will that strategy work? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=86.32s)]
*  You know Sean I think you're just way too harsh about Joe Biden. If you'd listen [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=91.44s)]
*  to medical experts like Rachel Maddow she even admits that you know he's very [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=97.28s)]
*  capable of being president because he rides a bike. Now what else do you need [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=102.72s)]
*  to be president of the United States than the ability to ride a bicycle for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=107.44s)]
*  God's sake and eat ice cream without a brain freeze. Did she forget he fell off the bicycle? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=111.16s)]
*  I mean this is the ultimate. He fell Governor, he fell off the bicycle we all saw it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=114.6s)]
*  You know and it is tragic and I'm sorry about him bumping his head and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=121.52s)]
*  tripping up the steps and all those other things. We laugh because it's the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=125.56s)]
*  only way we can cope with the fact that we have the leader of the free world who [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=129.0s)]
*  cannot complete a sentence. If you listen to his speeches from just three years [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=132.68s)]
*  ago they weren't great three years ago but they were coherent and now you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=137.39999999999998s)]
*  listen to him in a news conference or in a speech even reading from the prompter [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  today three years later and it is astonishing the difference and if anyone [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=146.7s)]
*  can't see that they're simply just ignoring reality. And Charlie we've [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  talked about this a lot. Charlie has every right to hate me because almost on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=158.62s)]
*  a weekly basis I have asked him whether or not he thinks that Biden's still going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=162.94s)]
*  to be on the ticket. If they wanted to get rid of him how does that play out? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=166.64s)]
*  Because I don't see his family intervening, not at all. You know I [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=172.88s)]
*  listen to the likes of Circleback Jen Psaki, you know the media mob. They'll go [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=178.44s)]
*  to any length to protect him. He's in great health. It's hard for me to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  keep up. Like I'm hearing this from a 30 year old you know young person. He rides [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=187.72s)]
*  a bicycle. Oh okay that proves everything that he's in great cognitive health. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=192.16s)]
*  The question is if they want to do it how do you do it and what about the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=196.28s)]
*  Kamala problem? She's had a 28% approval rating. Well I think that you know if [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=200.8s)]
*  they're going to get rid of him they're going to do exactly what they're doing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=207.76s)]
*  right now. If you think about the Democrat Party, the Democrat Party is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=210.68s)]
*  always all about control and what they need to do is they need to get through [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=213.88s)]
*  the primary. They need to get Joe Biden to collect all of the delegates needed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=217.88s)]
*  to nominate somebody and they have to take it to a convention and they have to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=222.48s)]
*  pray that nothing bad, nothing even worse happens to him between now and the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=226.76s)]
*  convention and then at the convention they can figure out a way they'll find [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  somebody you know the Democrat Party leaders who control everything will get [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=236.48s)]
*  in their smoke-filled rooms and figure out somebody Gavin Newsom or whoever [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=241.2s)]
*  that Joe Biden can then convey his delegates to. But I think for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=245.12s)]
*  them the real fear and the reason I think a lot of these people while [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=250.92s)]
*  they're you know raising alarm bells are not acting you know swifter and more [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  publicly against him is because they've got to do everything that they can to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=261.36s)]
*  make sure that they he gets through the the primary and to the convention [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  because if something does happen and Kamala Harris because you know she is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  hail and hearty and healthy she may not always sound like it she may sound [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=274.44s)]
*  drunk half the time but she's not you know she's pretty young and she's pretty [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=278.32s)]
*  pretty healthy she doesn't have the problems that Biden has and you know the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=281.68s)]
*  the idea of getting her out at a convention is I think pretty impossible [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=285.8s)]
*  you know I want the transcript but I also want the videotape from Robert Herr [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=292.0s)]
*  I mean they're denying that this happened with the special counsel the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=297.48s)]
*  angry and lashing out Kayleigh at the special counsel how about let the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=301.08s)]
*  American people read the transcript see the tape for themselves and then they [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=304.8s)]
*  can make the decision I think the American people deserve to be informed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=309.32s)]
*  about an issue you know of this level of importance and you know for the special [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=313.24s)]
*  counsel to write that and then say well he'd probably come off as a sympathetic [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=319.68s)]
*  old man nice guy but yet he was you know he fully was involved in the decision [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=323.24s)]
*  making as it relates to documents but no jury is gonna you know convict him [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=331.1s)]
*  just like no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute for Hillary and then the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  double standard with Donald Trump that's a lot for the American people to digest [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=340.42s)]
*  here I think yeah Oh total belief in the two-tiered justice system and in fact [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  you know his biographer destroying the tapes so it's incredible to the American [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  people to look at the two examples and Trump gets hit with 91 counts this guy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  But I totally agree with you we must see the transcript it is our only long-form [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=360.5s)]
*  opportunity to see the mental incapacity of this president I say the only one [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=365.06s)]
*  because you think that guy on your screen President Biden's ever going to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=370.18s)]
*  go toe-to-toe on a debate stage with Donald Trump he knows he would get [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=373.94s)]
*  smoked not once not twice but three times so that transcript is the only [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=377.26s)]
*  window the American voter has into the decline of this president well I've got [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=382.26s)]
*  to imagine and my understanding is there's a videotape of it also is it not [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=387.1s)]
*  I want to see the videotape there is yes all right so release that all of it well [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=390.94s)]
*  there's so transparent they promise transparency all right here's the deadly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=398.38s)]
*  exit question which everybody hates and you know it's coming governor does he [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=402.70000000000005s)]
*  make it to November is he gonna be on the ticket come November I doubt it a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=408.22s)]
*  month ago I just said he probably would but I think the deterioration what [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  happened last Thursday night was so stark so shocking and this report really I [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=418.70000000000005s)]
*  think just nailed it I don't see him making it all the way to the election I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=423.98s)]
*  don't know Charlie I think this was the worst week of the Biden presidency does [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  he make it and I think you might have vacillated a timer too but I'm not gonna [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=432.22s)]
*  hold you accountable I've been I'm like I'm like a cuckoo clock I've been I've [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=436.5s)]
*  given you every single possible answer but I am back with where the governor is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=442.78s)]
*  I don't think that he makes it and I think that you know the most startling [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  thing about what happened on Thursday last week was that when somebody said [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=452.34s)]
*  that he was mentally unfit he decides to call a press conference to announce that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=456.86s)]
*  in fact he is mentally fit to stand trial and then turns around and puts [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=461.58s)]
*  Mexico in the Middle East so that kind of answered the question for us I think [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=467.34s)]
*  well maybe you need to have an open mind about these things Charlie those type of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=472.14s)]
*  things can happen in the course of life Kayleigh you get the last word is he on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=476.34s)]
*  the ticket in November I up until last Thursday my answer was yes no doubt [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=480.58s)]
*  about it the man's too stubborn last Thursday changed everything that was the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=487.34s)]
*  heel-turn moment I do not think he will be the nominee because the Democrats are [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=491.7s)]
*  endorsing a massive massive all right now I have to ask a follow-up if it's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=495.78s)]
*  not him who replaces him governor Huckabee let me just announce it it will [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=501.7s)]
*  not be me I just want to make clear because I know a lot of speculation is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=507.9s)]
*  that I will be the guy but I won't be I don't think it's gonna be Michelle Obama [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=512.14s)]
*  there are a lot of people saying that but she hates politics I don't think she [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=517.22s)]
*  wants any part of it I think they're in trouble they don't have a bench I mean [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=520.54s)]
*  this is a bad situation you're a baseball team your pitcher has just [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=524.78s)]
*  totally thrown his arm and you look at the bullpen and there's nobody there who [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=529.22s)]
*  would it be Charlie I think if they can get it to the convention they're gonna [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=535.06s)]
*  try to do something as safe as possible and go with Gavin Newsom and deal with [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=540.02s)]
*  the fallout from not picking Kamala Harris I'm gonna bet Gretchen Whitmer she [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XiZcN8-DGI&t=545.54s)]
