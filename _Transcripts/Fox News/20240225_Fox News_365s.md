# Ron DeSantis: The Democrats are in a pickle with Biden
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc)
*  All right, joining us now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=0.0s)]
*  He was in South Carolina this week advocating for congressional term limits. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=2.72s)]
*  I still think back to that debate. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=6.96s)]
*  That was a fun night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=9.24s)]
*  I got to thank you, Governor, and the people of your state. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=10.52s)]
*  I've had a place in Florida for over 20 years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=14.08s)]
*  But now that I've moved down here, and this is my new home, full-time, best decision I've [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=16.76s)]
*  ever made, and everybody has been really warm and welcoming me, and I'm very grateful for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=21.96s)]
*  that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=26.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=27.88s)]
*  Well, no, we're glad to have you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=29.36s)]
*  You're not the only one, as you know. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=31.16s)]
*  I know you've had a lot of friends that have been moving down for many, many years now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=33.04s)]
*  You and I used to joke, when were you finally going to pull the trigger? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=37.76s)]
*  And you did. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=41.4s)]
*  No, you did. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=42.4s)]
*  But I'll tell you, you know— [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=43.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=44.4s)]
*  You jabbed me pretty good, and you— [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=45.4s)]
*  People down here, though— [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=47.4s)]
*  Because I kept threatening, I'm like— [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=48.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=49.4s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=50.4s)]
*  You kept saying, and we were waiting to see when it would happen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=51.84s)]
*  But I'll tell you on this newsome thing, you know, the Democrats are in a pickle, because [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=54.56s)]
*  on the one hand, you know, we see Biden six fries short of a happy meal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=58.64s)]
*  He can't even give a two-minute statement without them filming 20 jump cuts just for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=62.96s)]
*  him to deliver a certain message. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=68.16s)]
*  So, clearly, people see that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=70.16s)]
*  The media can try to dress that up, but voters are on to that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=72.04s)]
*  So they can look to someone like Newsome, who no doubt is a slippery politician. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=75.88s)]
*  He stood on that stage, and when we had the debate with you, and tried to tell people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  that somehow California didn't have a homeless problem, didn't have a crime problem, that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=85.36s)]
*  California had lower taxes than Florida, like, nobody believes this stuff, but he does [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=89.68s)]
*  do it in ways that are—that's slick. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=94.36s)]
*  The problem, though, I think, is he also stood on that stage when you pressed him, and he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=97.88s)]
*  endorsed Biden fully. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=102.48s)]
*  He said Biden was an A-plus president. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=104.12s)]
*  He endorsed all of Biden's disastrous policies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=106.76s)]
*  So, if he were to run, he would get saddled with all those policies, but then he'd have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=110.68s)]
*  to answer for California. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=115.16s)]
*  They have the biggest budget deficit in the country, $70 billion. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=117.2s)]
*  They have homeless problems. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=122.0s)]
*  They have an exodus of people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=123.4s)]
*  So in some respects, you know, it's the worst of both worlds. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  You have Biden's policies and that bad record, as well as all the California dysfunction. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=128.6s)]
*  And all we'd have to do is run commercials showing that San Francisco poop map. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=135.08s)]
*  And I think people would understand right away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=139.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=141.56s)]
*  Since, by the way, that debate, he's now signed a law allowing free health care to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=142.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants in his sanctuary state of California. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the country would have a hard time with that position alone. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Governor, if I owned a dog, and I love dogs, I really do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=154.56s)]
*  I've had three dogs in my life, actually four. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=158.44s)]
*  I loved all of them with all my heart. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=160.6s)]
*  I just think the world of dogs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  But if your dog bites one person, that's a problem. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=164.92s)]
*  How is it possible they allowed this dog to bite 24 agents before they finally said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=169.6s)]
*  maybe that's enough? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=177.72s)]
*  How do you, I mean, to me, at that point, it's criminal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=180.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=183.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, Sean, we recently, so I have a first grader, a kindergartner and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=184.96s)]
*  a preschooler, and we just adopted our first dog for the kids. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=190.8s)]
*  So we rescued a dog out of a dog shelter in Tallahassee. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=194.8s)]
*  So our kids are having the time of their lives. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=200.0s)]
*  I think all kids should be able to grow up with dogs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  But you've got to care for the dog. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think maybe what happened was this dog was just window dressing and they probably [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=206.56s)]
*  weren't giving it the type of attention. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  So it kept acting out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=212.8s)]
*  So I can just tell you this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=214.72000000000003s)]
*  You'd rather be a dog at the Florida governor's mansion than at the Biden White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=217.36s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  I know that you've been pushing, and I characterize term limits this way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=224.2s)]
*  And I know you're leading the effort to now maybe get a constitutional amendment on the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  issue of term limits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=235.12s)]
*  I've always said about it, it's a bad idea, because I'd like to believe that an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  informed public would vote people in and out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=241.4s)]
*  But we both know the power of incumbency and how difficult it is to beat an incumbent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=245.2s)]
*  However, I call it a bad idea whose time has really come. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=251.76s)]
*  And maybe if we sent people for a short period of time to Washington, maybe they would go [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=256.0s)]
*  with the, let me vote for the American people and my constituents with the understanding [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=261.08s)]
*  you're going back home to your real life in a couple of years so you don't have to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=267.64s)]
*  worry about reelection every second. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=270.6s)]
*  Well, first, on the issue of like voters get to choose, the fact of the matter is incumbents [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=273.12s)]
*  rig the process for their benefit. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=279.2s)]
*  So the reason why 98 percent of incumbents get reelected is not because 98 percent are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=281.58s)]
*  doing a good job. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=286.78s)]
*  It's because they've developed a system where it's almost impossible to defeat an incumbent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=288.3s)]
*  And so if it weren't even playing field, maybe that argument would matter. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=293.62s)]
*  Let me tell you this, Sean, we have term limits in Florida for our legislature. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=296.86s)]
*  What happens is people go, they know they're going to be there for a limited period of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=303.94s)]
*  So their incentive is not to be there the rest of their life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=304.94s)]
*  Their incentive is to make a difference. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=307.62s)]
*  Their incentive is to leave a legacy, tackle the big issues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=310.58s)]
*  And I think what you see right now in Washington is they always want to pass the buck. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  The number one thing they do is to just try to perpetuate themselves in office. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=317.02s)]
*  We've had an awful run over the last 20, 30 years going from six trillion in debt to 34 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=321.3s)]
*  trillion in debt. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=327.62s)]
*  Congress has passed some disastrous pieces of legislation over the years, and it's just [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  not working. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=333.74s)]
*  So I think that this is a reform. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=334.9s)]
*  And whether you think it's a bad idea whose time has come or a good idea whose time has [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=336.66s)]
*  come, I'll take any support we can get. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=340.02s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats across the country, voters, believe that term limits would make [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=342.58s)]
*  a difference, and I do too. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=347.58s)]
*  All right, Governor Ron DeSantis, great to have you back, Governor. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=349.06s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_FRGndjVc&t=352.7s)]
