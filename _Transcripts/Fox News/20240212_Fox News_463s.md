# Alan Dershowitz: This does require disqualification
**Fox News:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk)
*  And also breaking today, the judge that is overseeing Donald Trump's Georgia case has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=0.0s)]
*  said that the misconduct allegations against DA Fannie Willis could, quote, result in disqualification. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=6.82s)]
*  Now, Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade, they were subpoenaed to testify Thursday [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=13.8s)]
*  about their alleged relationship in court today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=19.18s)]
*  The judge declared a hearing on the matter, saying it must occur. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=22.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump was in Pierce in Florida today for a closed hearing on his classified [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=26.8s)]
*  documents case just days after Trump called on Jack Smith to immediately drop all charges [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=31.94s)]
*  against him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And also today, President Trump asking the Supreme Court to delay his criminal trial. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  This is the Washington case, so they can weigh in on the issue of immunity and the claims [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=43.5s)]
*  that he has been making and his case involving January 6th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=48.7s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction to all of it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=52.72s)]
*  Former senior adviser to President Trump, Stephen Miller, along with Harvard law professor [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=54.88s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz is with us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=59.88s)]
*  Well, I think the judge here is absolutely correct. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=61.56s)]
*  They got to get to the bottom of the misconduct issues, professor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=64.12s)]
*  I think it should result in disqualification based on what we know even now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=69.86s)]
*  And I don't know what that would do to the case at that point. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=75.72s)]
*  Probably they'd have to start from scratch, no? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=78.92s)]
*  It does require disqualification even on this record. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=83.16s)]
*  The judge said no, he needs to have a hearing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=85.8s)]
*  There are two issues. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=88.2s)]
*  One is, was there any financial benefit to the district attorney or to her boyfriend? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=89.66s)]
*  And that the judge will allow inquiry into. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=98.12s)]
*  But the even more important issue is, did either or both of them commit perjury or conspire [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=101.3s)]
*  to commit perjury when they allegedly stated under oath that their relationship became [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=106.88s)]
*  sexual only after he began working for her? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=112.8s)]
*  If that's not true, and there's apparently a witness out there who's prepared to testify [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=118.2s)]
*  under oath that that's not true, we may end up having a criminal trial, but not of Donald [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=122.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=128.24s)]
*  We may end up having a criminal trial of this couple for their perjury. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=129.24s)]
*  So the question is, what will be the scope of the judge's inquiry? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=134.0s)]
*  permit inquiry into the truth or falsity of the affidavits. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=138.8s)]
*  You can't allow the district attorney and a special district attorney to get away with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=144.12s)]
*  perjury if in fact they committed perjury. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=151.24s)]
*  And if they didn't, the record ought to be clear that they didn't commit perjury, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=153.08s)]
*  they had a platonic relationship, and it somehow evolved into a sexual relationship only after [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  he began working for her, which sounds very, very unlikely. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, that would be financially she's benefiting with these luxurious vacations. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=167.04s)]
*  Stephen Miller, to me, this case should go by the wayside. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Just like in so many cases, the document case, I think we now have proven when you compare [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=177.16s)]
*  the Trump case, the rate of Mar-a-Lago, you look at the pictures of boxes at Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=182.44s)]
*  compared to boxes that they found. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  Top secret classified information of Joe Biden seems exactly the same. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=189.88s)]
*  Alvin Bragg can't even think of what the real charges are, even at this late date. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=193.92s)]
*  I don't see a single one of these cases particularly strong, although I probably dislike the D.C. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=198.88s)]
*  case the most because I don't think he can get a fair trial there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, Sean, Alan laid it out perfectly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  Disqualification is obviously a must, and potential criminal charges could follow depending [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=214.88s)]
*  upon what is discerned and what is learned here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=221.12s)]
*  And as you mentioned, Sean, you're talking about allegations of self-enrichment as a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=224.04s)]
*  result of this prosecution. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=230.44s)]
*  The level of corruption that we are seeing in the effort to get Trump, to stop Trump, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=233.36s)]
*  to try to rig the Republican primary and then try to rig the general election through prosecution, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  law fairs, unlike anything we have seen before in the history of this country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  I've said it before, democracy is indeed on the ballot, but not in the way that Democrats [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=250.92s)]
*  say. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=256.04s)]
*  Because if Joe Biden and Willis and Smith and all of the other and Bragg and all the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=257.04s)]
*  other Democrat prosecutors that are trying to interfere and overturn American democracy [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=262.36s)]
*  are successful, then we will cease to live in a democracy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=267.92s)]
*  We will live in a country that is governed by the deep state and rogue prosecutors. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=271.28s)]
*  And that is why it is so essential that this case in Georgia be ended immediately at once [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=275.5s)]
*  and with prejudice. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=281.74s)]
*  You know, let me ask you, Professor, some people have called it law fair or the criminalization [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=284.34s)]
*  of political differences, but one thing is for sure. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=290.58s)]
*  We have a dual justice system. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=294.38s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, top secret, classified information on her servers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=296.66s)]
*  No reasonable prosecutor would ever prosecute. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=300.66s)]
*  And then, of course, deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, bleach pit, nobody ever heard of it, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  destroying devices with hammers, removing SIM cards. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=309.98s)]
*  Then you have the case of Joe Biden. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=313.42s)]
*  He's got top secret classified information in four separate locations, in boxes that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=315.54s)]
*  look just like the boxes at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=321.06s)]
*  There's no rate of any one of those locations and no indictment for either Biden or Hillary [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=323.66s)]
*  Clinton. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  So to me, if that's not a dual justice system, I don't know what is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=334.66s)]
*  I mean, it's sad. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=335.66s)]
*  Look, I read a whole book about it called Get Trump, obviously. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=336.66s)]
*  And there is a dual system of justice. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  And it was reflected by the Her Report, one of the worst reports by a special counsel [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=342.3s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=346.74s)]
*  He mistook the law. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=347.94s)]
*  He stated clearly that President Trump had done something willfully and intentionally. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=349.82000000000005s)]
*  And then he says, well, but maybe he was too old and he didn't have a good memory and he's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  likeable and he's forgetful. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not the standard for criminal prosecution. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=362.82s)]
*  The standard of intent and willfulness is minimal. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  Did he know that it was classified? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=369.05999999999995s)]
*  Did he know that he possessed it? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=371.58s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether his memory for events three years earlier or four years earlier [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  is a bit foggy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  This was a terrible report based on a misunderstanding and a misapplication of the law and lent cretins [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=379.82s)]
*  to the claim that there is a double standard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  And I think the case in Florida, the classified documents case in Florida, should be dismissed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=390.76s)]
*  as well, not only based on the failure to provide classified material, which is being [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=396.64s)]
*  litigated today, but based on the fact that according to the standards, the standards [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=401.08s)]
*  by the special counsel report, there shouldn't be a criminal prosecution in either case. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=406.68s)]
*  Let the public decide what they think, but let not the courts get involved and weaponized [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=411.36s)]
*  in this political effort. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=417.0s)]
*  There may be hesitation by the Supreme Court, but I do think they need to take up the immunity [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=419.64s)]
*  case. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=425.24s)]
*  We'll give you the last word, Stephen. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=426.24s)]
*  It's absolutely critical. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=428.24s)]
*  I hope and I pray the Supreme Court does the right thing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=431.2s)]
*  A president of the United States cannot function if a future party, in this case Democrats, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=434.24s)]
*  tried to throw him in jail for exercising his constitutional duties. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  It will be the end of the American presidency as we know it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=443.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=446.8s)]
*  Thank you, Boldt. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Stephen Miller. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=449.0s)]
*  Good to see you as well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3U-MYVaGNk&t=450.0s)]
