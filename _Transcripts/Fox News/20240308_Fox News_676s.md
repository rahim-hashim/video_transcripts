# Hannity: Biden just laid out his ‘radical wishlist’ for America
**Fox News:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=0.0s)]
*  We start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=2.92s)]
*  Tonight President Joe Biden laid out his radical wishlist for America. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=4.96s)]
*  His speech was so hyped up, it was bizarre. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=9.64s)]
*  I will not be shouting the whole hour. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  Frankly, so at odds with everyday Joe, it's even frightening to me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=15.76s)]
*  He spent most of the night shouting, speeding through his speech and clearly overcompensating [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  from the normal everyday Joe that can barely string two sentences together. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=27.84s)]
*  At times it became uncomfortable watching him screaming and yelling and speeding through [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=33.08s)]
*  that speech. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=37.52s)]
*  The AP affectionately called it feisty. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=39.2s)]
*  I guess that's one way to describe it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=41.96s)]
*  Tonight America saw, let's say, a very different Joe Biden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=44.2s)]
*  I might call him jacked up Joe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  And that's being charitable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=51.92s)]
*  He sounded like a hyper caffeinated angry old man. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=53.2s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on that coming up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  And in spite of what Joe Biden claimed tonight, sadly, the state of our union is not strong. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=58.68s)]
*  And sadly, politics was the clear agenda of the president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=64.3s)]
*  And facts and truth, that took a backseat to that radical agenda. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=68.84s)]
*  This was a DNC political speech. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=73.86s)]
*  Now throughout the hour, we will fact check the many falsehoods that the president declared [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=76.16s)]
*  tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=80.36s)]
*  Joe Biden's address was literally filled up with jacked up Joe screaming lie after lie. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=81.36s)]
*  So we begin to unpack the propaganda, the misinformation that will likely be ignored [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=88.28s)]
*  by much of the media mob. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=93.0s)]
*  Let's start with his lies on the economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=94.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=96.88s)]
*  My inherited economy is on the brink. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=97.88s)]
*  Now our economy is literally the envy of the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=100.8s)]
*  Fifteen million new jobs in just three years. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=103.68s)]
*  A record. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=106.4s)]
*  A record. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=107.4s)]
*  Wages keep going up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=108.4s)]
*  Inflation keeps coming down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3%, the lowest in the world and tending lower. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=111.76s)]
*  The landing is and will be soft. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  All right, here is the truth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=125.56s)]
*  Here are the facts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=126.56s)]
*  Since Biden took office, cumulative prices have risen over 17%. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=127.56s)]
*  Real hourly wages have only risen 13%. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=132.88s)]
*  About 60% of our fellow Americans, sadly, they are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Now costs across the board, they are surging. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=140.8s)]
*  Groceries are eating up more of the American people's paychecks than they have in over [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=142.96s)]
*  30 years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=147.88s)]
*  In fact, according to a recent study, Americans now need to make $11,400 more to afford the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=148.88s)]
*  same quality of life that they did in 2021. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  And his claims about job creation? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=159.24s)]
*  Another lie. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=161.52s)]
*  In reality, almost 10 million of those jobs are just, well, backfield jobs or temporary [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=162.72s)]
*  jobs that were lost during the pandemic. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=168.36s)]
*  And as we know now, many of those other jobs were part-time jobs going to many foreign-born [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=171.08s)]
*  workers that he's let into this country, unvetted illegally. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=175.96s)]
*  And don't forget about the Biden supply chain crisis, which has devastated our economy for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=179.36s)]
*  months on end. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  But seriously, they're blaming Biden's economic failures on, what, greedy corporations and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  shrink-flation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=191.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=192.48s)]
*  Too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=193.48s)]
*  less and less. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  That's where it's cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=202.4s)]
*  pricing from food to health care to housing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=206.0s)]
*  In fact, the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=208.92s)]
*  and put a hell of a lot fewer, same size bag, put fewer chips in it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=215.76s)]
*  No, I'm not joking. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  It's called shrink-flation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=223.48s)]
*  Americans are feeling the burden of Bidenomics day in and day out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=226.0s)]
*  And it's not because there are a few less chips in bags that you might buy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=229.24s)]
*  It's because of Joe Biden's failed policies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=234.2s)]
*  But this was only the tip of the iceberg in terms of Biden's lies tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=236.96s)]
*  He went back to his new favorite attack, blaming Republicans for the border crisis he [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=241.16s)]
*  himself created. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=246.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=247.2s)]
*  In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=248.6s)]
*  The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=253.88s)]
*  ever seen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you don't think so? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=260.48s)]
*  Oh, you don't like that bill, huh? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=263.48s)]
*  This bill would save lives from being ordered to the border. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=266.48s)]
*  It would also give me and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=273.76s)]
*  down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=278.76s)]
*  The Border Patrol Union has endorsed this bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  The Federal Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this bill. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  You're saying, no, look at the facts. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=288.6s)]
*  I know you know how to read. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=291.6s)]
*  I believe that given the opportunity for a majority in the House and Senate would endorse [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=303.8s)]
*  the bill as well, the majority right now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=308.68s)]
*  But unfortunately, politics has derailed this bill so far. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=311.48s)]
*  Wrong again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=315.48s)]
*  Since day one, Joe Biden worked to undo every Trump-era policy that he inherited. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=317.48s)]
*  And he did inherit the most secure border in history. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=323.76s)]
*  DHS Secretary Mayorkas even bragged about rescinding all of the Trump policies that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  actually worked. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=332.56s)]
*  So we have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, it would take so much time to list [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=334.56s)]
*  them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=342.56s)]
*  We rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=343.56s)]
*  We rescinded, of course, the public charge rule that deprived vulnerable migrants from [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=347.56s)]
*  accessing certain critical life benefits. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=354.56s)]
*  We have restored the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=358.6s)]
*  We have rescinded so many and have restored so many that he really dismantled. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=365.6s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen, Joe Biden ended Trump's efforts to exclude illegal immigrants [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=375.6s)]
*  from the census. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=380.6s)]
*  He strengthened DACA, canceled Trump's interior enforcement rule. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=381.6s)]
*  He stopped construction of the border wall. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=384.6s)]
*  He ended deportation protections for Liberians. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  He suspended asylum deals with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  He ended the remain in Mexico policy and let Title 42 expire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  For three long years, it was Joe Biden, his vice president, his Department of Homeland [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, all of their spokespeople telling you, the American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  people, lie after lie, telling you the border was secure and telling you the border was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  closed, which I showed you very differently. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=416.68s)]
*  That was not the truth and it still isn't. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=420.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=422.68s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=423.68s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=425.68s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=427.68s)]
*  Precisely that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=429.68s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=430.68s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continue to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=431.68s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=438.68s)]
*  The border. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=443.72s)]
*  We are working to make the border more secure. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=444.72s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=447.72s)]
*  We have a secure border and that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=451.72s)]
*  our administration. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=459.72s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=460.72s)]
*  And because of that, we now have nearly 10 million unvetted, illegal Joe Biden immigrants [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=466.72s)]
*  roaming free around the country, many from our top geopolitical foes, including Russia, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  China, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=476.76000000000005s)]
*  Biden does not need Congress to reimplement all of these actions and secure the border. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  Anyone in the administration that says that, like the president screamed tonight, that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  is flat out lying. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  Now, that's almost as big a lie as telling us that the border was secure for three years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=496.76000000000005s)]
*  It's sad and it has severe consequences. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden has created what is an unmitigated national security crisis. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=500.8s)]
*  In the words of some former top FBI officials, this is literally an invasion of military [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=505.8s)]
*  age men. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=511.8s)]
*  He has failed to stand up to our biggest adversaries on every front. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=512.8s)]
*  There has been no meaningful response to Iran or China's aggression. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=516.8s)]
*  Our adversaries are watching and they are frankly laughing at the pathetic and weak [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=521.8s)]
*  leadership that is Joe Biden. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=526.8s)]
*  Now, in a rather bizarre moment, and that was pretty much the entire speech, Joe also [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  attacked the U.S. Supreme Court and Supreme Court justices right there to their face. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  State laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  freedom. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  My God, what for? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  My God, what freedom else would you take away? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=557.88s)]
*  Look, it's a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=560.88s)]
*  The Supreme Court majority wrote the following, and with all due respect, justices, women [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=563.88s)]
*  are not without electoral power. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=569.88s)]
*  Excuse me, electoral or political power. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=572.88s)]
*  You're about to realize just how much you've overrided on that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=575.88s)]
*  It is another flat out lie that Republicans want to ban abortion and IVF. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=578.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, Joe Biden laughably also tried to play unifier and touted his bipartisan [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=586.92s)]
*  work. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=593.92s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=594.92s)]
*  According to a recent Fox News poll, Joe is failing massively on that front. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=595.92s)]
*  He's failing on pretty much every issue. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=600.92s)]
*  Just 26 percent believe he has successfully unified our country. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=602.92s)]
*  He has not. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=605.92s)]
*  Joe can't even unite his own party, let alone the country, losing tens of thousands [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  of votes to the uncommitted option in the Democratic primaries on Tuesday night. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  And tonight, prior to his speech, well, leftist protesters, they gathered to blast his stance [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  on the war in Israel. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  And then there's the polls. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  A recent Gallup poll has his approval at just a mere 38 percent, well below the typical [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  50 percent threshold that incumbent presidents need to win reelection. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=633.0s)]
*  A recent ABC poll found the staggering 86 percent of you, the American people, think [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=637.0s)]
*  that he is too old to run again on just about every single issue. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=643.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is deep underwater. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=647.0s)]
*  He is failing on every single front. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=649.0s)]
*  And Americans are not buying his lies, whether he whispers at him or shouts them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=651.0s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=656.0s)]
*  What Joe Biden said tonight, the state of our union under his failed leadership is [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=657.0s)]
*  anything but strong. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bykYc3kH8aU&t=662.0s)]
