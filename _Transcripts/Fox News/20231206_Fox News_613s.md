# Trump takes aim at John Kerry: 'What an idiot'
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0)
*  Welcome back to Hannity. We are in Davenport, Iowa with a massive fun crowd, a rowdy crowd, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=0.0s)]
*  and with GOP frontrunner President Donald Trump. Let me just throw out a list of some [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=6.0s)]
*  of the significant issues that we're facing as a country, and you've touched on a number [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=11.92s)]
*  of them. You mentioned borders day one. You mentioned energy day one. Look at where our [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=15.74s)]
*  economy is. Last year, $2 trillion in debt, $34 trillion overall. We, this year, Mr. President, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=21.94s)]
*  will pay, before we spend a dime, $1 trillion on debt service alone. Before Medicare, Social [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=29.98s)]
*  Security, National Defense. That is unsustainable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=38.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=41.9s)]
*  So, before COVID hit us, our gift from China, that was our gift. What happened to us with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=42.9s)]
*  COVID, commonly known as the China virus. They don't like that. But it was a China virus. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=49.22s)]
*  We were doing energy, taking our liquid gold out of the ground at a rate that's never been [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=56.42s)]
*  seen before, and it was going up. We were going to be using that liquid gold to sell [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=61.14s)]
*  to Europe instead of the pipeline from Russia, which I exposed and I stopped. You know, I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=66.06s)]
*  stopped that line. Then they say I was nice to Russia. There was nobody that was nice. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=70.86s)]
*  I was not nice to Russia. I stopped that pipeline. We would have been selling oil and gas to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=75.26s)]
*  Europe, to Asia, all over the world. We would have been paying off debt. That debt would [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=80.34s)]
*  be way down right now because we have more. What people don't know, we have more liquid [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=84.78s)]
*  gold than any other country in the world by far. And we started off in fourth place. We [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=88.98s)]
*  were number four. It was Saudi Arabia, it was Russia, it was two countries fighting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=95.3s)]
*  for number three, and it was us at number four or five. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  By the time I left, we were number one by 25 percent. We would have been number one [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=102.42s)]
*  by 100. And we would have done twice what they were going to do combined. We would have [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=107.38s)]
*  been paying off debt and we would have been reducing taxes. We gave you the biggest tax [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=112.42s)]
*  cut in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan tax cut. We would have been [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=117.06s)]
*  reducing taxes to further. And that's why, Sean, that's why we had the most jobs of any [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  president ever because we gave the we got rid of regulations. Tremendous. No president [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=126.14s)]
*  got rid of more regulations or clothes. And we gave you the big tax cuts. So everybody [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=131.62s)]
*  had incentive and everybody was happy and everybody was working. I remember groups came [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=135.8s)]
*  to see me that wouldn't normally like me. And they said, we've never seen anything like [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=141.62s)]
*  it. We were actually starting to get along. We got hit with the China virus. We were some [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=145.14s)]
*  people think purposely. I don't. I think it was incompetence. But some people think [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=149.54s)]
*  purposely because we were doing so much better than any other country ever. And we got hit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  But I will tell you, we would be paying that debt off right now at levels like never seen [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=160.26s)]
*  before. And it would have been a beautiful thing. You brought us to energy independence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  for the first time in 75 years before you ran. I remember we had many discussions about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=168.34s)]
*  energy independence, energy independence. And you're saying that you would in a second [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  term, you will push America to be the most energy dominant country on earth and that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=179.82s)]
*  you could pay down that thirty four trillion dollars in debt and we won't have a trillion [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=186.06s)]
*  dollar interest payment every year. That's right. We would get it way down. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=192.1s)]
*  So it's Biden inflation. That's what it is. What he did with energy is unbelievable because [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=198.58s)]
*  energy went up so much gasoline, five dollars, six dollars a gallon that that's what caused [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=205.86s)]
*  inflation. Now it's all over the place. But you have twenty nine percent total inflation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=210.9s)]
*  Now, when it holds up because the economy is starting to slow down very substantially. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=216.74s)]
*  So when it holds up, he's saying, well, we don't have too much inflation, but he doesn't talk [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=221.38s)]
*  about all of the inflation that you've had to suffer over the last three years. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=225.46s)]
*  Now, we will have numbers like you've never seen. We have a thing in Alaska called Anwar. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=229.22s)]
*  Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved. Everybody to push maybe a little bit. You know, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=235.86s)]
*  he didn't work his heart. But we have we have Anwar in Alaska, the biggest anywhere in the world, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=240.18s)]
*  including probably Saudi Arabia. I got it approved. I was so proud of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=246.82s)]
*  They ended it in the first week. They ended it. They termed. We'll get it back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=252.1s)]
*  But we have more than anybody. We have more wealth than anybody, but we don't use it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  And then guys like DeSantis and guys like many of the Democrats, but guys like DeSantis and to a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  lesser extent, Nikki Haley, they want to play around with your Social Security. You don't have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=266.42s)]
*  to touch Social Security. We have money laying in the ground far greater than anything we can do by [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=272.18s)]
*  hurting senior citizens with their Social Security. Ron DeSantis wanted to bring up on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=278.42s)]
*  Social Security. Now, of course, he says, well, I wouldn't. But, you know, one thing I learned [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  about politicians, I've known him, I've dealt with them on the other side for a long time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=289.3s)]
*  Their first thought is always the thought that they go to. He wanted to raise the minimum age, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=293.38s)]
*  the age on Social Security to 70. That's a big increase. But he also wanted to raise it to 75. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  If that happened, people would be devastated. We have such incredible wealth under our feet [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=304.82s)]
*  that that takes care of everything. It will take care of you know, if you go to Saudi Arabia [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=310.74s)]
*  and they bought many Boeings, many planes, and I said to them, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=315.62s)]
*  do you use financing for that? They didn't even know what the word meant. They have so much money. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=319.7s)]
*  They have a fund, 21 trillion dollars. It's all for oil. And we have more oil and gas than they do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=324.34s)]
*  Our country can be rich again. John Kerry has to be stopped. He's destroying our country. This guy, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=330.82s)]
*  I mean, think of it. He goes all over the world in a private jet, by the way. He goes all over the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=339.3s)]
*  world talking to these people about getting rid of coal plants. They all laugh at him. They, you know, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=344.58s)]
*  treat him with respect. He's gone. They say, what an idiot. What a jerk. And then they go ahead and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=349.3s)]
*  they build their coal plants. He goes to China about, let's say, the atmosphere. He talks about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=354.66s)]
*  global warming. He talks about all, you know, they don't call it global warming so much. Now [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  they call it climate change because it wasn't working. Global warming wasn't working when it [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=366.42s)]
*  was cooling. So now they call it climate change. That takes care of everything. I am an environmentalist, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  but we're going to destroy our country with this Green New Deal stuff that doesn't work. Just to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=376.42s)]
*  finish, we have so much wealth and power under our feet. No other country has it. China doesn't [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=381.46s)]
*  have it. Why are we going to electric? They do have what you need to do the batteries, but they don't [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=388.34s)]
*  have what you need to do the gasoline. We have, and it's what it's what people want to drive [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=393.78s)]
*  right now. And there's a little story about it, but you're going to see it a lot. I guarantee you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  They have so many electric vehicles. Nobody wants to buy them. They're expensive. Well, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=405.7s)]
*  they'll probably get them. By the way, nobody wants to buy them. 3000 dealers around the country [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  wrote Biden and said, please stop making us sell something with data. Want Ford lost four and a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  half billion dollars. Let me ask you this. You know, the government is subsidizing that a lot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=421.3s)]
*  They're paying a lot. Every time you make a car, we give you thousands and thousands and thousands [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=425.7s)]
*  of dollars and the people don't want them. And, you know, I'm not knocking electric cars. We [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=430.74s)]
*  should sell electric, but we should also sell a combustion engine gasoline cars. We can sell [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=436.02s)]
*  hybrids. The hybrids are fine. We should be able to buy everything. Some people might like an electric [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=443.38s)]
*  car. We should be able to buy an electric car. But to say that we're not going to do, and this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=448.98s)]
*  is our strength because we have this stuff under the ground and we have people going around [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=452.98s)]
*  really destroying our country. They're destroying our country at the border. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=458.98s)]
*  They've they will allow, in my opinion, because you don't hear the real numbers, 15 million people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=462.98s)]
*  into our country by the time Biden gets out, which hopefully will be very soon. If they get another [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=468.18s)]
*  term, this country is finished by the time he gets out and the people are coming from prisons [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  all over the world. They're coming from mental institutions all over the world and they're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=480.74s)]
*  terrorists. And this country is going to be suffering a very big price. It's amazing that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=485.38s)]
*  it hasn't happened. And interestingly, I had very strong borders, the strongest ever. We had the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=491.78s)]
*  strongest border in history. All they had to do is leave, leave Brandon Judd and leave Tom Holman and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=497.14s)]
*  leave all these guys. Let me put this up on the screen. Yeah, we had the strongest borders. Let [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=504.1s)]
*  me put this on the screen. Go ahead. We ran as the number one state sponsor of terror. Right. OK. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=508.1s)]
*  Well, foreign nationals founded our southern border because of Joe Biden's open borders [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=513.38s)]
*  from Iran, 659 from Syria, 538 from Afghanistan, 6386 Egypt, 3153, 12,605 from Russia, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=519.06s)]
*  26,113 from China. Now, could you explain to me, do you what do you think the odds are that among [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=532.42s)]
*  that group of people from our top geopolitical foes in most cases that terror cells have entered [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=542.58s)]
*  the country because of the eight million people Joe Biden has allowed into this country unvetted? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  What are the odds? The odds are 100 percent. Look, why do we have 26,000? How scary is that? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=554.1800000000001s)]
*  Think of it. It's 100. No, it's 100 percent. And by the way, we had nothing during my, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  remember I had the travel ban. I said, I don't want people coming from countries that want to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  blow us up. And we put a travel ban and some people thought I was discriminating. But think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX0pxRAM8-0&t=569.14s)]
