# Sean Hannity: This is a conviction without a crime
**Fox News:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=0.0s)]
*  We start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=2.62s)]
*  I have a travel advisory for New York City. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=4.28s)]
*  If you're a conservative or a Republican or a Trump supporter, beware in the weaponized [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=6.8s)]
*  Biden criminal justice system. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, political differences are now considered, especially heinous. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=13.92s)]
*  And if New York's powerful Democrats hate your politics, well, a prison cell might well [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=18.68s)]
*  be in your future or some kind of conviction for something, well, that they make up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=23.32s)]
*  Without a second thought, well, thoseâ€”these Democrats, they'll make up a crime, conduct [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  a show trial, rig a conviction with a handpicked Biden-donating judge, regardless of the evidence, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=32.96s)]
*  if they can even explain it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=39.32s)]
*  And just hours ago, the former president of the United States, now running for a second [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=41.0s)]
*  term, Donald J. Trump, was convicted on all 34 felony counts and will be sentenced, oh, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=45.84s)]
*  just a few days before the Republican convention. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=51.76s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=54.64s)]
*  But most Americans, including people in that very courtroom, can't even identify the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=55.8s)]
*  alleged felonies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=61.44s)]
*  That's because this is a conviction without a crime against Joe Biden's chief political [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=62.8s)]
*  rival in the middle of a presidential campaign. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=68.6s)]
*  The only so-called evidence was uncorroborated testimony, let's say, from a serial liar [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=72.32s)]
*  who admits he has an ulterior motive, who is even likely caught lying on the stand during [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=78.56s)]
*  his testimony, will see over time and is now also an admitted thief on top of everything. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  But of course, the left, they will celebrate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=89.72s)]
*  They will sing, they will dance, they will high-five, gleefully call Trump a convicted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=91.92s)]
*  felon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=96.84s)]
*  Now, they're cheering the end of what would be, let's see, equal justice under the law, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=97.84s)]
*  equal application of our laws. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=103.76s)]
*  Let me bear no doubt here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  This is a sad day for our country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  It's a sad day for our justice system, the best justice system ever created by man, the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=112.12s)]
*  foundation of our constitutional republic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=116.76s)]
*  It's literally dying before your eyes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=120.12s)]
*  Lawfare now rules the day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=122.4s)]
*  If a former president running for a second term with near unlimited resources can be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  treated like this, no one is safe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=129.6s)]
*  This should send a chill down the spine of every business leader and politician, not [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=132.12s)]
*  just in New York, frankly, because we have a weaponized Department of Justice under Joe [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=138.08s)]
*  Biden. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=142.0s)]
*  You step out of line, a corrupt Democrat of some kind, somewhere, will throw you in jail. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=143.0s)]
*  But if you beat the living hell out of a police officer or old people in New York City and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  it's on video, don't worry, no bail needed and a slap on the wrist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Is that justice to you? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  In this case, Bragg employed this novel, new, never applied before legal theory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  Again, never tried in U.S. history. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  He took a far-fetched misdemeanor, well past the statute of limitations, then magically [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  converted that into a felony with a federal law based on some nebulous, unspecified federal [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  election violation that was never charged or prosecuted, of which he has zero jurisdiction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Bragg then multiplied that same charge 34 times. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=189.2s)]
*  That's a shady maneuver called count stacking, the case that mysteriously made its way to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=192.84s)]
*  a far-left partisan judge named Juan Murchon, who, by the way, donated to Joe Biden, Murchon's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  daughter, a Democratic political operative, who reports say may very well profit from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=205.0s)]
*  this very trial. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  That would be cause for recusal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  But no one in New York's fake justice system saw this as what, a conflict of interest? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=213.32s)]
*  Remember, he was purposely picked for every single Trump-related case rather than having [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=220.28s)]
*  a pool that they chose from, as per usual course of business. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=226.56s)]
*  This was a dream come true for Juan Murchon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=231.4s)]
*  He never even tried to hide his bias, according to witnesses in the courtroom. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  Murchon just simply coddled the prosecution, allowing rampant speculation, irrelevant, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=238.32s)]
*  immaterial smears against Donald Trump. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=244.2s)]
*  He all but encouraged the prosecution to mislead the jury and insinuate that Michael Cohen's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=246.72s)]
*  election crimes were tied to this case. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=252.4s)]
*  He should be viewed as an accessory to the Trump crimes before the conviction. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  That happened earlier today. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=260.32s)]
*  Very different story with the defense. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=262.3s)]
*  Murchon actually blocked testimony from an election law expert, Bradley Smith, former [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=264.96s)]
*  head of the FEC. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=269.76s)]
*  He berated Trump's team and their key witness in front of the jury. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=271.23999999999995s)]
*  He rejected nearly every objection made by the defense. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=276.14s)]
*  He attempted to silence Donald Trump with what was a clearly unconstitutional gag order. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=279.56s)]
*  And perhaps worst of all, his jury instructions were completely unconstitutional, telling [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  jurors they didn't need to agree on what the phantom law was or the phantom underlying [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=290.48s)]
*  election felony is, as long as they agreed he did something wrong. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=297.04s)]
*  That was enough for a conviction. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=300.24s)]
*  And according to Juan Murchon, well, it did not need to be unanimous in the sense of what [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=302.56s)]
*  they believed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  Naturally, the jurors didn't even specify the felon in their ruling. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  In other words, Donald Trump was fouled. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=312.76s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=315.04s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=318.48s)]
*  Well, that is because it is insane. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=319.48s)]
*  First, we know from the 2020 Supreme Court ruling, Ramos v. Louisiana, quote, there can [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=322.48s)]
*  be no question either that the Sixth Amendment's unanimity requirement applies to state and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  federal criminal trials equally. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=335.24s)]
*  That's not all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  Here is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling from Andres v. the U.S., quote, unanimity in a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=339.16s)]
*  jury verdict is required where the Sixth and Seventh Amendments apply. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=345.08s)]
*  In criminal cases, this requirement of unanimity extends to all issues. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=349.96s)]
*  And by the way, character or degree of the crime, guilt, punishment, which are left to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  the jury. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  Let me repeat. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  In criminal cases, the requirement of unanimity extends to all issues. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  That's not what the judge instructed this jury. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=368.32s)]
*  Trump also has a right to know what he's being charged with. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=371.44s)]
*  He didn't know the whole time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=374.24s)]
*  According to Cornell Law, the Sixth Amendment of our Constitution grants all Americans, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=376.0s)]
*  quote, the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=381.56s)]
*  evidence against you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=386.56s)]
*  Apparently, this rule of law, that doesn't apply to Juan Merchan either. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  He ignored all civil liberties during his instructions to jurors. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=392.44000000000005s)]
*  Of course, it likely wasn't a problem for the jury. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  They barely deliberated despite the complexity of the novel legal theory at play, and they [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=399.96s)]
*  probably all hate Donald Trump. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=405.96s)]
*  So it was probably an easy sell. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=408.32s)]
*  Remember, New York City voted against Trump, well, almost nine to one. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=410.56s)]
*  You know, God forbid Trump got the change of venue that would have been the right thing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  to do, not when a political persecution is in the works. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=418.2s)]
*  No, that's not in the cards. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  For many Democrats, equal justice under the law is now completely tonight meaningless. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=423.62s)]
*  They just hate conservatives. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  They hate Republicans. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=431.3s)]
*  And they certainly hate anybody with the last name Trump above all else. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  They are desperate for one-party rule in perpetuity. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=436.68s)]
*  They're all hell-bent on using our justice system as a political weapon. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=439.8s)]
*  We've talked about the weaponization of our justice system, a dual justice system. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  It is all for them a means to an end. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, thankfully, New York City's far-left Democrats, here's the best part of tonight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  They don't have the final say. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=458.5s)]
*  Now, here's President Trump moments after the verdict. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=460.38s)]
*  Listen closely. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=463.26s)]
*  This was a disgrace. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=464.98s)]
*  This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=467.1s)]
*  This is a rigged trial, a disgrace. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=472.42s)]
*  They wouldn't give us a venue change. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=475.66s)]
*  We were at 5% or 6% in this district, in this area. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=477.7s)]
*  This was a rigged, disgraceful trial. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=484.82s)]
*  The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=488.38s)]
*  And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=493.62s)]
*  You have a so-respect DA and a whole thing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=497.62s)]
*  We didn't do a thing wrong. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=501.94s)]
*  I'm a very innocent man. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=504.06s)]
*  And it's okay. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=506.7s)]
*  I'm fighting for our country. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=508.18s)]
*  I'm fighting for our Constitution. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=509.34s)]
*  Our whole country is being rigged right now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=511.78s)]
*  This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt an opponent, a political [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=514.02s)]
*  opponent. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=521.38s)]
*  And I think it's just a disgrace. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=522.82s)]
*  And we'll keep fighting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=525.38s)]
*  We'll fight till the end and we'll win because our country's gone to hell. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=526.38s)]
*  We don't have the same country anymore. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=530.9s)]
*  We have a divided mess. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=532.7s)]
*  We're nation in decline, serious decline. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  Millions and millions of people pouring into our country right now from prisons and from [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=537.78s)]
*  mental institutions, terrorists, and they're taking over our country. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  We have a country that's in big trouble. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=548.38s)]
*  But this was a rigged decision right from day one with a conflicted judge. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  We should have never been allowed to try this case, never. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  And we will fight for our Constitution. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  This is long from over. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=561.4599999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=562.4599999999999s)]
*  This case is far from over, and you will get to render the final verdict in this case in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  158 days. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=571.86s)]
*  This case will be appealed. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=573.86s)]
*  Donald Trump will be vindicated. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=575.2600000000001s)]
*  I see no scenario in which this is not overturned. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=576.98s)]
*  That's almost a certainty. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=580.34s)]
*  But will it happen before the election or after the election? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=581.98s)]
*  All afternoon, all evening, people have been asking me, what can we do? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=585.5s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=589.46s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=590.46s)]
*  Well, as President Trump said, the real verdict will take place on November 5th. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=591.46s)]
*  And by the way, voting early, voting by mail, overcome your reluctance and resistance, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=597.42s)]
*  the system we're stuck with. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  We need legal ballot harvesting to match the efforts of Democrats, hopefully surpass them, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=604.42s)]
*  partisan observers to watch the voting all day and the vote counting all night. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=610.54s)]
*  But if you want this lawfare to continue, elect Joe Biden. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=615.0999999999999s)]
*  If you want the border crisis to continue, people coming from China, Russia, Iran, Syria, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=618.6999999999999s)]

*  They're unvetted. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=630.1s)]
*  If you like defund, dismantle, no bail laws, vote for Biden. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=631.26s)]
*  If you want more Biden inflation, reelect the guy that caused it, Joe Biden. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  If you're happy with the wars and the carnage overseas, Joe Biden's your guy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=640.4200000000001s)]
*  If you want all this, you get to decide, not 12 jurors in New York City. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=645.1400000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, it's your choice. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IYW06lwo60&t=650.34s)]
