# Kristi Noem's message to Dems: Respect the 'backbone' of this country
**Fox News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI)
*  All right, a big day here in the DC swamp where the mayors of several prominent sanctuary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=0.0s)]
*  cities were called to testify before the House Oversight Committee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=6.16s)]
*  Not surprisingly, things got a little heated. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=12.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=13.48s)]
*  Would you turn that criminal over to ICE? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=14.48s)]
*  This happened outside the city of Boston, but I can tell you in the city, whenever someone [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=18.48s)]
*  commits a crime, whenever there's a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=22.62s)]
*  If ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to hold, obtain a criminal warrant and the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=26.7s)]
*  Boston police will enforce it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=31.82s)]
*  Will you turn that criminal over to ICE? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=35.34s)]
*  We follow the laws. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=39.06s)]
*  I think that is enough. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=40.06s)]
*  Do you consider yourself a sanctuary city? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=41.74s)]
*  We do not under that definition. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=45.06s)]
*  You don't use the definition, you're not a sanctuary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=46.82s)]
*  We call ourselves a welcoming city. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=49.1s)]
*  We're not pulling a curtain back. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=51.06s)]
*  We have ripped the curtain from the rods. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=53.04s)]
*  We have revealed to America just how fast we could have secured our border if you had [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=57.76s)]
*  an executive that was willing to enforce the law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=64.5s)]
*  So now we're paying attention to our municipalities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=68.4s)]
*  And every one of them is loitered up, they've changed their narrative, you'll be held accountable. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=73.24s)]
*  One of you said you're willing to go to jail. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=80.16s)]
*  We might give you that opportunity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=82.33999999999999s)]
*  Mayor? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=84.24s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=85.24s)]
*  They should be deported. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=86.24s)]
*  Okay, mayor. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=87.24s)]
*  Any individual that causes harm and breaks the law should be held accountable. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=88.24s)]
*  This is why you have 6% approval rating, because you suck at answering questions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=93.24s)]
*  I do not think you guys are bad people, but I think that you are ideologically misled, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  which is why, unfortunately, based on your responses, I'm all going to be criminally [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=101.88s)]
*  referring you to the Department of Justice for investigation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  From all the mayors who are getting grilled, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=109.92s)]
*  she was up in New York City at the subway station where an illegal immigrant stands [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=113.76s)]
*  accused of lighting a woman on fire last year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=118.88s)]
*  She's back in D.C. from that trip. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=122.8s)]
*  Madam Secretary, it's so good to see you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=125.6s)]
*  I keep wanting to say, Governor, Governor. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I've got to get used to it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=129.08s)]
*  You can. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=130.56s)]
*  A lot of people are still making that mistake. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=131.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=132.72s)]
*  It has been so bad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=133.72s)]
*  During the campaign, I rolled not only Lake and Raleigh, Jocelyn Nungary and Rachel Moran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=135.72s)]
*  I rolled all the names. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=140.12s)]
*  And maybe I'll have my team pull up those scrolls. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=142.04s)]
*  All the names of all these people, murdered, raped, victims of violent crime. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=144.24s)]
*  What are you finding? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=148.04s)]
*  You know, I'm finding families like that all over America. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=149.6s)]
*  And their hearts are broken. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=152.16s)]
*  Their lives will never be the same. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=153.16s)]
*  And then they're living in some of these sanctuary cities where they have leaders that won't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=154.62s)]
*  listen to them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=158.44s)]
*  And that's what's shocking to me is, well, and even last night, this State of the Union [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=159.44s)]
*  speech, I just, I really felt like we, the Democrats are broken in a way that I've never [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=164.6s)]
*  seen that's unprecedented. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=169.12s)]
*  Just the disregard for human tragedy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's really what they showed last night. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=173.4s)]
*  But that's what I'm finding all across this country is people are sick of their leaders. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  They're sick of mayors like these that we had on Capitol Hill today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=178.88s)]
*  And they're done. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=182.06s)]
*  They're, they're waking up and they're very glad. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=183.06s)]
*  Listen, we do these raids on these criminals in these cities. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  People walking by on the streets, going to work in the morning, taking their kids to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  school. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  They stop and they go, thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  They're telling these officers that are standing there in their gear, thank you for doing this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=194.44s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=197.72s)]
*  So yeah, to hear that on the ground, I think is very different than what you hear when [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=198.72s)]
*  you're listening to Democrats. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=202.52s)]
*  Where's your, as a human being, where's your heart? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=203.52s)]
*  Where's your soul? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=206.4s)]
*  Where's your conscience? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=207.4s)]
*  You know, your compassion. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=208.4s)]
*  Democrats say they're compassionate and you don't stand for mothers that lost their children. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=210.28s)]
*  You don't stand for a little boy that beat cancer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=214.76s)]
*  You don't stand for a guy that lost his father and got into West Point. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=217.24s)]
*  You don't stand for a woman that lost her hero husband, police officer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=222.66s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=227.1s)]
*  When they walked, when the president walked in and they just didn't stand for him, out [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=228.1s)]
*  of respect for the institution, out of respect for the institution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=233.26s)]
*  I mean, that's at least decorum. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  I served in Congress when Obama was there and so many times he would come in for that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=238.62s)]
*  State of the Union speech and I knew he was lying to us and I knew he had a political [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  agenda and all that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=245.54s)]
*  But we gave him respect because this is the foundation of our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=247.04s)]
*  You know, this speech is constitutionally mandated and if you're going to be a part [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=251.36s)]
*  of it, then you follow the process. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=255.58s)]
*  And you can disagree on politics, you can disagree on opinions and policy, but boy, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=257.44s)]
*  respect the institution because it's the backbone of this country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=261.88s)]
*  I'm glad you are doing what you're doing and the thing that I fear is I think your [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=264.56s)]
*  task is so daunting because you were handed a mess, as the president likes to say. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=269.56s)]
*  And we have terrorists, cartel members, gang members, known murderers, rapists in the country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=274.44s)]
*  Okay, finding them is hard. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=280.44s)]
*  Now we have people that are working against you and this is a question I've asked you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=282.2s)]
*  before. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  Are we finding the people that are tipping off and putting ICE agents' lives in danger, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  tipping off the people that you're going to raid? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=291.56s)]
*  I have a couple of them identified that are within DHS and when I'm able to reveal that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  with the evidence, I'm going to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=299.76s)]
*  I'm going to make an example out of them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=304.2s)]
*  And just on the way here, I got another notification of another leak. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  And I can't do anything without it getting leaked and that's why we have to have so many [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=310.2s)]
*  ops all over the country all the time that it doesn't slow us down. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's one of the things, when I was in New York City today, I said to so many of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=317.36s)]
*  our law enforcement officers, I said, we don't have time to kiss each other's asses. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=320.44s)]
*  We just don't have time to sit around and we have to do everything we can every single [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  day because we might have another Lake and Riley tomorrow and wish we would have pushed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=330.12s)]
*  harder and wish we would have done more. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=334.44s)]
*  So these leakers, boy, they better watch out because we are putting just as equal effort [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=336.04s)]
*  into identifying them as we are these criminals that are out there raping and murdering people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, these leakers are more dangerous because it's a complete disregard [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=346.2s)]
*  for our law enforcement officers that are out there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=349.68s)]
*  Somebody's going to get killed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  They keep this up, somebody's going to get killed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  A law enforcement officer and a whole op is going to get blown where people are going [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  to die. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=357.04s)]
*  And it's because some... [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=358.04s)]
*  Are you going to stand on the road and keep doing that? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=359.04s)]
*  I am because I think that it means a lot to our officers out on the street. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=361.68s)]
*  I learn something every single time of ways we can be more efficient, what things I can [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxHSHFmUaI&t=367.76s)]
