# Hannity: This is getting scary
**Fox News:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4)
*  All right, this week's Biden's cognitive struggles were indisputable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=0.0s)]
*  If you don't believe me, let's run through a few of the examples. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=4.2s)]
*  Joe mentioned a couple. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Just last night, Biden confused the president of Mexico and the president of Egypt. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=9.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=12.92s)]
*  The conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip has been over the top. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=13.92s)]
*  I think that, as you know, initially the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=29.64s)]
*  gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=40.92s)]
*  I talked to him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I convinced him to open the gate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  He also made this comment while speaking in Virginia yesterday. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=49.84s)]
*  We didn't have time to play with all the breaking news. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=53.16s)]
*  Look. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  When I said, when I pushed all these programs, I said I'm going to be a president for everybody [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=56.52s)]
*  who lives in a red state or a green state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  I know it drives some of you crazy that a lot of these things are happening in red states, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=63.92s)]
*  but the Americans need help. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=69.0s)]
*  How many of you watching tonight live in a green state? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=71.68s)]
*  Earlier in the week, speaking at a campaign event in Vegas, Joe recalled having that conversation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=74.28s)]
*  with former French president Mitterrand in 2021. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=79.72s)]
*  The only problem is he died in 1996. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=85.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=87.32s)]
*  Right after I was elected, I went to what they call a G7 meeting, all the NATO leaders. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=88.32s)]
*  I was in the south of England. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=93.32s)]
*  And I sat down and I said, America's back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=97.32s)]
*  And Mitterrand from Germany, I mean, from France, looked at me and said, you know, how long you back for? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=101.32s)]
*  Now, this was not the only time Joe remembered having a conversation with a dead person this week alone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=115.32s)]
*  During a fundraiser in New York on Wednesday, Biden reportedly claimed to have spoken to the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=120.32s)]
*  while he died in 2017. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=129.32s)]
*  And at that 2021 G7 summit, it was actually Angela Merkel who was there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=131.32s)]
*  You know, look, if on a serious note in all of this, this is getting scary. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=137.32s)]
*  The Democrats are at the point where they can't deny what the world is clearly seeing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=142.32s)]
*  Remember, President Xi is watching, Putin is watching, Kim Jong-un is watching, and the mullahs in Iran are watching. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=147.32s)]
*  But it seems Democrats don't have the courage to do what is right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=154.32s)]
*  And here's how Axios put it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=158.32s)]
*  Quote, a former Biden aide described Democrats' dilemma. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=160.32s)]
*  Taking the nomination away from Biden is like taking the car keys away from your parents. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=163.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=168.32s)]
*  This is not about Biden's feelings. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=171.32s)]
*  It is about being the leader of the free world. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=173.32s)]
*  This is about his ability to be the president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=176.32s)]
*  Let me put it to you this way, and I'm being serious. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=179.32s)]
*  This is not a joke, to quote Joe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=182.32s)]
*  Would you hire Joe Biden to manage your finances? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=185.32s)]
*  Would you hire him, as I was asking Joe Concha, to drive your kids to school? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=188.32s)]
*  Or what about making life-altering decisions for you? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=193.32s)]
*  Do you think he's even capable of directing traffic at this point? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=196.32s)]
*  What about those nice people that you meet at the door when you enter a Walmart or a Target [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=200.32s)]
*  that tell you where you can find the department that you're looking for? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=205.32s)]
*  I don't think he'd be up to the job, because I doubt he could remember where all the departments are. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=209.32s)]
*  And by the way, this is not the Joe Biden of 2008, let alone 2019. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=214.32s)]
*  Just imagine, what is he going to be like in four years from now? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=218.32s)]
*  What is he going to be like? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=222.32s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjACJe0wBw4&t=230.32s)]
