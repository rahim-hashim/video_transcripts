# Trump calls Biden’s border executive order a 'joke’
**Fox News:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA)
*  All right, let's get right to part three of my interview with Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=0.0s)]
*  There's two issues we're going to talk about. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=4.84s)]
*  One is what I think the Democrats are going to run on, and one I think are what the issues [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=6.84s)]
*  you will be running on. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=11.14s)]
*  Democrats, democracy and peril, January 6th, abortion, abortion, abortion, all of these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  issues. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=20.76s)]
*  And then, of course, we have this, with 153 days out of the election yesterday, Joe Biden, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=22.76s)]
*  who had been telling America that the border's closed and the border's secure for over three [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=30.0s)]
*  years, and his vice president said it, and his spokespeople had said it, and his Department [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=34.52s)]
*  of Homeland Security secretary said it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=39.36s)]
*  Then, all of a sudden, they wanted to blame Republicans. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't have the power. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=44.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, they did undo all of your policies with the stroke of a pen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=45.6s)]
*  Now, finally, yesterday, he implemented a new policy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=50.24s)]
*  However, it's two million illegals a year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=54.24s)]
*  These are people who are allowed to come in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=58.48s)]
*  It's meaningless. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  It has nothing to do with border security. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  And he didn't need anything from Congress. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=64.88s)]
*  All he has to do is shut the border. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=66.28s)]
*  You say, shut the border, sign an order, and the border will close. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=67.84s)]
*  I did it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=71.8s)]
*  We had the best border, the safest border in history. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=72.8s)]
*  But your question is a large question because you're asking a lot of things. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=75.0s)]
*  Take abortion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=77.88s)]
*  For 52 years, people wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=79.72s)]
*  And the people that wanted to do it were legal scholars, lawyers, politicians. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=83.98s)]
*  Everybody wanted it to go back into the state system, not the federal system. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  Let the states decide. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=92.62s)]
*  Let the states decide. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  The people decide. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=94.94s)]
*  Let the states decide. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=95.94s)]
*  For 52 years, they fought it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=97.58s)]
*  I was able to get it done with the appointment of great justices, three great justices plus [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=99.18s)]
*  others that joined them, as you know. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=106.26s)]
*  And we don't have to go into all the names, but they're great. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=109.7s)]
*  And they had the courage to end Roe v. Wade, which really meant from a legal standpoint, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  it now goes back to the states. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=118.62s)]
*  And now the states are deciding. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=121.02s)]
*  And by the way, in many cases, like Ohio, it became, if you want to use the word liberal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=122.86s)]
*  or progressive, it was more liberal or progressive than people would have thought. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=127.98s)]
*  But the people of Ohio decided. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=132.14s)]
*  The people of Kansas decided. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=134.22s)]
*  The people are now deciding. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=136.46s)]
*  And it's taken it off the shoulders of the federal government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  Always they wanted it to be decided by the states. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=143.98s)]
*  And Roe v. Wade didn't do that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=147.38s)]
*  It put it into the federal government. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=148.94s)]
*  So now states are voting on it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=150.66s)]
*  And in many cases, it's more progressive or I like the term liberal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, they want to get away from the word liberal, I guess. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=158.06s)]
*  But it's more liberal in many cases, not in all cases. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  In some cases, they're going the other direction. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=164.77999999999997s)]
*  But the people are deciding. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=167.5s)]
*  And in many ways, it's a beautiful thing to watch. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=169.46s)]
*  So they wanted to, for 52 years, move it back to the states. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=172.02s)]
*  That's why they wanted to fight Roe v. Wade. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=177.86s)]
*  Then about 10 or 12 years ago, it started getting more complex. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=180.74s)]
*  They were talking about lots of different things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=184.52s)]
*  But remember this, the radicals in many ways are the Democrats of this issue because they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=186.62s)]
*  want to have abortion be OK in the eighth month and the ninth month and even after birth. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=192.26s)]
*  You're talking about, by the way, when you say that, you're talking about former Governor [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  Northam who said the baby will be born. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  Then in that case, the baby will be born, the baby will be made comfortable, then the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=203.18s)]
*  doctor and the baby will talk about it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  I had Gavin Newsom debating Ron DeSantis on this very show. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=209.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  I watched. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And it took a long time to get Gavin to answer, will you support any restrictions in months [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  seven, eight, and nine? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  And he at one point got annoyed because I kept going in for an answer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=221.9s)]
*  And the answer came back. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=226.06s)]
*  He goes, that is a decision between a doctor and a patient and their conscience. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  That means to me no restrictions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  I think the country probably is around where Dobbs is, but the states will decide it, as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=237.7s)]
*  you point out, because I do think it hurt the Republicans in 22. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=242.1s)]
*  It did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=245.74s)]
*  But I think the Republicans didn't know how to talk about the issue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=246.74s)]
*  When it came to things having to do with abortion, instead of saying the states will decide, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=251.26s)]
*  the states will decide, it really hurt the Republicans. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=257.86s)]
*  They didn't know how to talk about the issue. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=262.5s)]
*  And now I think they're learning how to talk about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  And all they're going to do is say, and they can campaign one way or the other within the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=266.78s)]
*  state, the states are all deciding right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=270.98s)]
*  And I think it's working the way that people wanted it to work. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=274.58s)]
*  And it's going to bring the country together on an issue that was very, very bad. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  But you mentioned when you about Gavin, I call him Gavin Newscombe because he's done [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=282.94s)]
*  a terrible job as... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=287.74s)]
*  For 30 years? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=288.74s)]
*  Yeah, another name. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=289.74s)]
*  By the way, $70 billion budget deficit. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=290.74s)]
*  No, no, he's done a terrible job in California. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=292.94s)]
*  One of the most beautiful places environmentally, from a weather standpoint, the ocean, the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=295.86s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  I have things in California. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=304.3s)]
*  But the regulation in California is just incredible what they've done to that state. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's just horrible. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=311.26000000000005s)]
*  And now people are moving out as opposed to moving in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  That never happened there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=315.22s)]
*  But you know, when you talk about the abortion, because it's an important thing to talk about, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  and a lot of people are afraid to talk about it, and a lot of politicians are destroyed [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=320.98s)]
*  talking about it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=324.86s)]
*  But like the exceptions, I like the three exceptions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=326.5s)]
*  And you have the three exceptions. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  Rape Princess Mother's Life. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=333.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=334.38s)]
*  You have the three exceptions. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=335.5s)]
*  And I think people, they have to follow their heart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=336.74s)]
*  They have to, you know, do what's right, what's right before their God, if they're religious [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=339.86s)]
*  people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=346.06s)]
*  But they have to follow their heart. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=347.06s)]
*  And I happen to believe, like Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan was very strong on the three [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=349.06s)]
*  exceptions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=352.58s)]
*  And I think you should do that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=354.1s)]
*  At the same time, you have to follow your heart. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=357.34s)]
*  And I think what's happening is everybody agrees pretty much that in the eighth, ninth, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=360.18s)]
*  and beyond, I mean, beyond is really an execution. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=364.5s)]
*  We're not even talking about the word abortion. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=368.14s)]
*  We're talking about an execution. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=369.82s)]
*  And the former governor, not the current governor, who's doing a very good job, by the way, he's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=371.66s)]
*  doing a very young kid, doing a very good job. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=376.06s)]
*  But the former governor before him said, you lay the baby down and you decide with the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=379.62s)]
*  mother what to do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=383.98s)]
*  The baby's born. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=385.22s)]
*  That's an execution. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  I think everybody knows that in the eighth month and the ninth month and beyond that, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=387.7s)]
*  I mean, hard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=392.62s)]
*  the baby after birth. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=397.14s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  It's like so many other things. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=400.82s)]
*  Open borders, crazy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  Men playing in women's sports, crazy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=405.5s)]
*  So I think the Republican Party has done an amazing job in certain ways, but they've never [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=408.58s)]
*  understood how to talk about, and I agree with you, it's hurt the Republican Party. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=414.14000000000004s)]
*  It's hurt some people. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=419.5s)]
*  Exceptions is very important. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=421.62s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=422.62s)]
*  But what we did is we took Roe v. Wade out of the federal government, put it in the states, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=423.98s)]
*  and now the people are deciding. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  And in some cases, not everybody's happy, but the people are deciding. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=429.98s)]
*  And I say, let the states decide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  This is every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=436.5s)]
*  And you know, I've been following the issue very closely, but over the years I've followed [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=442.42s)]
*  it less closely. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=446.46s)]
*  But I always noticed that they always wanted to move it back to the states. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=448.02s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=451.62s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=453.02s)]
*  And it's all happening. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=454.46s)]
*  And it's happening correctly. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=456.24s)]
*  And I wish that Republicans could talk about it correctly. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=457.9s)]
*  And if they would, you'd see it's a very different issue. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=462.34s)]
*  And remember, they're not really the radical one. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  The radical ones are the ones that... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=467.54s)]
*  No restrictions. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=469.58s)]
*  ... the one month, ninth month after birth, you can execute the baby. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=470.62s)]
*  Those are the radicals, and those are the liberals and the progressives. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=475.06s)]
*  And nobody wants to see that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=478.06s)]
*  Up next, I asked President Trump about Biden's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=479.85999999999996s)]
*  Straight ahead. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaUDJhPXdA&t=486.02s)]
