# DHS is 'doing everything' to find leakers, Kristi Noem says
**Fox News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks)
*  All right, the mainstream media mob won't report on it, so I guess that's our job. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=0.0s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=7.44s)]
*  President Trump has been in office just over a month, and the border is being sealed shut [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=8.8s)]
*  today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=13.24s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Border Patrol encountered [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=14.24s)]
*  only 200 illegals at the southern border on Saturday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=18.92s)]
*  That would be the lowest number of a single day in terms of apprehension in over 15 years, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=23.1s)]
*  Also tonight, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the Roosevelt Hotel migrant shelter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  They are going to close that in coming months, after hosting tens of thousands of illegals [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=35.76s)]
*  throughout the Biden years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  And the Trump administration is reportedly considering bringing back Title 42, which [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=42.68s)]
*  will again allow for the deportation of illegals on the basis of threats to public health. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=47.04s)]
*  DHS is also no longer allowing illegals to use. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=53.8s)]
*  The C-PB-1 app, the Biden app, to board flights without ID unless those flights are leaving [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=57.38s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=64.16s)]
*  And the message that the border is closed is being heard so clearly by would-be illegals [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=65.66s)]
*  right now that, according to the AP, they are literally turning around and making one [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  of the most, well, dramatic and dangerous parts of the journey north in reverse, because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=75.36s)]
*  they know they won't be allowed in when they get here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=80.9s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=84.58s)]
*  We're here now with the latest, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=86.36s)]
*  Noem is with us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=89.66s)]
*  Well, let's start with the good news. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Tell us about Saturday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's fantastic news, Sean, and a lot of fantastic news because of President Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=94.05999999999999s)]
*  You know, we only had 200 encounters at the border when, under the Biden administration, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=101.66s)]
*  on our worst day, we saw up to 15-, 16,000 encounters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=106.5s)]
*  So to have that kind of a drop under President Trump is because of a change of policy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=110.8s)]
*  It's because of telling the world to stay away. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=115.44s)]
*  If you want to come to this country illegally, you will be stopped because America comes [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=117.86s)]
*  first. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=122.44s)]
*  And it's because of President Trump, the fact that he is so firm and so confident and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=123.44s)]
*  he wants to uphold the law. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=127.8s)]
*  And he follows through with consequences if people don't. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=129.56s)]
*  So setting that record, the lowest number in 15 years, is remarkable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=132.44s)]
*  And the wins just keep coming because we have a president that believes in this country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=137.86s)]
*  And he listened to the American people, and he actually brought the kind of success that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=142.46s)]
*  this country was so desperate for. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  You're also getting help. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=149.78s)]
*  Your former state, South Dakota, Louisiana, Georgia, my home state of Florida, they are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=150.9s)]
*  now enacting mandates that local law enforcement cooperate with federal authorities to identify [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=158.46s)]
*  and detain illegal immigrants in the U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=164.9s)]
*  The new attorney general down here in Florida is working with Governor DeSantis on top of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Pam Bondi on the federal level, going after states like Illinois and New York and I'm [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=172.56s)]
*  sure many other states to follow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=176.88s)]
*  That's got to help your job, I would assume. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=178.4s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=182.44s)]
*  When you telegraph and have the kind of partnerships that we have at the state and the local levels, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=183.44s)]
*  it's incredible what you see for results. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  People know that when they break the law, what the law is, and that there will be consequences, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  and that not just in these local cities that have been so proactive to protect their citizens, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=195.7s)]
*  but also at the state level, we've seen incredible leadership out of governors and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  attorney generals who have stepped up and gone above and beyond to say, we listen to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=203.82s)]
*  our people, we recognize that our communities need to be safe, that we've got kids and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=207.77999999999997s)]
*  grandkids in this country that need a future, and that we're going to work and be proactive [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  to go after these criminals. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Remember, because they're so strong, Sean, we won't have to deal with families like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=217.54s)]
*  Lake and Riley's, like Jocelyn's family, that won't lose their children with no leadership [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=222.98s)]
*  that hasn't listened and enforced the law. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=228.22s)]
*  The scales of justice have been balanced again. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=230.34s)]
*  We're not putting illegals above Americans. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=233.46s)]
*  Now we recognize that every single person needs to be treated equally and equally under [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=235.9s)]
*  the law. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=240.5s)]
*  Are we finding, do you have an update, are we finding any of the people that are responsible [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=241.5s)]
*  for tipping off these gang members or cartel members that are in the country illegally [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=247.64s)]
*  and hence putting ICE officials' lives in jeopardy because they lose the element of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=256.28s)]
*  surprise? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=260.36s)]
*  Any update in terms of who's been tipping them off? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=261.66s)]
*  Absolutely, Sean. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=264.84s)]
*  I have found some leakers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=267.12s)]
*  We are continuing to get more. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=268.84s)]
*  They will be fired. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=270.76s)]
*  There will be consequences. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=271.76s)]
*  Remember, when they leak information to the press in order to blow an op, they are putting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=273.14s)]
*  law enforcement lives in jeopardy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=277.78s)]
*  They are risking their lives and putting their families in the position where they have to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=279.98s)]
*  live without those individuals any further. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=284.3s)]
*  So you bet we have used every tactic that we have. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=286.7s)]
*  If you remember, we talked just last week about how I'm using polygraphs to go after [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=290.26s)]
*  and to really interview these folks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=295.4s)]
*  Because we are a national security agency, I have that tool I can use. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=297.46s)]
*  People looking at their emails, looking at their communications, and it's amazing how [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  these bureaucrats who have an agenda to stop the work that we're doing to bring safety [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=305.64s)]
*  to America, how they will sell each other down the river if it's just to protect themselves. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=311.28s)]
*  So don't worry, I am doing everything to find these leakers and to get rid of them [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=315.76s)]
*  so that we can do our work and our law enforcement officers and agents can do it safely. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=319.55999999999995s)]
*  Isn't that a crime? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=324.28s)]
*  If you're tipping off gang members about a potential ICE raid and putting their lives [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=326.58s)]
*  in jeopardy, I've got to imagine that's a violation of some code somewhere. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=331.42s)]
*  Absolutely, and when they are breaking the law, we are prosecuting and holding them accountable [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=336.98s)]
*  to it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=341.38s)]
*  So, you know, we're not here to play games. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=342.38s)]
*  This is about America. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=345.02s)]
*  And any law enforcement officer that serves and partners not only with the Department [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=346.24s)]
*  of Homeland Security but partners with us, listen, we respect you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=351.78s)]
*  We honor the work that you do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=356.06s)]
*  We will take care of your family. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=358.14000000000004s)]
*  We will take care of you, and we'll go after those that threaten your lives by leaking [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  this type of information. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=362.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  What do you make of Eric Adams? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=365.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, in fairness to Mayor Adams, in the beginning, he was very sanctuary city. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Welcome to New York. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=373.62s)]
*  And okay, Texas and Florida started sending illegals up to New York. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=375.1s)]
*  Then they got overwhelmed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  And then he began to see the crime go up and the costs go up. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=380.04s)]
*  And they were overwhelmed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  He evolved in his position before the election, and now the Roosevelt Hotel is planned to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  be shut down. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=392.44s)]
*  And he's cooperating, isn't he? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=394.0s)]
*  He is cooperating. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=398.0s)]
*  He has been in communication with us. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=399.12s)]
*  You know, the night before I went to New York and was involved in some of those operations [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=401.4s)]
*  that happened, we talked several times on the phone. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  So he's wonderful to visit with, but also I need him to take stronger action, too. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=408.0s)]
*  The Roosevelt Hotel is going to be emptied out, and I'm thankful for that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=412.56s)]
*  That has been a haven not just for individuals that are here illegally, but for dangerous [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  criminals. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=421.12s)]
*  So the fact that that's going to be closed is a great and remarkable announcement by [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=422.12s)]
*  the mayor. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  But it's because of action that we took and President Trump took to stop paying the bill [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=426.44s)]
*  for people that are here illegally and to house them for the city. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=430.8s)]
*  So we're going to keep taking, that's right, you take the money away. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  It's amazing how quickly that these shelters and sanctuaries will be closed down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abt1JPiobks&t=438.74s)]
