# Fox News Primetime Recap - Sept. 26, 2024
**Fox News:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY)
*  But first, should have stuck with Joe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=3.0s)]
*  Now, for years at public appearances, Joe Biden was repeating himself, often speaking in gibberish. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=7.0s)]
*  Those are the words of Kajan, Kajan, Katanji, Drowned Jackson. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=13.0s)]
*  End of quote. Repeat the line. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=17.0s)]
*  Will not bring Israel, will not bring down, bogged out, will only bog down Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, they are about to contract a wicked case of buyer's remorse over at the Democrat Party [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=26.0s)]
*  because the new Emerson swing state poll shows that every battleground is tied except Georgia, where Trump is up by two. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=34.0s)]
*  The economy remains the number one issue in all of those states. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=42.0s)]
*  And of course, every poll shows that the public trusts Trump over Kamala on the economy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=46.0s)]
*  And other key metrics that spell trouble for Kamala and Waltz? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=51.0s)]
*  Well, Gallup is showing that the GOP has an advantage in party registration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=55.0s)]
*  And Republicans are making real inroads in Pennsylvania, eroding the Democrats' voter registration edge there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=60.0s)]
*  Democrats have never had such a small advantage there as they do now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=66.0s)]
*  And Politico is reporting that internal polling shows the Harris campaign is worried. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=71.0s)]
*  Read the piece, words like jittery and warning signs are used. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=78.0s)]
*  So 40 days out from the election, this is what Kamala Harris, all the support they're getting from the press [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=83.0s)]
*  and a huge money advantage gets the Democrats a tie? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=92.0s)]
*  Which begs the question, is Kamala really any stronger than Biden would have been? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=97.0s)]
*  In a few solo appearances she's done, the American people see what, a woman in charge? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=103.0s)]
*  Do they see a confident, smart leader with a bold vision? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=109.0s)]
*  Does she have a command of all the issues that matter? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=113.0s)]
*  Even does she know which branch of government authorizes spending? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=116.0s)]
*  If you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=120.0s)]
*  Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=126.0s)]
*  Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=129.0s)]
*  Okay. This was the friendliest of interviewers, by the way, and her goal was not to embarrass, but to help Harris. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=133.0s)]
*  And even then Harris couldn't handle it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=140.0s)]
*  There are lots of Americans who don't see themselves in your plans. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=143.0s)]
*  For those who say these policies aren't for me, what do you say to them? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=149.0s)]
*  Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you're in my plan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=154.0s)]
*  Another question, another tired cliche from Kamala, and a favorite new word. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=171.0s)]
*  Looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=177.0s)]
*  And just as Trump's team could turn Biden's own words into a compelling campaign commercial for him, well, last night, Kamala's own words wrote their own ad for Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=194.0s)]
*  You know, homeownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=205.0s)]
*  You know, gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=210.0s)]
*  She's too much of a dullard, I think, to realize that she trashed her own record there as vice president. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=214.0s)]
*  Or to take a few hours, maybe, could she possibly take a few hours to study the history of tariffs, which she's obviously just never bothered to do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=222.0s)]
*  Tariffs aren't unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He's actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on? Is there a good tariff, a bad tariff? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=232.0s)]
*  Well, part of it is you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board, and that's part of the problem with Donald Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=243.0s)]
*  But frankly, I'm going to and I say this in all sincerity, he's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=250.0s)]
*  And one must be serious and have a plan. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=258.0s)]
*  One must be serious. And what would she know exactly about a serious plan? After all, she lies about hers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=263.0s)]
*  Top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates to people at Moody's and Goldman Sachs, have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy, his would shrink the economy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=273.0s)]
*  Well, a few weeks ago, Goldman Sachs came out and threw cold water on her claims, calling them overstated. That's a friendly way of saying false. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=288.0s)]
*  But Kamala keeps citing him anyway. Why not? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=296.0s)]
*  Again, I ask how is any of this better than Biden? When he gets lost, he loves filling time with sappy sentiment that sounds like it was written by chat GPT. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=299.0s)]
*  Same with Kamala. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=310.0s)]
*  We got to remember with the United States of America, for God's sake, nothing, nothing, nothing is beyond our capacity when we work together. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=312.0s)]
*  We are an optimistic people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=321.0s)]
*  Americans by character are people who have dreams and ambitions and aspirations. We believe in what is possible. We believe in what can be. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=324.0s)]
*  And that was another sit down with a buddy. I have to remind you she couldn't answer the most basic questions about lowering the cost of living. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=338.0s)]
*  And that star studded forum was supposed to help her, but it didn't. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=346.0s)]
*  Even with the kind of what's your favorite color type questions, Kamala manages to sound like a total imbecile. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=351.0s)]
*  Why is joy important to you to insert into this election? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=358.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think and I'll say to whoever the young people are who are watching this, there are sometimes when your adversaries will try and turn your strength into a weakness. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=363.0s)]
*  Don't you let them. Don't you let them. I find joy in the American people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=372.0s)]
*  Vapid is my word of the day to describe her. But wait, you say Kamala did great at the debate. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=382.0s)]
*  Well, if she did, it's only because ABC refused to fact check her in real time. She lied and then she got away with it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=388.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, the candidate, has said in this election there will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=396.0s)]
*  Let's remember Charlottesville. And what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=405.0s)]
*  I lie, lie, lie. I mean, it's all the same. But of course, just like Joe Biden, she can read teleprompters. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=413.0s)]
*  But is this really that convincing? Today, she sounded like she was doing her best. Liz Cheney, let's go to war impersonation. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=420.0s)]
*  There are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=427.0s)]
*  These proposals are the same of those of Putin. They are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=441.0s)]
*  Yes, and I found my earring. All right. In other words, if Kamala wins, we're going to war with Russia, period, full stop. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=452.0s)]
*  If she sat down with an interview with any competent person in five minutes, I think he or she could force her into a corner, saying Madam Vice President, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=460.0s)]
*  If it's clear that Ukraine has no real chance of prevailing against Putin, as it increasingly looks like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=468.0s)]
*  do you intend to escalate the conflict, even if that means putting American soldiers at risk in a war with Russia? Yes or no, ma'am? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=475.0s)]
*  On all of these issues, she is far worse than Biden. At least Biden had his own views on issues like foreign policy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=485.0s)]
*  And remember, he slow walked the shipment of F-16s over to Zelensky. Her language today, though, was far more bellicose than Biden's ever was. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=494.0s)]
*  And that's just because she's a puppet of the war caucus. She doesn't care if we go to war with Russia or not. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=504.0s)]
*  So we'll see where things end up on election night. But right now, it seems the Democrats' trade of Biden for Kamala was a really, really dumb move. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=510.0s)]
*  She's just as cringe-worthy on camera as he is. She can't explain her own economic policy, and now she's running on a war with Russia platform. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=521.0s)]
*  This was not political genius by Pelosi and company, and it may have been political suicide. And that's the angle. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=530.0s)]
*  Kamala's first solo interview on a major news network bombed. Harris came in 13th place on MSNBC. More people watched the WNBA than Kamala Harris. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=538.0s)]
*  There's no appetite because we know what to expect, which is nothing. Kamala Harris isn't going to say anything for the rest of her life. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=550.0s)]
*  Even if she wanted to, she's not allowed to. If you're looking for a vision, a plan, an explanation about her past or even how she's going to accomplish what she wants to do, the only one who has the answer is Barack Obama. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=559.0s)]
*  Maybe you'll run into him in Hawaii, the place where he was born. Two days in a row, the New York Times agrees with Jesse Waters' primetime, quote, basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=573.0s)]
*  Alicited few details. A hard hitting Harris interview is still yet to come. Even CNN says Kamala Harris's interviews are biased, boring and predictable. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=589.0s)]
*  What I can tell from this interview tonight, which was really a home game, I mean, going on with this particular interviewer was like effectively interviewing with her campaign's press secretary. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=601.0s)]
*  She had nothing, nothing new to say on the economy beyond this ridiculous problem. You want to talk about aspirations and dreams? They're crushed in this country because of inflation and these kinds of interviews and the day that she had today are not going to solve it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=610.0s)]
*  She spent five days off the campaign trail preparing for this interview. And this is what she gave us. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=623.0s)]
*  We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=630.0s)]
*  A chance to pursue their dreams and aspirations. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=635.0s)]
*  We can do more to invest in the aspirations, the ambitions and the dreams of the American people. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=641.0s)]
*  We're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=647.0s)]
*  These are just buzzwords. Obama's people tell her to say because she doesn't have a grasp of the issues and she can't be honest about her agenda because it's too radical to be electable. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=652.0s)]
*  So the media has moved on to a new phase. Phase one was joy because she's not Joe Biden. Phase two was she's hiding from us, but that's OK. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=663.0s)]
*  She'll eventually come around. Phase three was she had a great debate, but we still didn't learn anything. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=674.0s)]
*  And we've arrived at phase four after a couple of interviews where she struggles to connect the dots. It's not her fault she doesn't answer questions. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=681.0s)]
*  One could watch that and say, well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer. That's OK, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=691.0s)]
*  Kamala doesn't need to be clear because the issues aren't clear. What's unclear about the issues? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=700.0s)]
*  They've lowered the bar so much that Kamala not talking about the issues isn't her fault. It's the issues fault. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=705.0s)]
*  She was asked about making housing more affordable. Pretty clear issue for people who can't afford a house. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=712.0s)]
*  How clear was she here? Listen, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state-led institutions. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=719.0s)]
*  And assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=729.0s)]
*  That includes prioritizing affordable housing. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=746.0s)]
*  What's holistic about housing? A yoga studio and everyone gets 25 grand to buy one. That's going to cost three trillion dollars. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=750.0s)]
*  She said everyone that wants to start a small business gets a $50,000 tax credit. All right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=760.0s)]
*  So I'm going to sell pickleball paddles on jessiwaters.com and I can write off 50 grand. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=767.0s)]
*  Johnny can sell fortune cookies on eBay and deduct 50 G's. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=772.0s)]
*  Just like that. Kamala says inflation is a crisis, but it's Trump's fault. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=777.0s)]
*  Then she says the border is broken and it's also Trump's fault. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=783.0s)]
*  What would a Harris administration do for those communities who have taken in many, many legal immigrants but are at capacity? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=788.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system and it needs to be fixed. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=796.0s)]
*  If we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=803.0s)]
*  Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=811.0s)]
*  And my pledge is that when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=818.0s)]
*  And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=827.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris led 20 million migrants into the country and spent three years lying that the border was secure. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=839.0s)]
*  Then blames Trump for not fixing it and says she's going to give everybody citizenship. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=845.0s)]
*  How are you going to fix the border? And her answer is sign a bill that didn't fix the border and can't pass? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=851.0s)]
*  Oh, and then mass amnesty? Everybody we let in gets to stay and vote, she says. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=856.0s)]
*  Biden and Harris are already doing it. Look at this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=863.0s)]
*  With an election looming, the U.S. is approving citizenship applications at the fastest speed in years. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=867.0s)]
*  Kamala's interview yesterday was so bad. Mark Cuban was sent out by the campaign to clean it up. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=874.0s)]
*  I don't think you can have an open southern border. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=881.0s)]
*  No, I agree. And she agrees, too. She said the exact same thing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=884.0s)]
*  He had a chance. Yeah, but Joe, you know, there's a lot of CEO's that when the CEO leaves for whatever reason, come in, take over and have completely different policies and approaches. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=887.0s)]
*  Right. That's just the way it works. When you're second in command, you do what your boss tells you to do. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=898.0s)]
*  He delegates authority to the border was supposed to be her. Yeah, but still the same thing. It's his policies. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=903.0s)]
*  Biden wanted to open the border. Kamala was just following orders. She's just so loyal. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=909.0s)]
*  But now she's an independent woman. And for the first time, she'll be going to the border tomorrow. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=915.0s)]
*  Right before the election. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the election. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=921.0s)]
*  Trump says not so fast for nearly four years. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=925.0s)]
*  We have been living through the worst border crisis in the history of the world. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=931.0s)]
*  There's never been anything like it, which has brought untold suffering, misery and death upon our land. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=937.0s)]
*  The architect of this destruction is Kamala Harris. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=946.0s)]
*  She lost 325,000 children. Think of that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=951.0s)]
*  Three and a half years. She lost 325,000 children. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=957.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris intends to stand before the American people tomorrow and lie. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=962.0s)]
*  She's going to lie just like she did about her job at McDonald's. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=967.0s)]
*  Just like she did about the 818,000 jobs that they created that were fake jobs. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=971.0s)]
*  They didn't exist. It's a fraud. And tomorrow she'll make a case that, oh, she did a fairly good job. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=977.0s)]
*  You can't say much. You can't justify it. She should save her airfare. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=983.0s)]
*  She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=989.0s)]
*  Trump's been boxing her in all week like this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=994.0s)]
*  Before her economic speech, he hit up grocery stores and factories. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=997.0s)]
*  Where have you been, Kamala Harris? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1001.0s)]
*  Before Kamala goes to the border, Trump comes out and asks, so what took you so long? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1004.0s)]
*  Fix it now. How can you trust the woman who broke the border to fix it? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1009.0s)]
*  How can you trust Kamala Harris on anything? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1013.0s)]
*  She told Oprah, if you break into her house, she's going to shoot you like Dirty Harry. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1016.0s)]
*  But in 2007, when she was San Francisco DA, she sponsored a bill to confiscate every handgun in the city. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1021.0s)]
*  Residents would have four months to surrender their firearms. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1029.0s)]
*  And then Kamala and the government would come and take them. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1033.0s)]
*  It was such a radical gun grab that even the gun control lobby was skittish. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1036.0s)]
*  She bragged about going into Americans' homes for their guns. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1041.0s)]
*  Just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1045.0s)]
*  doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1050.0s)]
*  This is a woman who wants to seize your handguns by force while she lets violent migrants into the country, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1055.0s)]
*  and she says, oh, and they'll be given $25,000 checks to buy homes in your neighborhood. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1061.0s)]
*  Oh, and they'll also be getting free sex changes on their way in. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1068.0s)]
*  She wants to give sex change operations to people in detention that came in illegally [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1072.0s)]
*  and are classified as illegal migrants. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1082.0s)]
*  If they want a sex change operation, she said, that's OK, we'll do that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1086.0s)]
*  This is a radically dark vision for the United States. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1092.0s)]
*  She is the most committed leftist a major party has ever nominated in the history of this country. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1096.0s)]
*  And what's even more dangerous is she's just so casual about it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1101.0s)]
*  Private health care? Just get rid of it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1105.0s)]
*  American oil? Ban it. Free speech? Eh, shouldn't be allowed to say that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1108.0s)]
*  Your 401K went up? Eh, we're going to take some of that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1112.0s)]
*  Your gun? Give it to me. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1115.0s)]
*  Girls' locker room? Sorry, not anymore. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1117.0s)]
*  Schools during COVID? Shut them down. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1120.0s)]
*  Prisoners? Let them out. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1123.0s)]
*  Prostitution? Legalize it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1125.0s)]
*  Heroin? Decriminalize it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1127.0s)]
*  That's how she talks. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1129.0s)]
*  The ignorant breeziness with which she just rips your rights away is pretty scary. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1131.0s)]
*  This lady with power? She'll be out of control. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1136.0s)]
*  There'll be no checks on her. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1139.0s)]
*  Whispers something to her ear? Fine, do it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1142.0s)]
*  No thought at all. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1145.0s)]
*  Harris is having a bad day? Watch out. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1147.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is like a child. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1150.0s)]
*  She hasn't put a single thought into anything and says whatever it takes to get a cookie. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1152.0s)]
*  She doesn't share. She tattles. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1157.0s)]
*  And on top of that, she's mean. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1160.0s)]
*  And she's not allowed to sit at the grown-up table. No way. Because she can't behave. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1162.0s)]
*  She's coddled, spoiled, and she's sheltered from real life. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1166.0s)]
*  She's like a child actress. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1170.0s)]
*  Feed her the lines and cash the check. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1172.0s)]
*  Also tonight, we will preview Kamala's bizarre trip tomorrow to the border. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1175.0s)]
*  The borders are. Might as well make the trip. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1181.0s)]
*  Maybe she'll even go to Europe 39 days before an election. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1184.0s)]
*  Gotta give her credit. That is a bold political move. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1187.0s)]
*  Now, first she lied to all of us for three and a half years. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1190.0s)]
*  Oh, the border's secure. The border's closed. Border's secure. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1193.0s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1196.0s)]
*  She said it over and over again. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1198.0s)]
*  Then Kamala said she didn't need to visit the border as borders are. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1200.0s)]
*  If she hadn't been to Europe, so Europe, get ready, Kamala might be coming. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1204.0s)]
*  Then she blamed Donald Trump for the border crisis. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1208.0s)]
*  Now she's headed to the border for a campaign photo op with 39 days to go [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1211.0s)]
*  because it has become such a liability for her. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1215.0s)]
*  Earlier today, President Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala's border folly. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1218.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1224.0s)]
*  She should save her airfare. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1225.0s)]
*  She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1229.0s)]
*  He can do it with the signing of a, of a, just a signature and a piece of paper to the border patrol. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1233.0s)]
*  Instead, she's going there to try and convince people that she wasn't as bad as everybody knows she was. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1240.0s)]
*  She was the worst in history. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1245.0s)]
*  They undid all of Trump's successful border policies with a stroke of a pen, as the president said. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1248.0s)]
*  Well, they can bring him back with a stroke of a pen. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1254.0s)]
*  Forget the trip to the border. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1257.0s)]
*  Go to D.C. Wake up, Joe. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1258.0s)]
*  Have him sign it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1260.0s)]
*  The border can be secure tomorrow. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1261.0s)]
*  We're going to have a lot more on the borders are. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1263.0s)]
*  Vipe VPs big trip to Arizona. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1266.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1268.0s)]
*  Thirty nine days before an election. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1269.0s)]
*  Now straight ahead. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1270.0s)]
*  That's coming up. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1271.0s)]
*  But our top story is something that has not received a lot of attention on other. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1273.0s)]
*  Well, let's call them the state run media mob networks. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1277.0s)]
*  Last night, the vice president went on MSDNC for her first and only national solo interview of the campaign. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1281.0s)]
*  It was with a friendly left wing host who wants Kamala to win, which is fine, and asked a lot of softball questions. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1287.0s)]
*  They don't really go on very long. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1294.0s)]
*  Very few follow ups. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1296.0s)]
*  It did not go well. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1297.0s)]
*  Here's Kamala testing out a big new word holistically. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1298.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1304.0s)]
*  Some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1306.0s)]
*  That includes prioritizing affordable housing. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1328.0s)]
*  Okay, I'll play. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1331.0s)]
*  How about a holistic look at Kamala's disaster at our border? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1332.0s)]
*  Millions of people let in, unvetted into this country, causing, let's see, a spike in housing demands. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1337.0s)]
*  We have four star hotels, New York City, around the country. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1344.0s)]
*  They're filled. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1348.0s)]
*  They're being destroyed, paid for by you, the American taxpayer school districts. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1349.0s)]
*  They're running out of money because of a massive spike in enrollment, predominantly in already in the state. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1353.0s)]
*  In already high need schools. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1360.0s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the problem of, you know, English as a second language. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1362.0s)]
*  And that means American kids are getting a lot less attention because of the influx of Harris Biden unvetted illegals and their kids and the health care system. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1366.0s)]
*  They're also overloaded by the increased demand. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1375.0s)]
*  They're now under financial stress because patients, they don't have insurance. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1378.0s)]
*  You're paying for that, too. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1382.0s)]
*  And increased demand on welfare and charities. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1384.0s)]
*  And by that also means that American citizens that are veterans, they're not getting the assistance they need. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1386.0s)]
*  There's not enough money to go around. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1392.0s)]
*  And then there's a spike in drug trafficking, driving fentanyl prices down from ten dollars a pill to 25 cents a pill, which means more Americans are dying. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1394.0s)]
*  Drug prices crashing. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1404.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1406.0s)]
*  Because of the spike in the use and record number of overdose deaths and hundreds of individuals connected to terrorist groups have crossed that border completely unvetted. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1407.0s)]
*  And I'm sure they're plotting and planning and scheming. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1418.0s)]
*  And it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when another 9-11 or worse happens. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1421.0s)]
*  And I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1426.0s)]
*  But I know I'm not wrong. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1428.0s)]
*  Small towns, big cities, they have seen a spike in crime. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1429.0s)]
*  And the South American and Venezuelan street gangs taking over areas, untold numbers of women and children and some men smuggled across the border being kept as sex slaves. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1432.0s)]
*  They are being forced into prostitution. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1443.0s)]
*  You have dozens of families have lost loved ones due to illegals, let's see, murdering their loved ones. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1446.0s)]
*  Dozens of women and children have been raped because of Harris and Biden and unvetted illegal immigrants coming into this country. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1453.0s)]
*  And of course hundreds of other Americans victims of other violent crimes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1461.0s)]
*  Holistically she has been a disaster. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1466.0s)]
*  Instead of a three and a half year late photo op trip to the border, how about she followed Donald Trump's advice, go back to DC, give Joe a pen, wake him up. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1470.0s)]
*  And all those Trump policies that were working that he undid and you bragged about undoing, too many to name as you once said. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1480.0s)]
*  Well, how about you put him back in place immediately, but don't hold your breath. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1488.0s)]
*  Now, last night, Kamala flat out couldn't even answer a basic, simple, fundamental question from one of her sick of fan supporters at MSDNC. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1493.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1501.0s)]
*  Expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned housing before giving that extra money for a first home. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1503.0s)]
*  If you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1509.0s)]
*  Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1516.0s)]
*  Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes and we're going to have to raise. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1518.0s)]
*  We're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1525.0s)]
*  That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1532.0s)]
*  I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1535.0s)]
*  Kamala corporations don't pay taxes. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1541.0s)]
*  They charge more for their goods and their services. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1545.0s)]
*  Maybe economics 101 would be a good idea. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1548.0s)]
*  Now, later on, MSDNC, even her sycophantic interviewer Stephanie rule out a criticize Harris for not answering any questions. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1551.0s)]
*  The New York Times even, you know, they weren't even impressed writing, quote, Ms. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1560.0s)]
*  Harris responded to the fairly basic predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1564.0s)]
*  Kamala even got fact checked by fake news CNN after lying about Trump's record on manufacturing jobs. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1573.0s)]
*  Everyone, even those who want her to win, I don't know who they are, understand that Kamala is a terrible candidate as she was a terrible and not well like vice president and even a worse borders are. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1579.0s)]
*  A track record is bad. Her beliefs are extreme and radical and frankly, if implemented, dangerous. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1591.0s)]
*  Her rambling and, you know, meaningless platitudes and bumper stickers and word salads make no sense. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1598.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a danger to the entire system of governance and capitalism as we know it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1604.0s)]
*  A blend of incompetence and New Green Deal Marxist radicalism. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1611.0s)]
*  The Harris campaign, meanwhile, makes little to no effort to clarify her true positions or they just flat out lie about what she really believes because providing taxpayer funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants or people in prison. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1616.0s)]
*  That's not a winning message, but that's what Kamala supports. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1632.0s)]
*  And based on her own words, we have the evidence. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1636.0s)]
*  She also supports what rewarding illegal behavior, not respecting our laws, border sovereignty, give you a pathway to citizenship. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1639.0s)]
*  That's called amnesty. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1647.0s)]
*  Along with the sex change surgery and housing and health care and education. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1648.0s)]
*  You didn't respect our laws. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1653.0s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1654.0s)]
*  Look at all of the other radical positions that she has taken and has never been questioned about banning private insurance. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1656.0s)]
*  No fracking, no offshore drilling, eliminate the filibuster to pass the 93 trillion dollar Green New Deal. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1663.0s)]
*  She supports gun confiscation, but she's packing and you better not break into her house. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1670.0s)]
*  She's going to blow you away. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1675.0s)]
*  Just ask Oprah and wants to raise taxes on all Americans, even taxing unrealized capital gains, which is a tax on theoretical money you haven't even made yet. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1676.0s)]
*  This would spell the end of capitalism, the end of the American dream. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1688.0s)]
*  Capitalism, the greatest wealth creating system in the history of mankind. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1693.0s)]
*  It's only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1696.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1698.0s)]
*  These policies are extreme, radical, and if implemented, they are dangerous. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1700.0s)]
*  She is a radical Marxist that wants to be president without telling you what she really thinks or believes. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1705.0s)]
*  Now, it's not theoretical, by the way. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1711.0s)]
*  We know what her presidency would look like. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1713.0s)]
*  The southern border was her responsibility. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1716.0s)]
*  She was supposed to find the root causes. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1718.0s)]
*  She failed and she failed miserably. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1720.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1722.0s)]
*  So Kamala finally did a national solo TV interview and unlike P Diddy, she didn't need any baby oil to slide through this one. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1723.0s)]
*  Before the interview, MSNBC's Stephanie Rule revealed her unique qualifications for the job on Bill Marsh Show. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1737.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1745.0s)]
*  She's running against Trump. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1749.0s)]
*  We have two choices. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1751.0s)]
*  And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1753.0s)]
*  When you move to Nirvana, give me your real estate broker's number and I'll be your next door neighbor. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1756.0s)]
*  We don't live there. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1762.0s)]
*  Okay, then I would just say this. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1764.0s)]
*  Did you ever play the game, Would You Rather? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1766.0s)]
*  Would you rather? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah, I play Would You Rather every time I put on MSNBC. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1772.0s)]
*  Would I rather watch that or start a juice cleanse before making love to Andrea Mitchell? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1777.0s)]
*  But voting for Kamala seems a lot more like a different game, like sorry or risk. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1788.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden was more of a boggle, trivial pursuit with time left over for operation. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1795.0s)]
*  So that's all Rule needs to know. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1802.0s)]
*  Kamala is in Trump and Steph's really passionate about Kamala avoiding the press, unless, of course, the press is her. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1804.0s)]
*  There she is. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1811.0s)]
*  But first things first, why is Rule wearing the latest from the Wednesday Addams collection? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1812.0s)]
*  Maybe she knew Kamala was going to speak less than Lurch. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1819.0s)]
*  RIP. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1825.0s)]
*  And where did they tape this? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1827.0s)]
*  The back room of a Home Depot? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1829.0s)]
*  I think they were both sitting on floor model toilets. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1834.0s)]
*  Anyway, onto the substance of the interview. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1840.0s)]
*  There wasn't any. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1842.0s)]
*  There was more fluffing here than in your average porno. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1844.0s)]
*  If Rule were any more of a plant, she'd require watering. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1848.0s)]
*  But at least I didn't hear the word holistic three times in 15 seconds. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1852.0s)]
*  And here I thought Jo was the stutterer. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1874.0s)]
*  She says holistically like she just learned the word holistically. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1877.0s)]
*  It was like I was in Spanish class when I finally learned the phrase el sexo anal. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1881.0s)]
*  Kamala also talked as if she hasn't been the VP for the past four years. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1890.0s)]
*  Instead, she sounded like a temp on her first day at a new job. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1894.0s)]
*  She says she wants to create an opportunity economy. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1897.0s)]
*  But like Jo, after a pint of strained peas and three insurers, she left a big mess. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1900.0s)]
*  But not everyone, you know, gets handed stuff on a silver platter. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1906.0s)]
*  And so my vision for the economy, I call it an opportunity economy, is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1909.0s)]
*  She's going to create an economy? She can't even create a sentence. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1924.0s)]
*  How about this? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1929.0s)]
*  How about this? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1930.0s)]
*  So just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1932.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1946.0s)]
*  Greedy grocers aren't the reason families need a co-signer to buy eggs, lady. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1951.0s)]
*  You think somebody who smoked as much weed as she claims would keep the price of snacks down? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1955.0s)]
*  Of course she wants those evil corporations to pay their fair share. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1960.0s)]
*  We're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1964.0s)]
*  That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1971.0s)]
*  I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1974.0s)]
*  Fair share doesn't mean anything. It's like saying I love you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1982.0s)]
*  For the phrase fair share is terminally subjective. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1991.0s)]
*  And like a book from Brian Kilmeade, no smart person buys it. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=1996.0s)]
*  Especially any adult who's been around kids where saying that's not fair is applied to everything, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2002.0s)]
*  including when I wouldn't pay the Boy Scouts I hired to wax my back because the experience should be payment enough. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2008.0s)]
*  Letting a Democrat decide what a fair tax rate is is like letting a junkie decide how much meth he should get for 50 bucks. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2014.0s)]
*  Here's more gibberish. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2024.0s)]
*  Tax deduction for startups to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2026.0s)]
*  but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2038.0s)]
*  Is it just me or do I feel like someone just roofied chat GBT? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2041.0s)]
*  So that's all we got. But how did Ruehl think it went? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2049.0s)]
*  Does she think one could watch and say Kamala didn't give a clear and direct answer? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2052.0s)]
*  But that's okay, because we're not talking about clear and direct issues. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2056.0s)]
*  One could watch that and say, well, she didn't give a clear direct answer. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2060.0s)]
*  That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2064.0s)]
*  Okay, flying none. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2069.0s)]
*  Her and Kamala should have a stupid off. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2072.0s)]
*  The issues aren't clear or direct. Inflation, crime, the border. What's unclear there? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2076.0s)]
*  I'm going to use that excuse the next time a cop asked me how fast I was going. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2082.0s)]
*  Just kidding. I have a driver. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0zEbZLcwY&t=2086.0s)]
