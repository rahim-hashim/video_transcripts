# NEEDS TO STOP: Hannity sends a message to Harris on anti-Trump rhetoric
**Fox News:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M)
*  And tonight, now listen to this, just one in four Americans say that the country is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=0.0s)]
*  headed in the right direction under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But Kamala doesn't have a plan to turn the country around. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=9.68s)]
*  Listen to the word salads. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=13.02s)]
*  Instead, she's serving up a hot, steaming pile of Hitler, Nazi, fascism comparison, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=14.36s)]
*  and when all else fails, calling Donald Trump a racist. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=22.44s)]
*  Her and her surrogates are the ones responsible for this final closing argument as we now, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=25.48s)]
*  you know, are 11 days away from Election Day. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=33.04s)]
*  Officially, although Election Day is every day, the polls are open. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=36.08s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=39.84s)]
*  And let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=40.84s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=44.44s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=45.44s)]
*  This guy's tendencies towards leaning towards dictatorship is un-American. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=46.44s)]
*  It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=50.56s)]
*  the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=66.08s)]
*  When you said we do agree, President Biden believes that Donald Trump is a fascist. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=67.08s)]
*  I mean, yes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=72.2s)]
*  I actually wish they would speak that harshly to the number one state sponsor of terror [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=74.2s)]
*  and the mulls in Iran, but I'm not going to hold my breath. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=79.48s)]
*  Now, of course, Hillary Clinton, she also had to chime in, still bitter about her humiliating [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=82.84s)]
*  loss in 2016. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=88.08s)]
*  She's now comparing Donald Trump and his supporters to Nazis, all on Kamala's behalf. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=90.08s)]
*  Because of the upcoming Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, take a listen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=95.92s)]
*  One other thing that you'll see next week, Caitlin, is Trump actually reenacting the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  Madison Square Garden rally in 1939. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  I write about this in my book. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-Nazis, fascists in America were lining [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=117.52s)]
*  up to essentially pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=125.48s)]
*  in Germany. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=132.36s)]
*  It may be a leap for some people, and a lot of others may think, I don't want to go [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=133.36s)]
*  there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=138.6s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=139.6s)]
*  But please, open your eyes to the danger that this man poses to our country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=140.6s)]
*  There is no president in the modern era that has been as good a friend and close an ally [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=148.08s)]
*  to Israel as Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  Many presidents have promised to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=157.12s)]
*  Donald Trump got it done. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=163.0s)]
*  Donald Trump recognized Israel's right to the Golan Heights and the West Bank. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=164.68s)]
*  And Israel's never had a better friend in the White House. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=170.28s)]
*  This kind of dishonest political rhetoric, it is disgraceful, it is repulsive, and frankly, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=173.24s)]
*  it is dangerous. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=180.44000000000003s)]
*  Now, there are many deranged people, unfortunately, in our country that will listen to her words [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=181.52s)]
*  and to Carvel's words and to Kamala's words and Walz's words, and they hear these words, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=187.88s)]
*  are they going to be inspired by them? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=194.96s)]
*  This is not new. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=197.28s)]
*  Now, take a look at your screen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=198.28s)]
*  Democrats, they have been comparing Republicans to Nazis for decades. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=200.04s)]
*  They compared Mitt Romney to Hitler, somebody they say they love now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=203.6s)]
*  They did the same thing to John McCain, who they used to love until he ran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=208.0s)]
*  They didn't love him, then they loved him again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=211.4s)]
*  They did it to George W. Bush. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=213.68s)]
*  They did it to George H. W. Bush. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=215.34s)]
*  You know, one Democrat accused Ronald Reagan of trying to replace the Bill of Rights with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=218.48s)]
*  Mein Kampf. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater in 1964, all compared numerous times to Adolf [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=224.0s)]
*  Hitler. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=231.4s)]
*  And that is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=232.4s)]
*  Everyone from Nikki Haley to Governor Ron DeSantis to Kamala's new friend Dick Cheney [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=234.4s)]
*  have all been compared to Nazis by Democrats. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  But this time, it's a lot different. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=243.82s)]
*  Now, two people have already tried to assassinate Donald Trump during this election cycle. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  A Trump supporter was murdered, others were seriously wounded, and yet top Democrats, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  they are ramping up out of pure panic and a desire for political power, their rhetoric, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=257.98s)]
*  calling Trump a fascist, as many of her surrogates are doing the same, her surrogates comparing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  him to Hitler, and her supporters calling him Nazi. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  Right now, there are delusional people that are out there that are hearing these words. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=275.44s)]
*  We have foreign actors that we know about in this country, including Iranian assassination [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=281.44s)]
*  squads who are targeting Donald Trump, targeting his family, targeting his campaign team. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=287.44s)]
*  They know all of this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=294.76s)]
*  They get security briefings, and they obviously do not care. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=296.56s)]
*  This insane, never-ending, absolutely dangerous rhetoric, they talk about Donald Trump's rhetoric. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=302.12s)]
*  What about their rhetoric? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=310.32s)]
*  It has the potential to put Donald Trump, his family, his supporters, his campaign staff, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=312.04s)]
*  everybody around him, their lives at risk, and Kamala, it needs to stop, and it needs [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=319.04s)]
*  to stop immediately, and you need to lead the way, and you need to stop calling him [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=325.68s)]
*  a fascist. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  And Hillary Clinton, well, you have no shame, but you should be ashamed of yourself, as [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  well as everybody else that is out there using these terms. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=336.76s)]
*  Repulsive, reckless, dangerous, beyond irresponsible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=340.72s)]
*  In a rare move, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, or Minority [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=345.68s)]
*  Leader Mitch McConnell, released a joint letter demanding that Harris, quote, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  end the dangerous rhetoric. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=355.48s)]
*  This letter continues, quote, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=357.92s)]
*  We call on Vice President Harris to take these threats seriously, stop escalating the threat [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=359.8s)]
*  environment, help ensure that President Trump has the necessary resources, they've been [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=366.24s)]
*  denied many times, to be protected from those threats. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=371.56s)]
*  But if Kamala needs even more evidence that her vile remarks have crossed the line, well, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=375.76s)]
*  maybe she should listen to an actual survivor of the Holocaust, in this case, a 94-year-old [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=380.64s)]
*  man who was nine years old when taken by the Nazis, whose parents were murdered under Adolf [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=386.8s)]
*  Hitler in Nazi Germany. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Listen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=396.44s)]
*  I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousand lifetimes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=397.44s)]
*  For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler is the worst thing I've ever heard [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=404.8s)]
*  in my 75 years living in the United States. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=414.56s)]
*  What does Kamala Harris have to say for herself? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  What about her supporters? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=424.04s)]
*  By the way, weren't they supposed to be running a joyful campaign? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=425.04s)]
*  Well, tonight, there is good news from all of this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=429.12s)]
*  This election, once again, has exposed the radicalism, extremism, the true colors of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  this modern Democratic Party for all to see. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  They don't care about democracy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=445.18s)]
*  They don't care about the quality of life here in America, or maybe they'd be talking [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=447.88s)]
*  about that every day, or even global peace. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=452.36s)]
*  They want to lecture Israel how to fight the people that are dedicated to their destruction [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=455.72s)]
*  that killed the equivalent of 40,000 Americans in a single day. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=461.8s)]
*  You know, they only care about power, and they'll shred the so-called norms in any [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  way in a heartbeat as they lecture the rest of the country about civility, like they lecture [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=471.52s)]
*  the country about the dangers of fossil fuels while they themselves are flying around the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=477.4s)]
*  world in private jets with a massive carbon footprint. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, they're going to toss out millions of primary votes and install a different candidate. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=485.76s)]
*  Oh, threat to democracy? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=492.56s)]
*  They're going to get rid of the filibuster, pack the courts. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=493.56s)]
*  They'll try to throw their chief political rivals in jail. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=496.64s)]
*  We've watched the weaponization of the DOJ. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=499.67999999999995s)]
*  We've watched lawfare unfold. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0t0foP2M&t=502.0s)]
