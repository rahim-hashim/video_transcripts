# Trump: Howard Stern went ‘woke’
**Fox News:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE)
*  Celebs can't quit Donald Trump. Roll it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=0.0s)]
*  Have you thought about the possibility he might use the power of the federal government against you personally? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have, but I'm just, I'm comforted in the fact that he's coming after you first. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=10.0s)]
*  Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=15.0s)]
*  I will if he does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=18.0s)]
*  I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=20.0s)]
*  I don't think, I do. I'll be honest with you. I have no respect for you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=24.0s)]
*  You could be president. Do you ever think about anything like that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=29.0s)]
*  No. Really? Never? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=32.0s)]
*  No. Why? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=33.0s)]
*  I wouldn't make a good president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=34.0s)]
*  You don't think you'd be good? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=35.0s)]
*  I wouldn't really pass any of the things that you have to pass, but I guess Trump did it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=41.0s)]
*  No? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=42.0s)]
*  You would be a boy scout like a president. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, that didn't age well for either of them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=47.0s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=51.0s)]
*  So, Mr. Trump, the thing that, I think there's a, my theory is that famous people don't like it when their fame is put in proper perspective, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=52.0s)]
*  when it's dwarfed by somebody with more fame. So they prefer to be on the hierarchy of fame. They want to be on top. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=61.0s)]
*  I notice a lot of these guys, that's, it's an emotional response to the fact that you're bigger, more well known. Does that make sense? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, I watch, I know some of them, and like Howard, I was on Howard Stern's show as much as anybody, and he was great at that time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=78.0s)]
*  And then he went woke. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=89.0s)]
*  And since he's gone woke, his ratings have gone down the tubes, and he sort of went anti-Trump for a couple of reasons. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=90.0s)]
*  But I was on his show a lot. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=99.0s)]
*  In fact, he has a best of. Did you ever see the best of? Best of Howard Stern? I don't want to promote it necessarily, but. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=100.0s)]
*  And I was there for just about all of them, the best of. We had good shows, he was good, but he's changed and, you know, he doesn't do the ratings anymore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=107.0s)]
*  No, he doesn't. He doesn't have to. He's almost finished. Kat, do you remember Howard Stern? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=115.0s)]
*  No, but I was, but you're, you've been on every show. You've been on TV a lot. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=119.0s)]
*  A lot of shows. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=124.0s)]
*  I mean, would you rule out, I'm not saying now, but would you ever rule out doing reality TV again? Like, what about hosting Love Island? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=125.0s)]
*  I had the Apprentice for 12 years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=133.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=137.0s)]
*  14 seasons, but 12 years, a lot of time. They wanted to renew me for five years. They were all set to do it, and I didn't want to do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=138.0s)]
*  I wanted to run for, I said I wanted to run for president. Mark Burnett, who's a great guy, and you know, the producer and all, and all of the people from NBC, everybody came up to see me to talk me out of running. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=145.0s)]
*  They said it's not possible to win. Nobody's ever done that. I mean, and nobody ever gives up Primetime show. It was a big hit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=155.0s)]
*  And they wanted to do a five year extension. I said, no, that's actually when I knew I was going to do it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=162.0s)]
*  And I mean, I love doing The Apprentice. It was so successful. The big question is, did it make a difference? Would I have been president? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=166.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of people say they created this guy from The Apprentice. And I don't know if that's true because they chose me because of the, you know, the success. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=175.0s)]
*  I think it was your chemistry with Bret Michaels. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=184.0s)]
*  Bret Michaels was a character. We had great characters. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=187.0s)]
*  And we learned a lot about, I mean, we had Dennis Rodman was great. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=191.0s)]
*  He was fantastic. And we had we had tremendous characters on the show. We had a lot of I mean, everybody was helped basically by being on The Apprentice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=195.0s)]
*  But I just wanted to do it. I saw what was happening with the country. Country was going bad. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=202.0s)]
*  And now what they've done with the border and the wall and the whole thing, I could have built an extra 200 miles. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=207.0s)]
*  I built much more than I said I was going to build. And it worked. I had the Mexican government giving us twenty eight thousand troops. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=213.0s)]
*  We had so many Mexican troops, they had no choice. They had to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=219.0s)]
*  Otherwise, I said, I'm going to put tariffs on your cars that you stole from. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, they stole 32 percent of our car industry. OK, you know, which is not we'll get it back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=225.0s)]
*  Don't worry about it. But, you know, I really felt I wanted to do it because we can make our country the Make America Great Again is such a great mega is such a great tag. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=230.0s)]
*  And I watched Biden where he was very angry at mega. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=242.0s)]
*  He said, we've got to stop mega. And I'm saying it's Make America Great Again. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=246.0s)]
*  Yes, sort of sort of sort of work for. And that's what we're doing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=251.0s)]
*  If you think of it, we have 21. I believe it's 21. They say 16. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=259.0s)]
*  But what difference? I mean, it's a lot of people, more people than any country could sustain. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=264.0s)]
*  Twenty one million people. Many come out of jails and prisons. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=269.0s)]
*  Slight difference between one being a little bit more harsh. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=272.0s)]
*  They come out of mental institutions and insane asylums. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=275.0s)]
*  They come out of terrorist schools. They come literally out of schools, but they're terrorists. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=279.0s)]
*  We have people coming from gangs, the worst gangs in the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=283.0s)]
*  MS-13 considered the meanest gang. They cut people up. They don't want to use guns. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=287.0s)]
*  They attacked two young 16 year old beautiful girls walking to school. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=291.0s)]
*  They cut them up with a knife. They didn't want to shoot him because it wasn't painful. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=295.0s)]
*  They both died. And these people are coming out into our country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=298.0s)]
*  Now you look at what's happening in like Aurora in Colorado, Venezuela, Venezuelan gangs are taking over the real estate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=302.0s)]
*  They're becoming real estate developers and they have. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=311.0s)]
*  Do they get little cards? They have whatever they want. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=314.0s)]
*  You know, like a little real estate card. Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=317.0s)]
*  They have their little card is a bullet. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=320.0s)]
*  Mr. President, can I ask you a question? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=323.0s)]
*  Talking about the border, not just all the young military age men that are coming across this country, the fentanyl that's coming across this country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=325.0s)]
*  If you were in office, would you consider taking importation of fentanyl as a terrorist act? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=332.0s)]
*  Because if you count it under terrorism, then our Department of Defense can get involved and we give our law enforcement a break. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=338.0s)]
*  Correct. Well, and you can even go further than that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=343.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you could send pictures of their mansions to certain generals in Mexico. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=345.0s)]
*  And by the way, these are really these are really rich people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=351.0s)]
*  These are the cartel people. These are really rich. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=355.0s)]
*  Look, we can play games and we can be nice and we can be smart. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=358.0s)]
*  You're never going to I set up blue ribbon committees. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=362.0s)]
*  Friends of my own, could I get on a committee? They didn't know the first thing about it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=365.0s)]
*  They don't know about El Chapo. They don't know about these are very smart, hardened people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=368.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm setting up a blue ribbon committee with socialites from New York and California. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=374.0s)]
*  It's ridiculous. They don't even want to talk about they talk about it for two minutes and they start talking about society. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=379.0s)]
*  The only way you're going to stop this is the death penalty for drug dealers. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=385.0s)]
*  I don't know if this country is ready for it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=389.0s)]
*  But if you think about it, each drug dealer on average kills five hundred people on average. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=391.0s)]
*  He or she drug dealer kills five. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=398.0s)]
*  I know so many families who have lost a son or a daughter or parents even to fentanyl. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=400.0s)]
*  And I had a deal worked out with China with President Xi directly that he was going to give. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=407.0s)]
*  You know, China has the death penalty. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=411.0s)]
*  I said to him, do you have a drug problem? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=413.0s)]
*  When I first met him, he looked at me like, what a stupid question. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=415.0s)]
*  Exactly. He said, no, no, no, no, no drug problem. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=418.0s)]
*  I said, well, what do you do? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=422.0s)]
*  Death penalty, immediate death penalty. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=424.0s)]
*  And I said, that sounds he said without it, I talked to him a lot about he said without it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=427.0s)]
*  You know, China was a drug loaded country years ago. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=432.0s)]
*  Other countries, much smaller, would take it over because they were all wasted, rubbed out with the opium and the poppy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=436.0s)]
*  And they had a big problem. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=443.0s)]
*  But they execute drug dealers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=445.0s)]
*  They have absolutely no drug problem. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=448.0s)]
*  Singapore has no drug problem. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=450.0s)]
*  And it's not nice to talk about. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=452.0s)]
*  But it's the only way you're going to solve the problem. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=454.0s)]
*  You're never going to have. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=455.0s)]
*  Now, we got it down to great numbers, the lowest numbers, but the wall helped. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=456.0s)]
*  A lot of things help. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=461.0s)]
*  But in terms of a drug, getting a drug free country, you can't have that unless you have the death penalty for the dealers. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=462.0s)]
*  All right. We got to take a break. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=471.0s)]
*  Taking it as a maybe on Love Island. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=472.0s)]
*  Up next, media tools think Kamala rules. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeOeIRPuTuE&t=479.0s)]
