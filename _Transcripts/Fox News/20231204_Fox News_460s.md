# Sean Hannity: Republicans will hold Biden’s ‘feet to the fire’
**Fox News:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we are less than 24 hours away from our exclusive town hall with former President [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=7.92s)]
*  Donald J. Trump in Davenport, Iowa. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=13.32s)]
*  By the way, if you'd like to join us or attend, you can sign up on Hannity.com. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=15.48s)]
*  It is for free. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Tickets are free. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=21.28s)]
*  Anyway, in poll after poll, as of now, President Trump is now beating Joe Biden in a hypothetical [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=22.28s)]
*  rematch by a pretty significant margin at this point. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=28.34s)]
*  Many polls showing it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=31.58s)]
*  One key reason for the numbers, while Trump's actually willing and able to participate in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=32.9s)]
*  a real town hall and passionately answer important questions of our time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=37.9s)]
*  Biden, meanwhile, he can barely answer two or three preselected questions without imploding. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=43.26s)]
*  Now, sadly, the president's mental condition is likely going to get worse, not better. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  As it stands now, Joe is not doing well over the weekend. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  He looked really, really bad yet again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=58.22s)]
*  Despite a very light workload, the president still managed to struggle mightily. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=65.86s)]
*  The brothers bound made it all seem effortless and almost magical. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=66.86s)]
*  They described it as, quote, we'll be walking down the street together and we'll simultaneously [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  begin to sing the same song in the same key. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=76.74s)]
*  God love you, Billy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=80.1s)]
*  I tell you, that's incredible. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=81.1s)]
*  Before I travel from the Bronx to change the... [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=82.86s)]
*  And by the way, with other movies and movies she's earned, a Golden Globe and a Primetime [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=85.58s)]
*  Enemy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=91.26s)]
*  Enemy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=92.26s)]
*  That's me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=95.26s)]
*  Primetime Emmy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=97.26s)]
*  And after his march, Joe had trouble yet again attempting to step away from a podium. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  He looked dazed and confused, shuffled his feet until his wife was able to coax him in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=103.9s)]
*  the right direction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=108.62s)]
*  Somebody needs to help him, just like at the tomb of the, you know, unknown soldier. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=110.38000000000001s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=114.62s)]
*  Biden's only going to get worse from here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=115.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, yeah, it tends to get worse and worse when you have cognitive decline. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=117.86s)]
*  It is degenerative. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, his reelection bid defies all logic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  I cannot think of a public appearance that your president has made now in months where [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  he's not mumbling, stumbling, bumbling in his speech and or dazed and confused about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  where to go and what to do next. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=137.5s)]
*  And tonight, whether Biden realizes it or not, he has a huge problem on the horizon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  As a matter of fact, many problems. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  Fox News has confirmed House Republican leaders they will most likely push forward with a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=146.58s)]
*  vote to initiate an impeachment inquiry next week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, this after Biden has once again been caught in a lie, you might recall. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=159.34s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, how many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=160.34s)]
*  business dealings? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=166.34s)]
*  I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=168.94s)]
*  their businesses, period. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=177.26s)]
*  There will be an absolute wall between personal and private and the government. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=181.5s)]
*  Do you stand by your statement that you did not discuss any of your son's overseas business [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  dealings? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=191.98s)]
*  Yes, I stand by that statement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=192.98s)]
*  Now, according to newly unearthed bank records subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  Chairman James Comer, not only did Joe Biden discuss his son's business ventures, but [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=198.14s)]
*  he also received direct payments from one of Hunter's corporations. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, Hunter Biden's attorneys claim, while their client was merely paying his father [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  back for a truck that Hunter financed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=212.14s)]
*  But keep in mind that these 2018 payments were not made from Hunter's personal account. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=214.82s)]
*  Instead, one of Hunter's many LLCs deposited the money into Joe's account, an account [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=220.82s)]
*  used to conduct business in China. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=226.38s)]
*  So why did Hunter pay his father from a business account? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=229.26s)]
*  And why did Joe lie about ever discussing business, foreign business deals with his [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=233.26s)]
*  son, his brother or anybody for that matter? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=238.06s)]
*  Now last month, Comer revealed two very unusual checks to Joe Biden from his brother, also [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=240.78s)]
*  purporting to be loan repayments. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, we've also long reported texts and emails from Hunter complaining about having [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=248.98s)]
*  to fork over half his income to Pops. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=253.46s)]
*  Another email from Hunter's business partner discussing setting aside 10 percent for the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=255.94s)]
*  big guy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=260.7s)]
*  Well, Tony Bobulinski told us who the big guy was. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=261.7s)]
*  Another document revealing that Joe Biden used his son's Wells Fargo account to pay [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=264.7s)]
*  bills. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=269.42s)]
*  And of course, there are photographs and text messages and emails and eyewitness accounts [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=270.42s)]
*  detailing when Vice President Biden had his meetings, his phone calls, his letters and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=275.9s)]
*  even dinners, Cafe Milano with Hunter's foreign partners. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=281.06s)]
*  Now, these are not business leaders or Wall Street executives. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=285.02s)]
*  Instead, Hunter and other Biden family members, they were raking in massive amounts of money, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=288.78s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars from sketchy oligarchs, well-connected foreign nationals and some [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=294.62s)]
*  of our country's biggest geopolitical foes like Russia, oh, China, Ukraine, Romania, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=301.9s)]
*  Kazakhstan, you name it, and other countries. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  Hunter Biden, who admittedly at the time was struggling with addiction, had no relevant [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  experience at all with finance or in the gas, coal and energy industry. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  Getting paid millions for what? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=322.7s)]
*  Now, that's the 20 plus million dollar question, isn't it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=324.38s)]
*  As Hunter's former business partner Devin Archer stated, they were buying access to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=327.9s)]
*  the Biden brand and possible influence over U.S. policy that could, well, could some maybe [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  think about calling that potentially, maybe needs to be investigated as bribery? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=338.9s)]
*  Let's look at Article 2, Section 4 of our Constitution. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=345.5s)]
*  The president, the vice president and all civil officers of the United States shall [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=348.7s)]
*  be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery and other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  high crimes and misdemeanors. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=360.94s)]
*  Now, here's just one example of what we're talking about. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=362.61999999999995s)]
*  According to a U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  2014, when Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden received a 3.5 million dollar wire transfer [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  from a woman, former first lady of Moscow, Elena Batarina. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  She's also a Russian oligarch. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=382.86s)]
*  Her husband, yeah, was the mayor of Moscow. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=384.94s)]
*  Batarina was known as, you know, the first lady of Moscow. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=387.26s)]
*  By the way, she wasn't sanctioned with many other Russian oligarchs after the invasion [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=391.1s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=395.1s)]
*  I'm sure just a coincidence. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  And was one of the wealthiest people in Russia, deep ties to Vladimir Putin himself, and yet [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=397.74s)]
*  following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the first lady of Moscow was one of the few oligarchs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=403.1s)]
*  not targeted by Joe Biden's sanctions. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=409.34000000000003s)]
*  This reeks of corruption. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=411.74s)]
*  Remember, Congress has a sworn duty to uphold the U.S. Constitution and check the executive [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=413.66s)]
*  branch. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=419.98s)]
*  And now there is more than enough evidence for a trial for once in his life. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=420.7s)]
*  Joe Biden has got to be held accountable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=425.58s)]
*  If Democrats truly believe that foreign interference is a serious threat, like they've [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=428.06s)]
*  been lecturing us over and over again, that Russia collusion is a clear and present danger, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  then they will join with Republicans. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=437.98s)]
*  They will hold Biden's feet to the fire. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=439.66s)]
*  Otherwise, all of their righteous indignation has been nothing but, well, frankly, show. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xxAIsYLDFM&t=441.98s)]
