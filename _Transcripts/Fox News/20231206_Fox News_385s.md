# Ted Cruz: This is a sad situation
**Fox News:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk)
*  All right, we head over to the Senate side of the Capitol complex where just yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=0.0s)]
*  FBI Director Chris Wray, he was grilled over how the FBI has been politicized and the DOJ [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=3.72s)]
*  weaponized and his bureau weaponized. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=10.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=12.76s)]
*  I think the Department of Justice has been profoundly politicized under Attorney General [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=13.76s)]
*  Merrick Garland. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  And I think the FBI has as well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think you've been unwilling to stand up to senior career officials in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=23.44s)]
*  the FBI who's allowed the FBI to be politicized. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  I have a responsibility to the FBI not to allow it to be a partisan tool and a partisan [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=32.84s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=42.16s)]
*  The testimony, and by the way, the FBI has done nothing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=43.16s)]
*  And I have not and I will not. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Have you opened an investigation into whether the Attorney General lied under oath to Congress [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=48.08s)]
*  and whether the Attorney General obstructed justice? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=52.0s)]
*  I'm not going to go down that road here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=54.6s)]
*  I know you're not. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=56.52s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=57.84s)]
*  Nobody thinks you've opened an investigation because you're not willing to. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=58.84s)]
*  All right, joining us now with more Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=62.72s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=67.0s)]
*  Just to dovetail off our last segment, you asked Ray, you know, he wouldn't answer your [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=70.0s)]
*  question if the FBI tried to ascertain Joe and Hunter Biden's location when that WhatsApp [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=76.04s)]
*  message that I read in my opening monologue was sent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  Also, you rip Ray for not answering questions about the Hunter investigation and you ripped [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=86.56s)]
*  him for how the bureau has been politicized and weaponized. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  What is your take? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=96.28s)]
*  Is this FBI director involved in a cover up for the Bidens? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=97.76s)]
*  Is this a dual justice system? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=100.92s)]
*  I thought Lady Justice was to be blind. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think she's blind, deaf and crippled right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  And I think it is a sad situation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  This Department of Justice, this FBI is the most political, it is the most partisan, it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=113.12s)]
*  is the most weaponized we've ever seen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=118.56s)]
*  As you noted in your opening monologue, you played that WhatsApp where Hunter says, I'm [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=121.24s)]
*  sitting next to my father and he threatens a Chinese communist with retribution from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=124.88s)]
*  daddy unless he sends millions of dollars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=130.28s)]
*  Now, Gary Shapley, one of the two IRS whistleblowers said the investigators had a very obvious [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=132.48s)]
*  way to check it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=137.88s)]
*  One of the GPS data was Hunter sitting next to Joe Biden. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=139.4s)]
*  You both of them have phones. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=143.16s)]
*  You can ascertain where they were the instant that text message was sent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Gary Shapley said the Biden DOJ blocked that investigation, said you're not allowed to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  get Hunter or Joe Biden's GPS data. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=154.4s)]
*  You're not allowed to inquire. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=157.48s)]
*  No questions about the big guy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=159.2s)]
*  So I asked Chris Ray, did the FBI try to get the GPS data to determine whether this was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=160.88s)]
*  in fact a bribery shakedown? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=167.72s)]
*  Chris Ray's answer was, well, I'm not going to talk to you about an open investigation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=170.6s)]
*  It's the biggest lie. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=174.0s)]
*  It's the biggest shell game. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=175.2s)]
*  They claim it's an open investigation, but they're not investigating anything. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  They refuse to investigate anything. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  And when there's accountability, look, we've got major whistleblowers saying the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  attorney general has committed multiple felonies and the attorney general stonewalls, the FBI [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  stonewalls. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=192.2s)]
*  And Chris Ray's answers yesterday were disgraceful. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=193.2s)]
*  He believes he owes no accountability to Congress and no accountability to the American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=196.64s)]
*  people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=201.48s)]
*  And one of the things I shared with him is I travel the country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=202.48s)]
*  I am regularly approached by FBI agents who are horrified by what's happening in their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=205.76s)]
*  agency. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  They're honorable men and women. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  They want to, they want to defend the rule of law. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  They want to catch bad guys. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=215.92s)]
*  And instead the political leadership at DOJ is turning them into a cover up patrol for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=217.72s)]
*  the Biden White House. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to get your reaction, Senator, if I can. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=225.48s)]
*  And these comments by Christopher Ray talking about how he's never seen the terror threat [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=228.44s)]
*  on every level as bad as it is now saying, you know, blinking lights are everywhere. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=238.56s)]
*  Now this, why has he been, why has his silence been deafening when it came to Joe Biden's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=244.64s)]
*  8 plus million illegal immigrants? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=251.84s)]
*  And now we know where they're coming from. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=255.48s)]
*  Iran, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, China, Russia, tens and tens of thousands. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=257.72s)]
*  Can you, did you ever get an answer out of him? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=265.08s)]
*  Now he's finally warning us after all these people are here unvetted that the terror threat [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  has never been greater in history? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=272.6s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  To me that's a dereliction of duty. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=276.36s)]
*  I know he was busy looking at, you know, into moms and dads at school board meetings and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=278.24s)]
*  going after pro-life protesters, people that were doing it peacefully. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=283.12s)]
*  And I know he was, you know, really looking hard at that Hunter Biden laptop and warning [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=287.8s)]
*  Big Tech. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  Why hasn't he been dealing with that threat issue? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=293.12s)]
*  Listen, the FBI has stonewalled on these questions for a very long time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=295.44s)]
*  And it was, you know, about a year ago that Chris Ray was going before Congress saying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=299.92s)]
*  the biggest threat we have is crazy white nationalists. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=303.52s)]
*  Come on, it's not like there's a surge of Nazis running around. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=307.92s)]
*  They're idiots and bigots. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=311.24s)]
*  But you want to know what the biggest threat is? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=313.0s)]
*  It's Hamas terrorists and Hezbollah terrorists coming across our southern border seeking [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=315.12s)]
*  to carry out a terror attack. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  And I got to tell you, when I was down at the border just a few weeks ago, our border [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=321.86s)]
*  patrol agents are very worried about it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=325.04s)]
*  We've got a war in Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=327.64s)]
*  And when I see Chris Ray finally, the FBI finally acknowledging that terror threat, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=329.88s)]
*  what that tells me, Sean, is they are seeing so much evidence. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=335.48s)]
*  I think we're at a greater risk for a major terror attack now than we've been any time [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  since September 11th. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=344.0s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I did a classified briefing today from the administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  The number of special interest aliens from dangerous terrorist countries has skyrocketed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=349.62s)]
*  under Joe Biden and they still refuse to secure the border. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  And if anything happens to any American, he will have blood on his hands. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=358.8s)]
*  We have been warning and warning. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=363.32s)]
*  Yes, that is absolutely right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=364.32s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=365.32s)]
*  Your book, by the way, will put it up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=366.32s)]
*  It is called, Unwoke, How to Defeat Cultural Marxism in America. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=367.76s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz, thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAgKuk9vtk&t=371.36s)]
