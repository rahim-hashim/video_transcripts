# Martha MacCallum to Kayleigh McEnany: Biden's candidacy got 'even more interesting'
**Fox News:** [July 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU)
*  Here now to kick off our night of reaction to this historic interview is the anchor and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=0.0s)]
*  executive editor of the story right here on Fox News, Martha McCallum. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=4.16s)]
*  Martha, the reactions pouring in, Katie Rogers at The New York Times saying that those in Biden's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=8.32s)]
*  circle who watch this think it's enough to keep him in the fight for now. NBC reporting a little [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=14.0s)]
*  differently from a House Democrat. It made me sad, the House Democrat said, completely out of touch [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=19.92s)]
*  with reality insulated from the truth. I'll be breaking my silence soon. Your thoughts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=24.96s)]
*  I thought it was fascinating, Kayleigh. It's great to be on with you tonight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  You know, that first soundbite that you played, when I listened to it again, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=35.52s)]
*  I tried again to put together the train of thought of what he was talking about. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=39.68s)]
*  He said, I prepared like I do for foreign leaders. Then he went into a section on what the polls are. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And then he finished by saying that former President Trump had lied a lot. So, I mean, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=49.6s)]
*  I would have really liked for George Stephanopoulos to have said in that moment, I'm sorry, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=55.28s)]
*  what did you mean by that? Which one of those points was what you were trying to say? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=59.84s)]
*  And just asked him that rather than all of these repeated questions about will you take a cognitive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  test, which he said no to. And I think that's a very valid question that he asked because I think [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=71.12s)]
*  that's what American voters are going to be asking because this campaign day after day and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=75.92s)]
*  with every appearance is going to become a cumulative test of this president. And we've [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=81.12s)]
*  seen already so many instances of these blunders and lost vacant stairs. So this is going to go on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=87.76s)]
*  and on. That's what he made clear, Kayleigh. And I just want to make one point here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=94.72s)]
*  What I heard from Joe Biden, I am stubborn. I am not going anywhere. I don't believe the polls. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=98.56s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, if they came to me and asked me to get out, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=104.48s)]
*  cannot get me out. In fact, only God can get me to leave this race. He said that twice. So he has [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=108.48s)]
*  set up a Biden versus many strong members of his party battle. And he's putting his line in the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=116.48s)]
*  sand and he says, I'm only talking to a couple of people. I'm believing what they're telling me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not going anywhere. So I think tonight this got even more interesting, actually, Kayleigh. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Indeed it did. I mean, you have Senator Mark Warner, a huge Democratic Biden ally, putting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=135.28s)]
*  together this meeting on Monday, according to the reports. And I wonder how some of the, I guess, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=140.48s)]
*  factually inaccurate moments is how I would describe them, how they'll factor into their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  calculus. Here's one of them. This is President Biden on NATO. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=150.16s)]
*  Can you serve effectively for the next four years? George, I'm the guy that put NATO together, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=154.72s)]
*  the future. No one thought I could expand it. I'm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=161.12s)]
*  could happen. I'm the guy that put together the South Pacific Initiative with AUKUS. I'm the guy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=166.72s)]
*  that got 50 nations, not only in Europe, outside of Europe as well, to help Ukraine. I'm the guy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=173.84s)]
*  that got Japanese to expand their budget. Martha, the issue is Putin was not stopped. He invaded a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  country and NATO, he did not create NATO. NATO was created in 1949, President Truman. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=188.48s)]
*  Again, Kayleigh, I think it's a great sound bite to play. I would have liked to have heard George [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=196.16s)]
*  Stephanopoulos follow up. I'm sorry, you shut Putin down. Putin has not been shut down and there [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=202.16s)]
*  wouldn't have been a need or a scramble for Finland and Sweden to join NATO if Ukraine hadn't been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=209.44s)]
*  invaded by Russia after this president, and this is just the fact of the matter, said that a minor [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=216.32s)]
*  incursion might be okay, but something larger than that wasn't going to be okay. So all the things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=222.48s)]
*  that he just laid out happened on his watch and were perpetuated by the allowance of Putin feeling [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=226.88s)]
*  that he had the freedom to go into Ukraine in the first place. He also said, we're sort of checkmating [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=234.4s)]
*  China at this point, and I would have loved to have heard more about what he means by that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=239.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there was this talk in Axios today of inevitability, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=246.4s)]
*  and these Democrats, most of them anonymously, Martha, saying, you know, it's almost inevitable [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  that he steps down. This Axios interview isn't—or, excuse me, this ABC interview isn't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=256.08s)]
*  enough. Some people wanted an hour-long interview, but it's very clear upon watching this, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=261.36s)]
*  20-minute interview that an hour interview would have been untenable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, I mean, this battle is going to continue, and I think it's fascinating. You know, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=271.28s)]
*  it felt very quick to me. It was 22 minutes, and it's not unusual for presidents to say, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=277.04s)]
*  look, we're going to give you 15 or 20 minutes. But it felt as—it feels as though he is so [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=281.12s)]
*  committed. You know, I thought—one of the—here's one of the things that really struck me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=287.84s)]
*  He basically said, I'm in this until the bitter end, and if I lose, I don't—it's a very [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=292.32s)]
*  bitter end, and if I lose, I don't—it's okay as long as I give it my all. And I thought [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=298.4s)]
*  that was also a very interesting moment, because you've got Democrats and donors across the country [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=304.64s)]
*  who are panicking and scrambling because they think he might lose to Donald Trump. He says he [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  doesn't believe any of the polls that show that, but he says, as long as I give it my all, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=312.88s)]
*  that's my measure for staying in there. And he has all the delegates. He's got a lot of the cards [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=318.4s)]
*  in his own deck, Kayleigh, so it's anybody's guess as to whether or not they'll be successful. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=323.28s)]
*  He says only God can push him out. We'll see. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=328.8s)]
*  Yeah, and as Susan Glaser said, there's a lot of people calling into the White House switchboard [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  saying, hey, the Lord Almighty here. We need to talk to you. Martha, thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=336.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZz0qmTWlU&t=353.2s)]
