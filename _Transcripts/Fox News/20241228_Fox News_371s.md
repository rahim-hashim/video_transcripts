# Property is a key to liberty, panelist says
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity, President Biden's latest broken promise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  There are so many. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Maybe his worst yet. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Remember when he promised to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=8.24s)]
*  Together, we build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=13.36s)]
*  My vision has always been—and I mean it sincerely since I was a young senator—to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=20.16s)]
*  grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=24.44s)]
*  I came to office determined to uphold the duty to care and get us through one of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=29.96s)]
*  toughest periods in our nation's history. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=33.84s)]
*  And we have. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=36.4s)]
*  Building a future of American possibilities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=37.4s)]
*  Building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not just the top down. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=40.76s)]
*  When the middle grows, the bottom has a chance, the poor have an opportunity, and the wealthy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=45.16s)]
*  still do very well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=50.16s)]
*  Well, what an embarrassment for this nation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=51.64s)]
*  Well, Joe is leaving office. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  And this year, the United States saw an 18 percent rise in homelessness. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=56.76s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=62.04s)]
*  The amount of first-time homebuyers has hit a record low under Biden, as the rising cost [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=63.4s)]
*  of living, especially housing, continues to hurt Americans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=69.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, the wealthy are dominating the housing market, with all cash purchases rising [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=79.24s)]
*  And if you still believe Biden's bogus promise, the state of California, which most closely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=81.48s)]
*  resembles the president's policies, has the highest child poverty rate in the nation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=86.16s)]
*  Here now with reaction, podcast host Kira Davis and Fox News contributor DeRoy Murdoch. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=93.08s)]
*  Kira, a lot of your work has been about kids and advocating for children as a parent, and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=99.0s)]
*  the nature of knowing what's happening in California is one thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=105.16s)]
*  But they continue to claim that what they're doing is best, and yet how does that translate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=109.04s)]
*  into the highest poverty, the child poverty rate in the country? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=115.12s)]
*  Well, happy new year to you, Tammy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=119.16s)]
*  It's really good to be here with you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=121.52s)]
*  I want to point out the obvious here, especially here in California. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=123.64s)]
*  We're a border state. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=127.92s)]
*  So we're talking about issues of child poverty, feeding children, making sure that all of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=129.44s)]
*  our neighbors are cared for. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=134.38s)]
*  But if we don't talk about the root problem, these are all useless discussions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=136.84s)]
*  California is a border state. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=139.56s)]
*  We're not going to solve childhood poverty until we close the border, until we solve [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=141.28s)]
*  rising crime. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But I want to look at something larger here, Tammy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=147.48s)]
*  You're talking about homeownership. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=149.84s)]
*  You're talking about the American dream. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=151.48s)]
*  And the American dream is to own property. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=154.16s)]
*  Owning property is a huge leg of the stool that holds up liberty. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  And it is really the most revolutionary part of our revolution. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  And American liberty is a real thorn in the side of a world that is addicted to bondage. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=167.52s)]
*  And property is a key to that liberty. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's a mistake that you are seeing individual property ownership be depressed, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  even as we deal with things like childhood poverty and homelessness across all the spectrum. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=182.72s)]
*  It feels like a concerted effort. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=189.52s)]
*  We've been the frogs boiling in the water for all this time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=191.16s)]
*  So hopefully we're about to turn the page on that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=194.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's like every piece leads into the other part of the problem. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=196.48s)]
*  Like it all feeds into each other. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=202.16s)]
*  And Darroi, Kira's great points about liberty, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=204.8s)]
*  You're not really free if you're reliant on the government, if you don't have that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=208.28s)]
*  freedom of property, which is the key. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=212.28s)]
*  And yet, you know, people are using apparently all cash to buy homes because they've got [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=216.04s)]
*  the money to do so, because they want to avoid the high mortgage rates by just buying them [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  outright, leaving behind everyone else who might need to take out a loan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=227.32s)]
*  And so the inventory goes down. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=231.7s)]
*  This seems to be something that's got to be at the core of what we do to make America [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  great again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right about that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=241.0s)]
*  You know, we have a number of compounding problems. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=243.6s)]
*  One is Biden inflation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=245.92s)]
*  You know, we've seen prices go up for gasoline, for food, for you name it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=246.92s)]
*  Also true in housing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=250.16s)]
*  The average home cost around $270,000 five years ago. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=251.16s)]
*  Now it's about $405,000. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=254.76s)]
*  That's up 50 percent. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=255.76s)]
*  At the same time, interest rates have gone up from around 3.7 to about 6.5, 7 percent [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=256.76s)]
*  now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=262.2s)]
*  And so it's become more expensive to try to get a 30-year loan. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=263.2s)]
*  And because it's so high, a lot of people who have the lower loans don't want to leave [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=266.84s)]
*  and get another house because they're paying a decent rate now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=269.88s)]
*  So why leave? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=273.18s)]
*  And therefore that ties up the inventory. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=274.18s)]
*  There are fewer houses available. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  That keeps prices high. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=277.82s)]
*  And on and on it goes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=279.26s)]
*  So as you say, it's just one problem feeding into another problem and another problem. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=280.42s)]
*  And it leads to an even tougher ability for people to achieve that part of the American [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=284.02s)]
*  dream as hard as they might try to do so. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=289.18s)]
*  You know, and Kerik goes back into this when we think about general inflation, right, his [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=291.58s)]
*  whole economic idea. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=295.38s)]
*  But everybody gets strapped because of the cost of energy, gasoline, rent, beyond owning [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=297.38s)]
*  a home and food. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=303.62s)]
*  So you're trying to keep up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=306.24s)]
*  And then his energy policies continue to bury all of us because that leads into more inflation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=308.36s)]
*  It's shrinking. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=316.72s)]
*  This is a shrinking of the American dream. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=317.72s)]
*  And it's been absolutely deliberate. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=319.44s)]
*  All of these things are deliberate, reducing our dependence on ourselves for energy, reducing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=321.3s)]
*  the opportunity to own homes, reducing education levels. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=327.58s)]
*  We've been having this visa debate today. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=332.06s)]
*  All of this goes together. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=334.62s)]
*  We have been under duress for the last four years, as has the American dream been. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=336.42s)]
*  America is not just a country of law and order. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=342.38s)]
*  America is an idea. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=345.98s)]
*  And our idea has been under duress for these years, these past four years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=347.58s)]
*  So hopefully we're turning the page. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=351.9s)]
*  It's going to be changing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=353.82s)]
*  I think very dramatically. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=354.82s)]
*  So Kira, DeRoy, great job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=356.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=358.06s)]
*  And Merry Christmas. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMIWiCceJ4&t=359.06s)]
