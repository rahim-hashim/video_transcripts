# Trump reacts to Biden's mental ability: 'He doesn't have a clue'
**Fox News:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I)
*  Welcome back to Hannity. We are broadcasting live tonight from Shelby Park in Eagle Pass. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=0.0s)]
*  We are in the state of Texas, the free state of Texas, still with us for an exclusive interview [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=5.44s)]
*  is former President Donald J. Trump. We've talked a lot about the border, the number [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=9.96s)]
*  one issue. Let me move on to some other issues. Probably more than anybody else, I picked [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  up that Joe Biden, this is before the 2020 election, is weak and frail and a cognitive [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=19.8s)]
*  mess. And I would say in the last three plus years, he has deteriorated greatly. I want [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  to play a montage of the president. Take a look. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=32.76s)]
*  I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit, not say what I'm really thinking. There's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=42.56s)]
*  some movement. There's been a response from the there's been a response from the opposition. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=47.84s)]
*  But yes, I'm sorry. From Hamas. I think that, as you know, initially, the president of Mexico [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=62.84s)]
*  did not want to open up the gate. When I said when I pushed all these programs, I said [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=77.64s)]
*  I'm going to be president of everybody with living in a red state or green state, red [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=83.44s)]
*  state, green state and president of Mexico. I would be Egypt the last time I checked. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=86.84s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your reaction to that? Eighty six percent of the American people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=92.44s)]
*  believe he is too old to take on what is the hardest job in the world. Well, I hate to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=98.76s)]
*  hear when I when they use the word old because I don't believe it's old. I know people that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=105.48s)]
*  are eighty seven, eighty eight. I know people that are 90 in the 90s, 99. I mean, Bernie [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=109.4s)]
*  Marcus, as an example, there is 95. There are people that are just as sharp. It seems [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=114.56s)]
*  to me just as sharp as they ever were. There's something I guess wrong. I don't want to. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=120.68s)]
*  You know, I feel I'm at a conflict when you ask me that question because we're opponents [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  It's a tough question to answer. It's easy to answer, but I don't like doing it. He's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=130.68s)]
*  got some difficulty, but it's not the age because I know a lot of people that are much [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=137.08s)]
*  older than him that are 100 percent sharp. And I think most people agree with that. I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  don't believe he'd be capable of sitting down to do an interview like this. It'd be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=145.36s)]
*  implying I debated Gavin Newsom. I said your problem is the guy that you are bragging about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=149.12s)]
*  could not have this exchange. He could not do this interview. He couldn't do an interview [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=154.16s)]
*  where you ask even a few questions. And I said this morning, I say it loud and clear, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=158.64s)]
*  you should take a cognitive test. A president should take a cognitive. Now, they say that's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=163.55999999999997s)]
*  unconstitutional. For whatever reason, it's unconstitutional. But I took two of them and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=167.32s)]
*  I aced both of them, I'm very proud to say, meaning I got it all right. And they're not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=173.92s)]
*  that they're not Ronnie Jackson did one. They're not that easy. You know, they they show you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  the first ones are pretty easy. And then you get up, you get into the middle category, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=182.04s)]
*  then you get to the end questions. And very few people could answer those questions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=185.88s)]
*  They're very they're actually very tough. I've seen the test. But but I think it's important [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=189.0s)]
*  that there be some form. We have this man negotiating nuclear weapons with Putin and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=193.16s)]
*  with President Xi. And he has no idea what's going on. And he can't find his way off a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=198.96s)]
*  platform when he's speaking. You have five stairs and he ends up walking into a wall. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=204.44s)]
*  And whenever I imitate him, they say Trump had a hard time getting off a platform. I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=209.44s)]
*  said, Well, I'll do things out of sarcasm because I love sarcasm. But politically, it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=213.84s)]
*  never works because they always turn it around. But I'll tell you what, it's not an age thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=217.96s)]
*  But something's going on. And we can't take a chance. This is the most dangerous time [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=225.34s)]
*  in the history of war. We have an incompetent president. Now, I used to treat him and you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=229.86s)]
*  know that I called you. I said you should take it easy on him. I used to call you a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=234.4s)]
*  true story. He thought I was being too hard on him and I was making too light of it. He [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=238.28000000000003s)]
*  told me when I got indicted because nobody thought that was going to happen, including [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=242.92s)]
*  the fake news on the left. They said they'll never be indicted. Like on the January 6th, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  they went right up until the end. They'll never be indicted. You can't indict him on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=252.16s)]
*  that. I made the beautiful speech that was actually a very nice speech. I said wonderful [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=255.64s)]
*  things on then Twitter, now truth, because truth is better than anything in my opinion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=261.24s)]
*  But everybody has to go on truth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=266.36s)]
*  Did I read that you might make $4 billion? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=268.2s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to make. I mean, I own something that became very valuable. Truth [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=270.8s)]
*  has really become sort of the voice of America, the real voice of America. And it's what I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=273.88s)]
*  use exclusively and it's doing great. But when you take a look at all of the things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=278.52s)]
*  that are going on in this world now, we need a man who's super competent. We need a man [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=283.0s)]
*  that can do it. He doesn't have a clue. He's when they indicted me, I said now I can go [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=288.44s)]
*  after him because this is what he did. And he indicted me four times. You could take [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=294.0s)]
*  the worst criminals in the world. They haven't been indicted four times. And I got indicted [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=298.24s)]
*  over nonsense over pure nonsense that the radical left said there's no way he's going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  to be like the thing in Manhattan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=307.12s)]
*  And why didn't they do it years ago? They should have done this years ago. They shouldn't [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=310.56s)]
*  have done it now right in the middle of an election. I don't even think if you look at [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=313.56s)]
*  DOJ, the regulation rules and regulation, they don't even have the right to be doing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=316.72s)]
*  it now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=321.0s)]
*  But they did it to interfere with the election. And when he did that, I said, now I can say [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=322.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is the most incompetent president we've ever had. He's the worst president we've [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  ever had. He is a true threat to democracy because he's weaponized the FBI and the DOJ [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  to go get his political opponent and many other people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=337.44s)]
*  The Christians, he's really after the Catholics. I don't know what's going on with the Catholics, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  but for some reason there's something happening with the Catholics. I mean, I don't know how [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=344.64s)]
*  they can possibly vote for a Democrat or for him, but he's weaponized government at a level [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  that nobody's ever seen before outside of a third world country. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you, you actually told something to me, said something to me before we came [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=356.56s)]
*  on the air today because the left tries to say, oh, he's going to be seeking revenge [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=361.56s)]
*  and using the Justice Department. I've talked at length at how you want to talk about the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=366.56s)]
*  weaponization of justice. It is happening now in this country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=370.88s)]
*  That's a real threat. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is a real threat. And you gave a very interesting answer about the issue that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  oh, he would seek revenge. Recall what you just said to me? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  I use this and I tell people this. My revenge is going to be success. We're going to make [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=387.0s)]
*  this country so successful. We're going to do it rapidly. We're going to bring energy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  way down. We're going to bring inflation way down. We're going to get prices down. You [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  look at the cost of food. You look at the cost of rent. You look at the cost of some [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=399.4s)]
*  of these things. It's just, you know, really disables our country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=402.96s)]
*  You said, I'd never do to them what they've done to me. That you, I'll let you pick it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=407.12s)]
*  I will be tough and I will be fair and I will be seeking to make America great again. You [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=412.6s)]
*  know, it's an expression that we came up with. I think it's probably the greatest in the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=418.6s)]
*  history of this country, maybe in the history of the world. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=423.24s)]
*  MAGA, make America great again. And when I see him, we will stop MAGA. I said, does he [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=425.72s)]
*  have any idea what MAGA means? It means make America great again. He wants to stop MAGA. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=430.88s)]
*  I want to make America great again. Our country's in big trouble right now. Look at what we're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  looking at right now. We're looking at walls and fences. You know, with me, they knew they [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=439.66s)]
*  weren't going to be invited in. They weren't. Lots of things weren't going to be happening. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  They're inviting millions of people into our country. And the saddest part is a lot of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=448.5s)]
*  the people that are being invited in, you don't want in your country. They're very dangerous [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=453.14000000000004s)]
*  people. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=456.66s)]
*  Let me ask you this. You put out on truth a statement when the Alabama court came back [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=457.38s)]
*  with the issue of in vitro fertilization, IVF. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=463.54s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=465.98s)]
*  I would argue that 2022, a lot of people thought overturning Roe v. Wade would end up being [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=466.66s)]
*  a good thing. We know what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to demagogue [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=472.06s)]
*  Republicans like they always do. They're racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, all that stuff. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=477.22s)]
*  But more democracy and peril. They hate Donald Trump. January 6th. But then the issue of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=482.5s)]
*  abortion, I think it played a very big part. They demagogue that issue in 2022, in the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=488.54s)]
*  midterm. I think it hurt Republicans. You took a strong stand on IVF. Where are you [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=495.54s)]
*  on that? And what is your message to other candidates? And where are you on abortion? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  So I saw the IVF and a judge in Alabama made a very harsh decision. It was very, very tough. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  And I came out immediately and I said, we want to help women. This is fertilization. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=512.02s)]
*  This is they're having a hard time having a baby, to put it very simply. And they're [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=516.82s)]
*  helped by clinics and others. And all of a sudden it was stopped in Alabama. And I put [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=521.0200000000001s)]
*  out a very strong statement that we're totally in favor of it. I got a call from Katie Britt, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=525.46s)]
*  a very wonderful young senator in Alabama. And she said, friends of mine were coming [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=530.22s)]
*  up and like almost attacking her. They were so upset about it. And I said, what's the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=535.1s)]
*  issue? What does it explain? What is it exactly? Are we talking about the IVF? And I said, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  we want that. We want people to help. We're on the side of women. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  And same thing on the abortion issue. The abortion issue. Now, I'm for the exceptions [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=549.68s)]
*  like Ronald Reagan was for the exceptions. And I think it's very important. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=554.12s)]
*  Rape that says mother's life. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  Correct. Life of the mother. I think it's a very important thing, the exceptions. I [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=558.8s)]
*  also think that they are the radicals because they will kill the baby in eight months, nine [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=563.8s)]
*  months under Roe v. Wade. They had the right to kill the baby after birth. I mean, literally [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  after birth in some cases. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=575.02s)]
*  Well, that was the governor of Virginia. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  I was talking to your friend, Gavin Newsom. I asked him four times in a row. I said, are [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  there any any limitations at all? He would not answer. A lot of Democrats said that that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  no government officials should ever get between a doctor and her patient. OK, that means no [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=591.76s)]
*  exceptions. But Dobbs said 15 weeks. Right. That's just about a little over first trimester. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=598.12s)]
*  So more and more I'm hearing about 15 weeks and I haven't decided yet. Also, we got it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=606.52s)]
*  back to the states where it belongs. And by the way, a lot of states are taking very strong [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=612.4s)]
*  stances. Ohio voted 15 states. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=616.36s)]
*  15 weeks. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=618.4s)]
*  I mean, a lot of states are taking very strong stances. You look at Kansas, Ohio, and it's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=619.4s)]
*  going to be the law within the state. And they have gone, you know, much different than [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=625.24s)]
*  a lot of people thought. But everybody on both sides said it has to be in the states. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=630.48s)]
*  We did a very good thing, a very big thing, a very important thing. Probably hurt the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=635.28s)]
*  Republicans because a lot of Republicans really didn't know how to talk about it. But you [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  remember this. Now it's in the states. A lot of states are taking a vote of their citizens [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  and votes are coming out both ways, but largely they're coming in with a certain number of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=648.92s)]
*  weeks. And the number 15 is mentioned. I haven't agreed to any number. I'm going to see. We [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=653.72s)]
*  want to take an issue that was very polarizing and get it settled and solved so everybody [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=659.52s)]
*  can be happy. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=665.24s)]
*  But I will say this. You look at the Democratic view, let's say the Democrats view. That was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  a very radical view because they're willing to kill a baby on the seventh, eighth, ninth [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=672.8s)]
*  month. One thing, and you can look at polling all the all you want. When you get after a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=677.24s)]
*  certain number of months, I mean, especially you get into six, seven, eight, nine and after [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=681.64s)]
*  birth. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't want that to happen. I mean, almost everybody. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=690.36s)]
*  Northam who made that comment about, you know, first the baby's born and then we'll take [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=692.36s)]
*  care of it, make it comfortable. And then the doctor and the mother will decide. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ7Te_2s7I&t=697.48s)]
