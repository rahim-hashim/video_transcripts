# Judge Jeanine: Let’s be clear about what the Green New Deal really is
**Fox News:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Judge Janene Pirro in Tonight for Sean. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=2.6s)]
*  And tonight, with just 67 days until the election, Kamala Harris finally sat down for her very [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=6.12s)]
*  first TV interview of the campaign, with CNN, a so-called news network, all but rooting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=12.76s)]
*  for Harris to win the election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=19.8s)]
*  Kamala was also joined by her running mate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=22.12s)]
*  He was apparently there for emotional support. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=25.16s)]
*  And still, from what we've seen so far, the interview did not go well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=28.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=34.08s)]
*  Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=35.08s)]
*  and decisions is my values have not changed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  You mentioned the Green New Deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=45.84s)]
*  I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=48.6s)]
*  it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=54.6s)]
*  to deadlines around time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=60.44s)]
*  We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=63.56s)]
*  We have set goals for the United States of America and, by extension, the globe around [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=65.88s)]
*  when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=70.76s)]
*  an example. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=75.16s)]
*  That value has not changed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=76.36s)]
*  My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=78.08s)]
*  I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=82.32s)]
*  organizations, violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage, of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  guns, drugs and human beings across our border. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=94.08s)]
*  My values have not changed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=96.72s)]
*  The important takeaway from that rambling answer? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=98.8s)]
*  Kamala's values haven't changed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  She even discussed the Green New Deal, which she co-sponsored in the Senate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  So let's be clear about what the Green New Deal really is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=109.92s)]
*  Now, this truly insane piece of legislation simply calls on capitalism to be replaced [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=113.72s)]
*  with socialism in order to save the planet from climate change. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=120.0s)]
*  It calls for an end to all fossil fuels, no more oil, no more gas, no more gas stoves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=125.08s)]
*  So according to a CNN summary, it also tries to phase out cattle production in the United [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=132.68s)]
*  States, at least as much as is, quote, feasible. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=139.52s)]
*  Eventually, no more cows, no more steak, no more burgers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=144.08s)]
*  It mandates renovations for every single building and home in the United States that is not [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=149.52s)]
*  sufficiently energy efficient. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=155.68s)]
*  It calls for a government-guaranteed job, government-guaranteed food and government-guaranteed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=159.06s)]
*  housing for every resident of the United States, legal and illegal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=165.2s)]
*  It also calls on the government to take over the energy industry and parts of the financial [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  industry, similar to what happened in Venezuela, Cuba and the Soviet Union. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=176.16s)]
*  This is full-blown eating out of dumpsters, delivering babies on the street, socialism. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=182.6s)]
*  So Trump's new nickname for the vice president seems particularly fitting. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=189.92s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=194.92s)]
*  I'm here today with a simple message for the American autoworker and for the American worker. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=195.92s)]
*  Your long economic nightmare will very soon be over. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be over. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=205.72s)]
*  But it turned it around. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=206.72s)]
*  With your vote, we will defeat comrade Kamala Harris and we will bring back the American [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=209.48s)]
*  dream bigger, better, stronger and just better, bigger, better. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=215.88s)]
*  We love the American dream. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  You don't hear about the American dream. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=221.96s)]
*  When was the last time you heard about the American dream? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't talk about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=227.68s)]
*  Oh, they copy everything else I do, so I guess that'll be next. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=228.68s)]
*  They'll be copying. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=232.28s)]
*  They'll be saying, oh, the American dream. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09rbZeXXp3A&t=233.28s)]
