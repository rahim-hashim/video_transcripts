# There is ‘so much wrong’ with this case: Alina Habba
**Fox News:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA)
*  All right, as we mentioned at the top of the show tonight, we have major breaking news [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=0.0s)]
*  out of New York City, where, well, very abusively biased Judge Juan Mershon announced the sentencing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=7.16s)]
*  of former President Donald J. Trump has been postponed until after the election on November. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=14.6s)]
*  Now, Trump has been awaiting sentencing for months after getting convicted on these 34 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  counts of falsifying business records in what was one of the most clear, obvious witch hunts [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=25.96s)]
*  of all times, and featuring a conflicted judge, a jury pool drawn from one of the most liberal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=31.92s)]
*  parts of the country, and, of course, a completely made-up crime using a novel legal theory specifically [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=38.96s)]
*  designed just to get Trump convicted. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=46.22s)]
*  Anyway, here with more is Trump campaign senior legal advisor and spokesperson Alina [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=48.96s)]
*  Mahab is with us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=54.4s)]
*  Alina, this case is probably the most egregious. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=55.4s)]
*  In New York, this would be a misdemeanor case. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=60.08s)]
*  The statute of limitations had run out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=62.28s)]
*  So they come up with this creative novel idea that this very abusively biased judge goes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=64.66s)]
*  along with that somehow turns it into multiple felonies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=70.28s)]
*  They pack felony upon felony, and they bring this case to court under a theory that had [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  never been used before. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=83.0s)]
*  And here we are, and then we have a Supreme Court decision on immunity, which would mandate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=85.52s)]
*  this judge vacate that verdict considering evidence presented to that jury was from the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=91.96s)]
*  time when Donald Trump was doing his official duties as president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=98.32s)]
*  But yet the judge is not going to consider that, or is he really considering it but doesn't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  want to tell us until after the election? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  Your guess is as good as mine is, Sean. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=112.2s)]
*  The reality of the situation is this case never should have been brought. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Cy Vance passed on it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=117.48s)]
*  So did Alvin Bragg. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=118.84s)]
*  But then the president decided to run for office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=120.48s)]
*  So that's why we are here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=122.94s)]
*  Judge Mershon's decision today, while it does show some deference, is still flawed in my [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  opinion because of one thing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=129.6s)]
*  Like you said, the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in this country, a country [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=132.0s)]
*  based on the Constitution, separation of powers, we have that in place for a reason. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=136.84s)]
*  They said that a president is immune, and that's all presidents, not just President [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=141.72s)]
*  Trump, from these types of political or any, frankly, prosecution, persecution, civilly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=145.64s)]
*  or criminally. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=151.3s)]
*  And the fact that he is kicking the can down the road while it's appreciated because he [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=152.88s)]
*  doesn't want to appear to be doing what I and you have called election interference, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  which is what it is, is great. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=160.84s)]
*  However, this case should be, frankly, dismissed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=162.84s)]
*  There was testimony on this case at the time of trial from people that were sitting in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=165.32s)]
*  the Oval from the president's team, evidence that should never have been brought in under [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=170.16s)]
*  the Supreme Court decision. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  So hitting the can down the road, I appreciate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=177.44s)]
*  But quite honestly, Sean, this should be vacated in its entirety. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  It should be. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=184.96s)]
*  I mean, was there not evidence presented? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=185.96s)]
*  For example, Hope Hicks testimony would be one example, but weren't there multiple examples [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=188.76s)]
*  of evidence presented to the jury that should, that would fall under the Supreme Court decision [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=194.36s)]
*  on immunity that should not have been allowed into evidence, which would cause Mershon to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=202.36s)]
*  vacate that verdict, wouldn't it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  And not only were there multiple witnesses brought from the administration while he was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  in the office, but President Trump himself was sitting at the Oval in the Resolute Desk [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  while this was happening. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=223.36s)]
*  The acts they claim the payback by an attorney for an NDA was during the time that President [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=225.28s)]
*  Trump was in the Oval. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  The entire case is flawed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  It is past the statute of limitations. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=235.08s)]
*  It was purely brought for political reasons. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=236.78s)]
*  We know this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=238.8s)]
*  And when you bring DOJ officials onto the DA's office in a state court for felonies, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=239.8s)]
*  it's a joke. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=245.4s)]
*  There's so much wrong with this case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=246.4s)]
*  It should be completely admonished. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=248.4s)]
*  The judge should be admonished, in my opinion, for not, for not telling, recusing, number [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=251.08s)]
*  one, for not dismissing and for continuing to waste taxpayer dollars. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=256.04s)]
*  This is a joke and an atrocity that the American people and the city of New York is seeing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=260.2s)]
*  it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=264.36s)]
*  That's why they've got crime and that's why people are fleeing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=265.36s)]
*  No, I totally agree. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=268.92s)]
*  We had another court case this week and I want to get into that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=269.92s)]
*  And this had to do with the D.C. case and the special prosecutor in this case, who, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=272.7s)]
*  By the way, the legitimacy of the appointment of this prosecutor is in question, as we saw [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=279.08s)]
*  down in Florida. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=283.08s)]
*  The entire case was thrown out by Judge Eileen Cannon. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=284.64s)]
*  I think that would be applicable here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=288.84s)]
*  But the prosecutor refiles the case and the judge this week then goes on to say, okay, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=291.64s)]
*  well, we're not going to try the case before the election because they don't have time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  with all the motions that will be going forward, but they are going to allow this weaponized [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=304.2s)]
*  DOJ to put out prejudicial information against Donald Trump that will not be refuted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=308.88s)]
*  It will not be sworn testimony as a means again of impacting an election while the vote [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=315.2s)]
*  is going on. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=320.4s)]
*  What happened to the 60 90 day rule or practice of the DOJ in the past? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=321.56s)]
*  Is that dead, gone and buried? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=326.48s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=330.08s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=331.08s)]
*  Jack Smith has been ridiculed and completely taken back from having any authority as we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=332.08s)]
*  know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=338.36s)]
*  Now, they've appealed that, but there's no decision on that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=339.36s)]
*  And as you said, this is the issue, Sean. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=341.16s)]
*  We can say that trials will get kicked back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=343.62s)]
*  Decisions on sentencing will get kicked back. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=345.88s)]
*  But we have to hold accountable the people here that are influencing an election because [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=347.82s)]
*  that is what this is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=351.64s)]
*  They want to bring up appeals, bring up rehash old news that is frankly fake news. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=353.0s)]
*  And we have to, as the American people, try and sift through that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=358.6s)]
*  That is election interference as it at its finest. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=361.76s)]
*  It's improper and we don't get a chance to go to trial and rebut it and show the American [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=364.84s)]
*  people what a joke this is. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=368.96s)]
*  But it will come to November 5th. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=371.52s)]
*  I think the American people are frankly getting it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  They're sick of it and they want to hear about policy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=375.32s)]
*  They don't want lawfare anymore. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate your time, Alina. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  How about thank you as always. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXDCpoeHRA&t=394.84s)]
