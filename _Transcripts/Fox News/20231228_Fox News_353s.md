# Tulsi Gabbard: Every American needs to recognize how dangerous this is
**Fox News:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U)
*  Fox News contributor and former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=0.0s)]
*  Tulsi, great to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=4.5s)]
*  First, your reaction to this move by the secretary of state in Maine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=5.5s)]
*  They want Trump off the ballot. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I think it's really important, Pete, for every single American who's seeing this news [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  alert popping up to recognize how dangerous this is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=18.06s)]
*  You have a secretary of state who is a known partisan, who is known to be against Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=23.1s)]
*  She supported the impeachment of Trump, single-handedly making this decision to say the former president [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=29.02s)]
*  cannot be on the ballot, taking away our right as voters in this country to decide who we [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=35.28s)]
*  want to serve as our next president and commander in chief. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=40.9s)]
*  You take away the party labels, you take away the names of Trump versus Biden, recognize [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=44.64s)]
*  how dangerous this is, where if this is allowed to stand, one person, one person gets to take [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=49.64s)]
*  away the voices and the rights of every single American to engage in our democratic process. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=57.14s)]
*  That is literally what is at stake here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  So whether people like Trump or don't like Trump or like Biden, don't like Biden, that's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=65.06s)]
*  not the point here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=69.48s)]
*  If you're a Democrat or Republican, now is the time that we as Americans must stand up [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=70.48s)]
*  for our democratic process in this country and our right and our voices to decide our [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=74.88s)]
*  future. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=81.42s)]
*  Pelsie, I remember months ago, when the rumors inside the political, you know, chats and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=83.42s)]
*  others were saying, well, they might try to remove him from the ballot in certain states, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=89.1s)]
*  and it felt like no way they're going to pursue this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=93.78s)]
*  Now they've tried state after state after state. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=95.78s)]
*  They've succeeded in some. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=98.58s)]
*  It looks like Colorado may be walking back, but now Maine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=99.86s)]
*  Others are looking to try it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=102.42s)]
*  Is this in the DNA of the modern Democrat Party? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing it through political persecution, but if they could, would they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=108.5s)]
*  remove him from the ballot altogether? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=112.06s)]
*  Yes, I have no doubt about that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=114.06s)]
*  This is the M.O. of the Democrat elite. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=117.4s)]
*  They will stop at nothing to try to maintain their power, even if it means taking away [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=120.92s)]
*  the right to vote of Americans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=125.86s)]
*  So they have no issue taking Trump off the ballot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=128.74s)]
*  They have no issue pursuing him and persecuting him through a weaponized and politicized Department [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=131.3s)]
*  of Justice. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=136.62s)]
*  They have no qualms about doing whatever they feel is necessary to hold onto power. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=137.78s)]
*  It's ridiculous that we are having this conversation here in the United States of America. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=143.82s)]
*  When you and I have heard and we've seen how the Warhawks in Washington, they will see [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=148.62s)]
*  this happen in another country and they'll be very quick to say, we must go and intervene. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=152.66s)]
*  We must go and topple this banana republic or this dictatorship. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=156.78s)]
*  Many of these very same people are the people who are driving this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=161.02s)]
*  And it's not just Democrats. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=164.02s)]
*  They're Republicans who are threatened by President Trump's unwillingness to buy into [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=165.94000000000003s)]
*  their establishment ways. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that eagerness to protect foreign nations, a great example you've [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  talked about a lot, is Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=180.78s)]
*  We're very concerned about their border, yet you just heard the numbers I reported [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  about our own. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=186.34s)]
*  What's the goal here? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Blinken's listening to Mexico. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=189.46s)]
*  They're doing nothing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  Numbers are at record levels. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=192.78000000000003s)]
*  What's the goal of Democrats? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=194.58s)]
*  You know, it's hard to say, Pete. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=197.9s)]
*  I feel like the Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration are trying to put their head [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=199.58s)]
*  in the sand here saying, hey, guys, there's nothing to see here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=204.78s)]
*  You heard the White House press secretary saying, well, these are very normal, normal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  things happening at the border. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=212.36s)]
*  You have in that meeting with the leader of Mexico saying, well, these are just irregular [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=214.34s)]
*  migrant movements. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  It is a complete denial of what every American is seeing, some more than others, depending [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=221.58s)]
*  on where you are, of what's happening in our country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  It poses a direct threat to our national security. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=229.58s)]
*  They have no idea who these people are who are coming across the border. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=232.02s)]
*  We do know that they're coming from around the world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=235.44s)]
*  We do know that these are not just poor women and children who are trying to escape oppressive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=238.28s)]
*  conditions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=244.46s)]
*  This is a very real direct threat to our national security. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=245.62s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration is undermining our safety and security and also undermining [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=248.3s)]
*  leaders in this country, their ability to provide for the basic needs of Americans. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=254.74s)]
*  We're seeing more and more cities saying, hey, sorry, guys, we got to cut the budget [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=258.7s)]
*  for things like education, things like sanitation, picking up the trash and sewage system, things [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=261.98s)]
*  like public safety, funding our police officers so they can keep your community safe, because [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  those funds have to go towards providing for housing and shelter and food and care for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=271.74s)]
*  those who are breaking our laws, entering our country illegally. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=277.42s)]
*  And even places like New York are saying, no, we don't like the shelters you're giving [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=280.34s)]
*  us. You got to give us more a nicer a nicer place to stay. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=283.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly how they look at it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=290.1s)]
*  Is there would there be a place? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=291.7s)]
*  I mean, is there a place at all in the modern Democrat Party for a view of enforcing the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=293.7s)]
*  border? Or is it really the way Minnesota is going, which is any illegal can get a driver's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  license? The way New York's going, where noncitizens can vote? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=303.58s)]
*  Is this a electoral strategy? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=306.82s)]
*  Real quick amongst Democrats, are they importing voters? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=309.3s)]
*  I think it's a valid question to ask. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=313.78s)]
*  I think there are many Democrats like myself across the country who are disgusted with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=315.62s)]
*  the direction the Democratic Party has taken, but who are unlike me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=319.82s)]
*  I left the party. They're afraid to speak up because they see how the Democrat leaders [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=324.7s)]
*  will smear, destroy and try to cancel anyone who doesn't go along with their narrative. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, you always set it straight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glGMDshBk1U&t=339.65999999999997s)]
