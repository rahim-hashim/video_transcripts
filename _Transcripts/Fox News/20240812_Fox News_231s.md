# Lara Trump: The jig is up
**Fox News:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo)
*  Tonight, the Harris-Walls ticket is crumbling under scrutiny, and the vetting has only begun. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, GOP co-chair Laura Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=5.28s)]
*  First of all, I'm a little concerned. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=8.4s)]
*  They're hacking your father-in-law's website. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  My understanding is he has the top cybersecurity people that have put it together. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  We're not dealing with amateurs here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=16.84s)]
*  Now they have gone hard after Elon Musk tonight and limiting the number of people that could [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=19.72s)]
*  listen to your father-in-law earlier tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  On top of that, then you have the EU. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=29.56s)]
*  They're going after Musk in a way that sounds like they want to prosecute the guy criminally [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=32.24s)]
*  because he believes in freedom of speech and the platform called X. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=37.08s)]
*  That sounds pretty authoritarian to me and downright dangerous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=41.8s)]
*  Why is this happening? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=45.84s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, I think it's pretty obvious at this point. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=46.84s)]
*  There are a lot of people out there, and there's a massive effort, of course, to keep Donald [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=50.96s)]
*  Trump out of the White House. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=55.16s)]
*  These people are terrified. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  This is the deep state. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=57.96s)]
*  This is the swamp in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=59.48s)]
*  These are the people who are our adversaries in many cases, and they know that the jig [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=61.4s)]
*  is up, the game is over, when Donald J. Trump returns to the White House, and they're petrified [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=66.08s)]
*  of it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=70.64s)]
*  They have had a free pass for three and a half years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=71.64s)]
*  The people who want to do nefarious activities to us here in America, to our allies around [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=74.4s)]
*  the world, they've gotten a free pass and a free ride, and they would like another four [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=79.4s)]
*  years of that with Kamala Harris at the helm. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=83.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is the only person who can deliver this country back to we the people, the only [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=85.88s)]
*  person who can make sure that the world is stabilized once again. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=90.64s)]
*  And there are, I assume, Sean, a lot of people out there who don't want to see that happen [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=95.28s)]
*  for really awful reasons, quite frankly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=100.32s)]
*  What I can tell you is that none of this deters Donald Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=103.36s)]
*  His resolve has never been stronger to become the 47th president of the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=106.88s)]
*  And I think, quite frankly, the more attacks like this you see, the more pushback against [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=112.06s)]
*  Donald Trump and the more they go out of their way to try and stop this man, whether it's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=117.12s)]
*  indictments, whether it's impeachments, quite frankly, whether it's a bullet, it just shows [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=121.98s)]
*  the American people this is the only person who would still be in this fight going strong. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=126.7s)]
*  It's Donald J. Trump, and I believe that's why he'll be our next president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  I get asked this question all the time, and you're in a much better position to answer [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=135.78s)]
*  it as it relates to get out the vote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=139.58s)]
*  The ground game that you have, early voting, voting by mail, legal ballot harvesting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=142.02s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=146.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=147.9s)]
*  Well, look, we have a huge operation underway. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=148.9s)]
*  We are pleased to announce that although Michael Watley, the chairman of the RNC and I, pledged [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=152.3s)]
*  100,000 volunteers as part of our election integrity program when we first took the helm [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=157.26s)]
*  of things back in March, Sean, right now we have 157,000 people who have volunteered to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=161.78s)]
*  be poll watchers, poll workers, work in the tabulation centers, be legal experts on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=167.54s)]
*  ground. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=172.78s)]
*  But we want more. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=173.78s)]
*  And what we really need, Sean, are attorneys. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=174.78s)]
*  If you are an attorney out there, we will train you in election law. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=177.5s)]
*  You don't need to be trained in this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  Protectthevote.com is the website. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=182.22s)]
*  Look, I think people around the country have very clearly seen what Kamala Harris has to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  offer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  We've had it for three and a half years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  And if you thought it's bad under Joe and Kamala, imagine that on steroids, because [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=191.72s)]
*  Kamala and Tim Walz, of course. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=196.5s)]
*  People want Donald Trump back in the White House. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  And we believe when every legal vote is counted and only legal votes are counted, that means [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=201.34s)]
*  Donald Trump is our next president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=205.22s)]
*  We can't do it alone, though. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=207.06s)]
*  Protectthevote.com. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=208.58s)]
*  We need every volunteer out there to come be part of our team. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=209.78s)]
*  And people go there that can help and join on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=213.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=216.02s)]
*  Thank you, Laura Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=217.02s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25s8WqxrGKo&t=218.02s)]
