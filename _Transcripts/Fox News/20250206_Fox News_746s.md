# Hannity: This should shock the conscience of every American
**Fox News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI)
*  Welcome to Hannity and the Trump White House is off to a lightning start fast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't blink, you probably will miss a massive development. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=4.88s)]
*  In fact, no one in the state-run legacy media mob or the Democratic Party, they can't really [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=8.24s)]
*  keep up with the speed of Donald Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=14.08s)]
*  They just know how to feign outrage every second of every day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=16.48s)]
*  That's all they know. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=20.8s)]
*  Now, there have been dozens of critical executive orders, diplomacy all over the globe, confirmations [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=22.04s)]
*  across the board, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will join us in just a moment [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=28.9s)]
*  for her first interview as attorney general. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=34.14s)]
*  We have also witnessed a multi-front effort to demolish woke politics, restore integrity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=36.58s)]
*  and fairness at every federal institution. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=41.94s)]
*  But perhaps President Trump's most consequential action was tapping Elon Musk to lead the brand [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=45.42s)]
*  new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ for short. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=51.5s)]
*  Now, according to Democrats and their friends in the legacy media mob, Elon Musk, he's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=55.58s)]
*  a dangerous man with bad intentions, an unelected billionaire who's looking out for himself, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=60.7s)]
*  one Democrat even suggesting he wants your money. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=67.34s)]
*  Trust me, Elon doesn't want or need your money. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=71.1s)]
*  He's got plenty. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=73.86s)]
*  So tonight, we're going to set the record straight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=75.02s)]
*  Elon Musk is the richest man in the world, and there's a reason. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=77.38s)]
*  He's brilliant. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=81.06s)]
*  He's a self-made billionaire, a first-generation immigrant from South Africa. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  He embodies all things that are the American dream. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=87.02s)]
*  Whether you realize it or not, your life has been impacted by Elon Musk. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=90.42s)]
*  He helped to revolutionize electronic banking with PayPal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=94.62s)]
*  He created a new form of high-speed internet using low-orbit satellites, making fast, reliable [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=98.62s)]
*  internet accessible anywhere on Earth. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=104.86s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=107.94s)]
*  Musk even rushed Starlink terminals, you might recall, to North Carolina, Tennessee, after [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=109.02s)]
*  Hurricane Helene, providing the only form of communication in that emergency in the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=114.02s)]
*  aftermath. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  And he did the same for the people of California after the wildfires. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  Musk also reinvented space travel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=124.22s)]
*  It's called SpaceX. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=126.3s)]
*  And soon, probably within the next month or so, Elon Musk will literally be having—well, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=127.86s)]
*  be rescuing astronauts, but he's also going to send—Americans will be landing on Mars. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=134.06s)]
*  And in the coming months, SpaceX will rescue those astronauts that Biden and Harris abandoned [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=140.1s)]
*  and stranded at the International Space Station. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=144.94s)]
*  Musk also spearheaded the development of affordable, high-performance electric vehicles through [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=148.7s)]
*  Tesla, which you would kind of think, you know, Green New Deal Democrats, they'd love [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=154.54s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=159.26s)]
*  Apparently not, because he supports Donald Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=160.66s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=163.98s)]
*  Through Tesla, he has also transformed American manufacturing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=164.98s)]
*  There's also Musk's life-altering Neuralink, the boring company that could one day solve [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=169.1s)]
*  all our traffic problems. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=176.34s)]
*  He's also provided real freedom of speech on X and so much more. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=177.98s)]
*  I mean, the guy is a force of nature. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=182.78s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=184.66s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=185.86s)]
*  We're lucky to have him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=186.86s)]
*  And the truth is, Musk doesn't need to work for free for Donald Trump and the federal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=187.94s)]
*  government and the American people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=192.26s)]
*  He doesn't have to work another day in his life. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=194.26s)]
*  He's worth hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=196.54s)]
*  He doesn't need to lift a finger. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=198.74s)]
*  As Donald Trump would say, he could be on a tropical beach somewhere enjoying life. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=200.98s)]
*  Instead, he's in the Washington swamp. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=205.86s)]
*  He is serving his country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=208.62s)]
*  He's pouring over numbers and data and wading through our federal bureaucracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=210.38s)]
*  He is rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=215.06s)]
*  And he's not doing it for himself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=218.1s)]
*  He's doing it—it's your money. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  That he's finding that it's being abused. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=222.22s)]
*  Elon Musk loves the country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=224.66s)]
*  He's giving back. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=226.62s)]
*  He knows that this is the last best place God ever gave man. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=227.86s)]
*  This is the place where dreams can actually come true. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=231.86s)]
*  But Washington's out-of-control bureaucracy is, of course, standing in the way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=234.74s)]
*  And regulations and the taxes and the abuse, this is all—look at that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  This is all your hard-earned tax dollars being spent abroad. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=243.66s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=249.82s)]
*  And—but for Elon Musk, exposing all of this corruption, you would probably never know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=251.62s)]
*  You know, look at the corruption. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=257.86s)]
*  Years, unelected, federal bureaucrats and elected officials, they have been wasting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=259.94s)]
*  your hard-earned money in ways that are unimaginable for their power, not even in our country, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=265.54s)]
*  but around the globe, you know, on bizarre far-left pet projects, all to advance their [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  radical Green New Deal agenda, their woke policies, DEI, transgenderism, LGBTQ+, initiatives. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=277.66s)]
*  What Musk and his team at Doge uncovered at USAID alone—and there's going to be a lot [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  more to come. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=292.06s)]
*  This is the tip of the iceberg—should shock the conscience of every American. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=293.06s)]
*  This is a waste of your money. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  They're stealing from your children and grandchildren. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=301.66s)]
*  They're stealing your money. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=304.06s)]
*  And among the billions in these woke projects abroad and DEI seminars and transgender plays, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=306.04s)]
*  USAID also reportedly spent $10 million on meals for al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=313.44s)]
*  This is, by far—and if we had real media and journalism wasn't dead—this is the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=320.68s)]
*  biggest financial scandal in the history of our country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=326.48s)]
*  Not millions of dollars, but tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars for these [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=330.6s)]
*  foreign countries. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  And remember, we have nearly $40 trillion in debt. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=338.12s)]
*  Instead of being thankful to Elon Musk, Democrats are livid. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=341.48s)]
*  They are angry. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=346.16s)]
*  They are furious at him for exposing their corruption. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  He exposed the Democrats, wasting your money, your billions and billions of hard-earned [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  on foreign woke radicalism. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=359.12s)]
*  And for this, they hate him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  They also hate him for liking and working for free—he's not getting paid—for Donald [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=364.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  And meanwhile, Joe Biden spent—we have now discovered a whopping $236 billion on improper [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  payments last year alone. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  That's a quarter of a trillion dollars. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  We have homeless veterans freezing to death in the cold. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  We have Americans living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  Fifty-six percent of Americans cannot withstand a $1,000 emergency. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=386.68s)]
*  They don't have the money to pay for it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  Violent criminal, illegal immigrants are inside our country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=396.24s)]
*  They're using your taxpayer money as well. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=399.16s)]
*  Democrats are mad at Elon Musk for trying to hold our elected and unelected government [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=402.8s)]
*  bureaucrats accountable for this waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=408.12s)]
*  You know, that's exactly what President Trump was elected to do, and they're doing it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=412.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=417.04s)]
*  Joe Rogan is dead on right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=442.12s)]
*  And by the way, this is not a constitutional crisis. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=447.56s)]
*  This is a return to constitutional order. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=450.12s)]
*  This is a return to limited government, greater freedom. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=453.24s)]
*  In other words, the principles espoused and envisioned by our founders and our framers. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=457.52s)]
*  Let me walk my Democratic friends through all of this in simple terms. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=464.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris lost. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=468.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is president. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=470.6s)]
*  He's the head of the executive branch. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=472.0s)]
*  He sets the agenda. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=474.28000000000003s)]

*  He appointed Elon Musk to root out this waste, fraud and abuse and corruption. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  And now Trump is parting ways with federal employees who are unwilling or unable to carry [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=485.24s)]
*  out the agenda the American people elected him to perform, along with those that have [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  corrupted our institutions, our FBI, our D.C. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=496.08000000000004s)]

*  Remember, think about this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=506.24s)]
*  With all that waste, fraud and abuse, hundreds of, you know, tens and tens of billions of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=507.64s)]
*  dollars, the average American, average American, makes $66,000 a year. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=512.0s)]
*  You work hard. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=519.72s)]
*  You pay your taxes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=520.72s)]
*  You obey the laws. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=522.08s)]
*  You play by the rules. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=523.08s)]
*  And that's how they spend your money? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=524.08s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=525.68s)]
*  You deserve a refund. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=527.0s)]
*  Democrats currently throw in a temper tantrum. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=528.4s)]
*  It only exposes how frankly pathetic and corrupt they truly are. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=531.16s)]
*  Of course, they're also incompetent. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=535.2s)]
*  And let not your heart be troubled, Musk and his team at DOJ, they will be successful one [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=537.48s)]
*  way or the other. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=542.18s)]
*  He's not going to be intimidated by the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=543.76s)]
*  and, you know, radical Democrats screaming a constitutional crisis because they've [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=548.2s)]
*  been exposed. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=553.44s)]
*  And Musk is not the only person working hard to hold our government accountable. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=554.76s)]
*  Newly confirmed attorney general, Pam Bondi. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=558.56s)]
*  Wow, she's hit the ground running with her own shock and awe. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=561.24s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, she traveled to New Orleans to coordinate security for the Super [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=564.56s)]
*  Bowl. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=568.8s)]
*  She also filed the lawsuit against Chicago and Illinois over their sanctuary city policies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=569.8s)]
*  Other, you know, day one directives included an effort to end the weaponization of our [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=575.36s)]
*  legal system. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=581.06s)]
*  She also reinstated the federal death penalty. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=582.4s)]
*  She terminated DEI at the DOJ, paused funding for sanctuary cities and vowed to work with [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=585.22s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security to completely eliminate drug cartels in our country. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=591.68s)]
*  Needless to say, Democrats are already, you know, smearing Pam Bondi for doing a great [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=597.56s)]
*  job. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=602.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=603.84s)]
*  Essentially, Pam Bondi's first act in office is to order an investigation of the January [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=604.84s)]
*  6th and the classified documents prosecution of Donald Trump. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=610.72s)]
*  That is an outrageous thing to do on your first day. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=614.32s)]
*  She said Pam Bondi did during her confirmation hearing, she would be looking forward. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=616.22s)]
*  Seemed to say, suggest that she would not be targeting any employees, that she was just [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  going to do the work of the justice system. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=624.12s)]
*  But in her first act as attorney general, promising to investigate the investigators [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=631.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that message is pretty clear. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=632.58s)]
*  If anybody is weaponizing these two agencies, it's the people who are about to take over. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=634.68s)]
*  And I note that Pam Bondi, she just created a weaponizing task force. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=641.68s)]
*  What the heck is that? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=651.64s)]
*  Except once again, turning inward and looking at the people, the brave people who are working [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=653.48s)]
*  in the DOJ and FBI and looking at them saying, are you next? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=660.56s)]
*  These are crazy times. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=665.56s)]
*  Now after the 2024 election, anger, loathing, rage are the only things the Democrats have [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=670.0s)]
*  left. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=675.52s)]
*  Of course, Pam Bondi will have a tough road ahead. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=676.52s)]
*  According to Bordesar Tom Homan, the violent Venezuelan gang, Trende Aragua, was tipped [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=679.04s)]
*  off by someone prior to ICE raids that were to take place in Denver. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=684.28s)]
*  Now Tom Homan is vowing to fight back. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=689.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=691.7199999999999s)]
*  We're not going to tolerate it anymore. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  This is not a game. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  When we show up at these sites, this is a dangerous job for the men and women of ICE [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=695.7199999999999s)]
*  and Border Patrol and all the DOJ agencies. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=699.88s)]
*  To have this type of interference puts our officers at great risk. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=703.2399999999999s)]
*  Not only the officers, it puts the aliens at great risk, because anything can happen [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=706.16s)]
*  when we take our eyes off the goal here. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=709.68s)]
*  So we're addressing that immediately today. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=711.68s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=713.64s)]
*  This is serious business, and they need to stop or we won't prosecute them through the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  Department of Justice. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=718.96s)]
*  So tonight the big question, how will Bondi work with the DHS to fix our broken immigration [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=721.08s)]
*  system while also making much needed reforms to the DOJ to stop its weaponization, rooting [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=726.12s)]
*  out those who are actively working against the Trump administration? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcNynWmC5zI&t=732.2s)]
