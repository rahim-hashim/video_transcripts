# ‘SWAMP CREATURE’: Sean Duffy fires back at Hillary Clinton’s DOGE attack
**Fox News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY)
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, like everybody, I mean, you know, it's all shock and awe, but when you go back to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=3.2s)]
*  the DEI policies—and we didn't really—the word woke was not a big part of the vernacular, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=9.36s)]
*  even in Donald Trump's first term. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=16.2s)]
*  But when they put in DEI policies that would allow the hiring at the FAA of people with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=18.8s)]
*  intellectual and psychiatric disabilities, and I read that, that was shock and awe to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=25.4s)]
*  me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=32.12s)]
*  Well, you know, Sean, I want to look at what was the focus of the department, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=33.12s)]
*  The main focus, back to the history, was safety. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=38.4s)]
*  The problem is they were focusing on, as you mentioned, the environment, EVs, changing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=41.64s)]
*  language for social justice. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=46.72s)]
*  They want to be politically correct. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=49.8s)]
*  And when you don't focus on your systems and your safety, bad things happen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=53.46s)]
*  And so I looked at this last week. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=56.94s)]
*  You haven't seen anyone drain the swamp more than Donald Trump has done in the last [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=59.0s)]
*  week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  And when you do that, these swamp creatures raise their heads like Hillary Clinton has, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  and they push back and they lash out, even though they're irrelevant. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=67.5s)]
*  But it goes to the point that our transportation system, our air traffic control system, we're [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=70.78s)]
*  using World War II technology. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=75.98s)]
*  And it should have been updated, you know, 10, 20, 30 years ago. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=78.18s)]
*  And so, again, I think Democrats right now, they're upset about Elon Musk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=81.82s)]
*  But in my position, I have had conversations with Donald Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  He says, listen, I want the best system in the world, the most technologically advanced [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=88.74s)]
*  system in the world, talk to the best minds. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to go to the Hill, talk to the best minds. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go to industry, talk to the best minds. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  But the guy who launches rockets into space and catches them when they come back down, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=99.02s)]
*  I sure as hell am going to talk to that guy, too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  It'd be malpractice if I didn't. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  When these lefties lose their mind, when we're going to move at the speed of Trump or Elon [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=108.2s)]
*  Musk, they want us to move at the speed of bureaucrats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=112.84s)]
*  And so, again, the wall policy, it's gone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=115.84s)]
*  It's safety first and reforming air traffic control that's going to make the system not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  just safer, but more efficient. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=124.08s)]
*  So you're not going to have canceled flights or delayed flights. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=126.16s)]
*  You're going to have an air traffic control system that works. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Sean, I was talking to Elon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=131.2s)]
*  I said, what, can we do this, Elon? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=132.32s)]
*  What, two and a half, three years can we make this happen? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  And he was like, no, no. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=136.28s)]
*  Two and a half, three years? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=138.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=139.0s)]
*  We could do this in one year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=140.0s)]
*  When you have these 22-year-old young people who are smart and can engage and give us good [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=141.18s)]
*  advice, we'll move at the speed of business as opposed to the speed of bureaucracy and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=147.16s)]
*  government. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=151.64s)]
*  You know, to be an air traffic controller, you need really, really critical skills. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=152.64s)]
*  You need to be able to multitask like nobody else. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=158.64s)]
*  You need to be able to make fast decisions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=161.28s)]
*  You've got to be very smart. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=163.8s)]
*  We kept reading—I kept reading all these stories about people that would get 100 percent [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=165.92s)]
*  on an exam to be an air traffic controller that wouldn't get hired, and we find out [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=170.84s)]
*  later why. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=175.72s)]
*  And that, to me, is frustrating. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=177.72s)]
*  Do you believe that we'd be—that within a year, we can hire the personnel that is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=179.84s)]
*  and upgrade the avionics, the electronics that are necessary for our air—you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=187.72s)]
*  for the air that we fly in to be safe, airways to be safe? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=196.6s)]
*  So we can walk in—we can walk in to go at the same time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=201.32s)]
*  So we can work on the air traffic control system as well as—you know, we have a plan [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=203.84s)]
*  to get rid of the bottlenecks, get more of the smartest kids into the air traffic control [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=208.4s)]
*  academy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=213.04s)]
*  But Sean, once they graduate, it takes them a year to three years to get trained up in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=214.08s)]
*  a tower, so that's going to take time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=217.84s)]
*  But I'm going to make an offer to air traffic controllers to let them stay longer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=219.96s)]
*  That's my authority. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=224.0s)]
*  I can offer them the chance to stay longer, past the mandatory retirement age of 56, pay [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=225.0s)]
*  them more, give them a bonus, keep them on the job, make the system safer, alleviate [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=230.28s)]
*  the pressure on the controllers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=234.96s)]
*  They'll make more money. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=236.44s)]
*  Hopefully they'll say yes to that great offer. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to make them in the coming days. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  By the way, that's a brilliant idea. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=241.08s)]
*  The mandatory retirement of 56, that's insane. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=243.88s)]
*  These are the best, most experienced people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=246.24s)]
*  Yeah, brilliant idea. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  Sean, please keep us updated. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=250.88s)]
*  Congratulations on your new position. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7VyLPy3kY&t=252.8s)]
