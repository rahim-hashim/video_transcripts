# THE STRUGGLE IS REAL: Biden needs help answering basic questions, says Hannity
**Fox News:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs)
*  Now, as tensions are rising across the country, the president, a self-proclaimed healer of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=0.0s)]
*  souls, has gone noticeably missing and quiet. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=6.24s)]
*  He desperately needs this radical base to show up for him in November. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=10.0s)]
*  So Joe has been trashing Netanyahu and Israel while trying to ignore the hate-filled protests [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=14.3s)]
*  of the left. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=20.36s)]
*  He's trying to walk a tightrope. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=21.52s)]
*  And as we all know, well, Biden does not have very good balance in any regard. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=23.3s)]
*  Anyway, now he's falling in the polls in a major way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=28.52s)]
*  Don't take it from me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=32.36s)]
*  Let's look at this, a brand-new poll from CNN. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=33.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has now opened up a whopping six-point lead nationwide, nearly double the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=35.96s)]
*  margin of error. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=41.4s)]
*  When you throw in the third-party candidates, Donald Trump's lead swells to nine points. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=42.8s)]
*  The key driver behind these numbers? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=47.8s)]
*  Well, the economy and immigration. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=49.92s)]
*  According to the same CNN poll, 66 percent of voters disapprove of Joe Biden's handling [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=52.8s)]
*  of the economy, and it is not just fake news, CNN. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=59.16s)]
*  Let's look at the CBS poll from three key battleground states, showing that a large [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  plurality of Americans believe they would be much better off financially if Donald [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=68.12s)]
*  Trump wins in November. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=73.28s)]
*  In Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, an overwhelming majority of voters believe the economy was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=75.52s)]
*  better under Donald Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=81.24s)]
*  Most believe the economy has gotten worse since the end of the pandemic, and that's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=82.96s)]
*  not all. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=86.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has now pulled ahead when it comes to an important question. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=87.88s)]
*  Who better understands people like you? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=91.52s)]
*  They can't answer, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=94.64s)]
*  Now, this is all on the heels of last week's Bloomberg morning console polls showing Donald [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump winning six out of seven swing states. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=103.32s)]
*  And don't forget Gallup. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=106.08s)]
*  They have a poll out finding that Joe Biden is the least popular president in modern history [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=107.12s)]
*  the last 70 years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=112.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, a new Harvard-Harris poll also finding that Trump is leading nationwide in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=114.44s)]
*  both a head-to-head matchup with Biden and a three-way matchup against Biden and RFK [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=119.68s)]
*  Jr. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And get this, the polls showed that 57 percent of Americans believe that Democrats are, quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  the legal system in biased ways to take out a political opponent. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=131.68s)]
*  And 64 percent indicated that Biden's cognitive decline is getting worse every single day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  The polls now are so bad that during a podcast featuring Biden, Clinton and Obama, all actor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=141.72s)]
*  Jason Bateman suggested that Joe, why don't you go on Hannity's program for an hour and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=147.68s)]
*  defend your great record. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=152.36s)]
*  But instead of providing a thoughtful answer, well, he needed his predecessor. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=154.32s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=160.4s)]
*  Well, when he, not his predecessor, but his former partner, Barack Obama to step in, leading [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=161.4s)]
*  to a lot of questions, really. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=168.72s)]
*  How much influence does Obama have over Joe Biden? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=170.56s)]
*  You decide. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=173.32s)]
*  You, and you've got very smart people to suggest what it is that you do, but like, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=174.32s)]
*  could it be as simple as just like granting an hour to Sean Hannity and sit down and go, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=180.76s)]
*  You tell me why the people who follow you think I'm not a good president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=184.68s)]
*  And just answer his questions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=192.32s)]
*  Call us bluff. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=194.0s)]
*  I mean, because the information, the facts are all there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=195.0s)]
*  It's particularly for that group of people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=199.16s)]
*  What you do is so much better suited than what the other agenda is talking about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=203.28s)]
*  So is it just a matter of just getting on that network? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=208.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=210.28s)]
*  First of all, you guys are exactly right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  Joe's got an unbelievable record of accomplishments. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=214.72s)]
*  The question was to Joe, not to Barack. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  Barack felt the need to jump in and answer for Joe because he knows he's not capable [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=221.6s)]
*  of answering. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=225.44s)]
*  Now, by the way, just to be official, Joe is more than welcome on this program for the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=226.44s)]
*  entire hour, and I'll give him an extra three hours of uninterrupted radio time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=231.16s)]
*  But I don't think Joe can handle a live segment on MSDNC, much less an entire hour on this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=236.72s)]
*  program. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=242.12s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=243.16s)]
*  This doesn't look good for Joe. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=245.04s)]
*  He needs help answering basic questions. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=247.28s)]
*  He struggles. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=249.4s)]
*  He mumbles. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=250.4s)]
*  He bumbles. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=251.4s)]
*  He stumbles. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=252.4s)]
*  He's having a hard time walking and talking. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=253.4s)]
*  And let's not forget when, you know, he read the instructions from the teleprompter, like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=254.76s)]
*  an elderly Ron Burgundy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=258.76s)]
*  Four more years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=261.24s)]
*  Pause. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=262.24s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=263.24s)]
*  You know, from the economy to inflation to illegal immigration to violence in the Middle [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=264.24s)]
*  East, war in Europe to the obvious cognitive decline. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=268.48s)]
*  It is no secret why Biden is hemorrhaging support from several usually reliable demographics. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=272.32s)]
*  Then, of course, he's out there talking about his dear uncle that was eaten by cannibals. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=278.08s)]
*  But anyway, I digress. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=284.84s)]
*  But it's not stopping Democrats and strategic, you know, minds that are in the Democratic [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=286.55999999999995s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  James Carvald's a lot of things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  I've debated him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Smart guy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  And he's getting really pissed off. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=298.11999999999995s)]
*  So I hear this a lot. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=299.6s)]
*  Young, James Young voters are just not into this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=303.52s)]
*  It's two candidates. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=307.12s)]
*  One's in the 80s. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=308.96s)]
*  One is almost in the 80s. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=309.96s)]
*  And they're concerned about things that Washington politicians. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=311.72s)]
*  And you just can't blame them for, oh, **** you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=318.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=323.56s)]
*  Are you watching what is happening in the Supreme Court? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=324.8s)]
*  If you're 2060, you see what they're doing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=328.8s)]
*  First of all, they're going to take every right that you could possibly have away from [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=331.08s)]
*  you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=335.24s)]
*  If Trump and Roberts and Alito and Gossage and Thomas and Leonard Leo and the Heritage [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=336.24s)]
*  Foundation, if they get a hold, there will be no government left. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=347.8s)]
*  There'll be no rights left. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=352.68s)]
*  You'll live under theocracy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=354.64s)]
*  You'll end up with Christian nationalism. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=356.44s)]
*  That's all right, you little ****, 26 year old. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  You don't feel like the election's important. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  They're not addressing the issues that I care about. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=363.12s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  With Joe unable to communicate effectively, Democrats are once again rolling out, well, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=368.6s)]
*  they're not so secret weapon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  V.P. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=375.24s)]
*  Harris. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=375.72s)]
*  And recently, during a pretty grotesque, fawning interview with Drew Barrymore, Kamala spoke [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=376.24s)]
*  out against those who dare to criticize her constant, inappropriate, weird giggling and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=383.08s)]
*  laughing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=388.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=388.76s)]
*  You know, you were asking me earlier about what it means to be like the first woman. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=390.44s)]
*  And, you know, it's funny because people still got to get used to this, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=394.52s)]
*  I mean, my staff, for example, sometimes they'll show me little things that just amuse me. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=398.64s)]
*  Like, apparently some people love to talk about the way I laugh. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=404.64s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  I love your laugh. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=409.2s)]
*  Well, let me just tell you something. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=410.08s)]
*  I have my mother's laugh. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=411.6s)]
*  And I grew up around a bunch of women in particular who laughed from the belly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=413.6s)]
*  They laughed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=419.16s)]
*  They would sit around the kitchen and drink their coffee, telling big stories with big [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=420.16s)]
*  laughs. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=424.8s)]
*  You know, I'm never going to be, I'm just, I'm not that person. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=425.6s)]
*  Now, there's really only one way to stop Kamala from laughing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=432.6s)]
*  Vote her out of office. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=436.24s)]
*  That would be 189 days from now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=438.0s)]
*  And you can send her boss, Joe Biden, to finally retire on the beach in Delaware. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=440.56s)]
*  Maybe he'll build up his muscles and be able to pull along his beach chair. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_f6peNnCs&t=445.44s)]
