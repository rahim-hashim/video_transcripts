# Ted Cruz: I think they're gonna 'pull the cord' on Joe Biden
**Fox News:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y)
*  Here with analysis, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, I've been saying that whatever the Democrats do, it's not going to matter, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=3.04s)]
*  because the same failed policies will be in place. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=8.2s)]
*  This entire party has been radicalized, and there are no moderate Democrats that exist. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=11.28s)]
*  It's an extinct species. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=17.2s)]
*  Look, sadly, that's right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I think the odds are about 80 percent that they're going to pull the cord on Joe Biden. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=22.36s)]
*  I think his cognitive disabilities are so enormous now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing the New York Times bail on him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=30.44s)]
*  You're seeing NBC bail on him. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=32.56s)]
*  You're seeing Nancy Pelosi bail on him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=33.88s)]
*  You're seeing George Clooney bail on him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=36.04s)]
*  I think they're going to pull the cord, but it doesn't matter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=38.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter if they replace Joe Biden with Michelle Obama or they replace Joe Biden [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=41.2s)]
*  with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  They all support the same disastrous policies, out-of-control spending and debt that is driving [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=46.84s)]
*  inflation and open borders. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=52.44s)]
*  Look, it was really striking as I was listening to your monologue that Joe Biden opened borders. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  He opened up the border, but it was Kamala Harris, who was the border czar, who presided, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=59.68s)]
*  if you can use that word, over 11.5 million people invading this country, the worst illegal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=64.28s)]
*  immigration in our nation's history. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=71.19999999999999s)]
*  And Sean, every single week we see another American murdered, another child raped, another [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=73.32s)]
*  person assaulted by violent illegal immigrants that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democrats [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=79.6s)]
*  are letting go. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=86.44s)]
*  And that is the policy of every Democrat in the Senate today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=88.0s)]
*  And you're introducing legislation about this poor little, this brave little girl, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungre. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=96.6s)]
*  And as you know, I interviewed her mother and her grandfather on this program, and you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=98.36s)]
*  were on with them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=104.24s)]
*  And I'm glad you're doing that, Senator. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=106.0s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=107.32s)]
*  Well, I sat down this weekend with Jocelyn Nungre's mom, Alexis, and with Jocelyn's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  grandfather, Kelvin, and the agony they're facing, that beautiful 12-year-old angel who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=114.72s)]
*  was viciously assaulted and murdered by two illegal aliens that Joe Biden and the Democrats [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  had apprehended and that they released. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=126.28s)]
*  They let go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=128.4s)]
*  And it is tragic. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  It is the worst nightmare for any parent. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  And what's infuriating is it was utterly preventable. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=134.56s)]
*  And so this week, I'm introducing the Justice for Jocelyn Act. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=138.68s)]
*  The Justice for Jocelyn Act, I've drafted working with the family, Jocelyn's mom, working [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=141.16s)]
*  with her grandfather. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=146.4s)]
*  And it is designed to prohibit the federal government from releasing illegal aliens if [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=148.28s)]
*  there are any detention facilities available, if there are any beds available. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=153.92s)]
*  When this administration released those murderers, there were 3,000 empty beds that they could [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=158.76s)]
*  have put them in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=163.84s)]
*  But they just let them go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=164.84s)]
*  And so the Justice for Jocelyn Act says if there's a single empty bed, you have to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=165.88s)]
*  fill it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=170.04s)]
*  You have to pursue every means possible to detain someone who's here illegally. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=171.04s)]
*  If anyone's released, they have to be on an ankle monitor at all times. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=176.2s)]
*  And it also mandates — and this is actually an idea Jocelyn's grandfather came up with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=180.38s)]
*  — it mandates if anyone is released with an ankle monitor, that they have a curfew. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=184.88s)]
*  From 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., they're not allowed to leave the house, because when these two [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=189.86s)]
*  monsters targeted that little girl, it was late at night. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=194.34s)]
*  And we can prevent this by not releasing violent illegal aliens. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=198.78s)]
*  Let me ask you about the SAFE Act passed in the House today. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=204.26s)]
*  Why won't Democrats codify into law a vote where illegal immigrants can't vote? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=206.98s)]
*  Why are they against voter ID? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=212.42s)]
*  Why are they against other integrity measures like signature verification? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=214.22s)]
*  I would think that they want integrity in our elections. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=218.94s)]
*  Clearly, they do not. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=221.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=222.66s)]
*  Look, sadly, they don't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=223.74s)]
*  You know, a decade ago, you could get some degree of bipartisan agreement on voter fraud [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=225.46s)]
*  and election integrity. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=232.14s)]
*  What has happened in the last decade is unprecedented, which is one of the two major parties, the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=233.46s)]
*  Democrat Party, has decided that voter fraud is good for them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=238.42s)]
*  They affirmatively want voter fraud. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=242.22s)]
*  The SAFE Act is a simple common sense. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=244.38s)]
*  It prohibits illegal aliens from voting in federal elections, and the Democrats are party [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=247.14s)]
*  line opposed to it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they're all opposed to it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=253.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=256.42s)]
*  Because the 11.5 million illegal aliens that Joe Biden and the Democrats have let in, they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=257.42s)]
*  want them to vote because they think and believe they will vote for Democrats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=261.9s)]
*  They will vote for these open border policies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=266.3s)]
*  And so they're willing to look the other way at the people who are dying. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=268.86s)]
*  Day after day after day, people are dying. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=273.18s)]
*  But for them, it is all about power. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=276.06s)]
*  This should be real simple. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=277.9s)]
*  If you're a U.S. citizen, you have a right to vote. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=279.54s)]
*  If you're not a U.S. citizen, if you're an illegal alien, it is illegal for you to vote. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=282.22s)]
*  And yet the Democrats want to do everything they can to facilitate that election fraud. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-6owMX53Y&t=295.06s)]
