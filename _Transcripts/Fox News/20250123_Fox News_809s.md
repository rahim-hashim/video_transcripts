# Trump reveals ‘one very big power’ the US has over China
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI)
*  Let me ask about the economy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=0.0s)]
*  OK, so, will the tax cuts be permanent? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=2.2s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=6.32s)]
*  And explain—when you talk about all of this money under our feet, you know, and the golden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  era of America— [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=21.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=22.48s)]
*  You know, drill baby drill. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=24.48s)]
*  How do you get these companies to invest billions? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=27.64s)]
*  And how quickly are they going to extract this energy and maybe supply Western Europe? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=31.28s)]
*  Because I agree with you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=35.88s)]
*  It's money that will save this country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  We have more oil and gas than any other country, and we're going to have more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=41.56s)]
*  And with ANWR, you know, which he ended—ANWR is the biggest—ANWR could be—that's in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=48.24s)]
*  Alaska—could be as big or bigger than Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=52.0s)]
*  We have more than any other country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=55.76s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=57.08s)]
*  It's a great asset. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=58.08s)]
*  Because China doesn't have that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=59.08s)]
*  I mean, China does not have that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=60.08s)]
*  They have to go out the old-fashioned way and buy it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=61.84s)]
*  We have more than anybody. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=64.64s)]
*  We're going to become a wealthy country again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=65.64s)]
*  And energy is going to lead the way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=69.64s)]
*  But there'll be other things also, tariffs, because tariffs—you know, we were our wealthiest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=71.56s)]
*  in the 1890s. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=76.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=78.12s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=79.12s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to rename Mount McKinley into Mount McKinley, because he was [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=80.28s)]
*  a great president from Ohio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=85.28s)]
*  He came—he was a senator from Ohio. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  He was a very successful businessman who believed strongly in tariffs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=89.36s)]
*  He ran for the Senate he won. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=95.54s)]
*  He ran for the presidency he won. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=97.44s)]
*  He was ultimately assassinated in his second term, but he made the country very rich. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=99.16s)]
*  And Teddy Roosevelt then came along. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=104.92s)]
*  I'm not knocking Teddy Roosevelt, but he spent the money that was made during the McKinley [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=106.84s)]
*  years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=110.64s)]
*  And he did a lot of great things, like building the Panama Canal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=112.64s)]
*  The most expensive thing relatively sp—the most expensive thing we've ever built is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=117.08s)]
*  the Panama Canal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=121.32s)]
*  And you're serious about— [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=122.32s)]
*  And unfortunately, Jimmy Carter gave it away for $1. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=123.32s)]
*  Oh, no, we're going to have to take it back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=126.12s)]
*  China's running the Panama Canal right now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=128.96s)]
*  That wasn't the deal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=131.0s)]
*  And they charged us— [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=132.0s)]
*  It should have never been given. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=133.08s)]
*  But the deal was not that China's going to run the Panama Canal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=134.56s)]
*  If we became energy dominant and we provided all of Western Europe with our energy, wouldn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=138.08s)]
*  that help bankrupt Putin, number one? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=144.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be able to fund his wars. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=146.96s)]
*  And number two, wouldn't—and I think that would make the world a safer place. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=148.52s)]
*  And the amount of money we're talking about, would America become the single most energy-wealthy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=153.48s)]
*  country in the world? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=159.96s)]
*  And what would that mean for paying down our debt, say, for social security? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=161.88s)]
*  We could supply the whole world with energy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=164.44s)]
*  That's what we have. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=167.32s)]
*  For hundreds of years, we could supply the whole—with, at this moment, the best energy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=168.32s)]
*  Because natural gas is clean and it's powerful. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=174.52s)]
*  You need power. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=178.16s)]
*  And it's consistent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=179.56s)]
*  Not like wind. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=180.84s)]
*  The wind blows and then it doesn't blow and the things cost a fortune. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=181.84s)]
*  They're made in China and they kill the birds and they're horrible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't want windmills in this country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=188.56s)]
*  I'm going to put it—we're putting an order on it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=190.16s)]
*  We've already sort of done it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=191.76s)]
*  We don't want windmills. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  If you have a house and you're in vision of a windmill, your house is worth half. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=195.2s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=200.32s)]
*  And nobody wants them and they're the most expensive energy of any kind of energy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=202.6s)]
*  You know what else people don't like? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=206.84s)]
*  Those massive solar fields built over land that cover 10 miles by 10 miles. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=208.2s)]
*  I mean, they're ridiculous, the whole thing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, you know where the panels come from? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=218.32s)]
*  100 percent of the panels? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=220.6s)]
*  They're made in China. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=221.76s)]
*  They're made in China. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=223.0s)]
*  You had a call with President Xi. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=224.6s)]
*  We have three top geopolitical foes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=226.4s)]
*  We have Russia, China and Iran. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=229.76s)]
*  I want to ask you about all three. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=231.76s)]
*  You put out a statement on Putin today. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=233.96s)]
*  We'll get to that, but let's start. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=235.44s)]
*  You had a conversation with President Xi. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=236.72s)]
*  We have problems with them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=240.12s)]
*  They have territorial ambitions with Taiwan, intellectual property theft. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=241.68s)]
*  They're unfair trade practices. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=247.8s)]
*  How'd that conversation go? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=250.28s)]
*  It went fine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  It was a good, friendly conversation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=252.28s)]
*  I had a great relationship with them prior to COVID. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  I had a very good relationship with them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=256.12s)]
*  I thought it was a very good conversation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=258.08s)]
*  We've had other communication before that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=260.32s)]
*  They are a very ambitious country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  He's a very ambitious man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=265.68s)]
*  He's a man that was, you know, I don't want to be naive and say my friend, but he was like my friend. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=267.48s)]
*  We had a very good relationship. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=274.6s)]
*  I had a very good relationship with Putin. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=276.8s)]
*  Also, I have, I would say Iran is a different story. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  I want to be honest with you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=283.32s)]
*  Iran is a whole different thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=285.56s)]
*  That's a religious deal that is very dangerous. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=288.24s)]
*  That's theocracy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=292.72s)]
*  It's a very dangerous situation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=294.2s)]
*  That could be a big problem, you know, with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=296.8s)]
*  Do you think you could make a deal with Xi? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=299.36s)]
*  Do you think that you can prevent Xi from his territorial desire to take Taiwan? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=301.24s)]
*  Can you make a deal with him on making more fair trade practices? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=306.72s)]
*  Because I know you, you're going to go, when you say you... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=312.36s)]
*  No, I can do that because we have something that they want. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  We have, we're the pot of gold. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=317.24s)]
*  Don't forget, we paid, you know, I lost to China last year, one trillion dollars. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  One trillion because of their stupidity with their trade policies. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=326.04s)]
*  Now, I put tariffs on China. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=331.36s)]
*  We took in hundreds of billions of dollars and Biden was unable to end them because it [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=334.8s)]
*  was so much money you couldn't do it in terms of the budget. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=340.28s)]
*  He wanted to end them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=343.2s)]
*  He did everything he could to end them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=344.2s)]
*  He couldn't get it done. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=345.76s)]
*  But we have one very big power over China and that's tariffs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=347.96s)]
*  And they don't want them and I'd rather not have to use it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=354.64s)]
*  But it's a tremendous power over China. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=357.96s)]
*  China gets a lot of its money from the United States. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=360.12s)]
*  They use that money to build the military. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=363.4s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=365.08s)]
*  How come they have hypersonics and Russia has hypersonics? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=366.08s)]
*  We don't. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=370.28s)]
*  Oh, you ready? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=371.28s)]
*  Because during Obama's administration, they stole the design for the... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=372.28s)]
*  Russia stole the design. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=378.64s)]
*  They got it from... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  Us. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  Us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  Some bad person gave them design. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  It was our job. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=386.0s)]
*  Now, I authorized the building of hypersonic and we're doing super hypersonic actually, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=387.32s)]
*  which is even a step better. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=393.32s)]
*  And we'll have them starting fairly shortly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=396.08s)]
*  But Russia got them and they built them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  Whereas they stole them during the Obama administration. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=400.96s)]
*  Obama, not Biden, not anyone else. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=404.56s)]
*  They probably stole plenty from Biden. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=407.04s)]
*  We'll hear about that too. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=408.4s)]
*  But they stole the hypersonic stuff and they made hypersonic missiles. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=410.08s)]
*  We have the resources for the next generation of warfare. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=416.24s)]
*  I don't believe we're going to fight future wars on battlefields. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  They're going to be fought in air conditioned offices. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=423.48s)]
*  Much different. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  I heard you say that last night. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  They're going to be fought in a lot of different ways, including offices. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  But very big things are becoming drones now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=432.44s)]
*  Drones are becoming more important than jets. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=436.32s)]
*  You push a button. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=438.04s)]
*  I said the other day to somebody with great knowledge who actually were bringing into [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=439.04s)]
*  the administration, I was saying a certain type of fighter jet that I really like. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=442.76s)]
*  He said, well, it's good if you don't like the pilot that flies it because the chances [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=447.16s)]
*  of him coming back are very small. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  You said in other words, technology is changing and we have to be in the front of it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  We have to be. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  And you said that about AI, which I believe is brilliant. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  You put out a truth on Vladimir Putin today. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=463.56s)]
*  You seem to have had a relationship with him that and you've talked about ending this [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=468.36s)]
*  war in Europe and you want to end it quickly. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=476.48s)]
*  How quickly can it end? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=480.56s)]
*  Should end immediately. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=482.48s)]
*  Should have never started. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=483.48s)]
*  That would never have started if I were. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=485.4s)]
*  I used to talk to Putin about it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=487.04s)]
*  Ukraine was the apple of his eye, but there was no chance that he would ever do it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=489.52s)]
*  And he didn't do it for four years. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=492.88s)]
*  He didn't have you spoken to him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=494.56s)]
*  I don't want to say, but I will tell you it's got to end. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  And if you look at the I'm just talking from a human life. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=500.72s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=504.36s)]
*  Ukraine, he was these are human beings that are just being slaughtered on this battlefield [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  by the millions. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=511.44s)]
*  They've already died in cities. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=513.36s)]
*  The cities are like demolition sites. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  There are many people that one thing with the Ukraine war, you're going to find many [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=516.88s)]
*  more people died than think. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a war that should have never started. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=524.26s)]
*  Biden did a horrible, horrible job in allowing that war to start. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=528.0s)]
*  Should have never started. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=532.04s)]
*  It would have never started. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=533.16s)]
*  It wasn't even tough from that standpoint. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=534.24s)]
*  One thing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=537.12s)]
*  So he allowed energy to go up way up. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=538.12s)]
*  If he brought it down, the war wouldn't have started because Putin wouldn't have had the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=540.48s)]
*  money. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=544.44s)]
*  Putin makes all his money on energy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=545.44s)]
*  And Biden let it go to a record. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=547.4s)]
*  And Putin had so much money, he was able to do it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=551.16s)]
*  But that's only one thing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=553.6s)]
*  That wasn't even the biggest reason. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=555.52s)]
*  What was said at the time was so bad. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=558.08s)]
*  He's going to drive that guy into doing this. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=561.24s)]
*  A minor incursion. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=564.24s)]
*  When he said that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=565.24s)]
*  Well, he used the word minor incursion. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=566.24s)]
*  But he said things worse than that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=569.08s)]
*  And Putin shouldn't have done it, too. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=571.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not blaming only one. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=572.84s)]
*  Putin shouldn't have done it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=575.04s)]
*  He shouldn't have done it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=576.32s)]
*  And it has to stop. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=578.32s)]
*  Do you know they've lost about 850,000 Russian soldiers and 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=579.32s)]
*  And Ukraine has been devastated. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=585.32s)]
*  Devastated. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  Will it be a negotiated settlement? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=589.88s)]
*  And will you lead the negotiating? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, I hope so. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  And I put out a truth today that's really strong. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=594.28s)]
*  And I mean it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  And if they don't do that, I'm going to put massive tariffs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=599.04s)]
*  Explain. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=601.04s)]
*  If they don't do what? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=602.04s)]
*  If they don't settle this war soon, like almost immediately, I'm going to put massive [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=603.28s)]
*  tariffs on Russia. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=607.4s)]
*  And massive taxes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=609.28s)]
*  And also big sanctions. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=610.68s)]
*  And I don't want to do that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=614.0s)]
*  You know, I love the Russian people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=615.0s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=616.28s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=617.28s)]
*  But we've got to get this war ended. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=618.48s)]
*  And if they don't make a settlement like fast. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=620.4s)]
*  And Zelensky, I will say this, he wants to settle now. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=622.6s)]
*  He's had enough. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=625.28s)]
*  He shouldn't have allowed this to happen either. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, if he's no angel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=628.04s)]
*  He shouldn't have allowed this war to happen. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  First of all, he's fighting a much bigger entity. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=632.68s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=636.68s)]
*  Much bigger. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=637.68s)]
*  When he was, you know, talking so brave and so on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=639.76s)]
*  Now two things happened. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=642.88s)]
*  They were brave, but we gave them billions of dollars. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  The United States spent $200 billion more than Europe. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  Why did we spend more? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  You know why? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  Because Biden never asked Europe to spend more. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  They spent 200—you know— [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=656.8s)]
*  It became a U.S.—Russia proxy war because of Joe. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=657.8s)]
*  Look, Zelensky was fighting a much bigger entity. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  Much bigger. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=666.28s)]
*  Much more powerful. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=667.4s)]
*  He shouldn't have done that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=668.92s)]
*  Because we could have made a deal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=670.88s)]
*  And it would have been a deal that would have been—it would have been a nothing deal. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=672.5999999999999s)]
*  I could have made that deal so easily. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=676.44s)]
*  And Zelensky decided that I want to fight—you know, they have 30,000 Army tanks. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=678.84s)]
*  Russia has 30,000 Army tanks. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=686.9200000000001s)]
*  Zelensky had none, practically. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=690.08s)]
*  You don't fight those. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=693.32s)]
*  Now then we started pouring equipment, pouring, pouring, pouring. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=695.32s)]
*  And they had the bravery to use the equipment. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=699.72s)]
*  In the end, that's a war that has to be settled. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=703.64s)]
*  So the field is interesting because it's very flat. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  It's great farmland, okay? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  It's very flat. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=711.24s)]
*  There's no protection. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=712.24s)]
*  The only thing that's stopping a bullet that gets shot—they can go for miles—is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=713.24s)]
*  a human body. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=718.16s)]
*  And they're being hit left and right. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN0nR8Rx0KI&t=719.92s)]
